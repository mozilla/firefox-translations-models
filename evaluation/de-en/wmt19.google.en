DFB boss Grindel sees no basis for Özil&#39;s comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil to return to the national team.
&quot;That&#39;s a question that of course depends on having a conversation, on talking to him about why he obviously felt one way or the other the way it was stated in his statement,&quot; Grindel said in football -Podcast &quot;phrase mower&quot; of the &quot;Bild-Zeitung&quot;.
Despite the month-long debate about Özil&#39;s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of 92-time international Özil.
&quot;I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed up to a point that that would be the case,&quot; said Grindel.
The 29-year-old announced his resignation from the DFB team in July and justified this by saying that Grindel had not defended him against racist hostilities during the World Cup.
The DFB boss repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with national coach Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn&#39;t want to put pressure on, but he knows it from football that when &quot;you leave a team or change clubs, you talk to your coach about it and I think it&#39;s a shame that this conversation hasn&#39;t taken place so far.&quot; .
Linz: garden hut in allotment garden settlement burned
At 2:13 p.m., the Linz professional fire brigade was alerted to a fire in Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the allotment garden settlement, danger was imminent.
The professional fire brigade moved out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
Almost all of the roof had to be removed and fire debris cleared to the extent that was absolutely necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden shed, he had plugged in a battery for charging at noon.
That could possibly be the cause of the fire.
In any case, according to the fire department, the charger was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as has the cause of the fire.
However, it should be considerable, because the owner had many collector&#39;s items in his garden shed.
Angry mother fights back: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on the street
What drove Lindsay Lohan to do this extremely strange action?
Apparently she wanted to snatch the children from an alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, &quot;Herbie: Fully Loaded&quot;) streamed live how she apparently wants to snatch the children from a family in Moscow.
This is reported by the US portal &quot;TMZ&quot; and publishes a partial recording of the stream.
Here you can see &quot;Fortunately Kissed&quot; with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip, Lohan can be seen getting out of a car and walking over to a family who may be homeless, who they claim are identified as a refugee family from Syria.
When the family flees from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
She accuses the adults of trafficking in children.
She provides no evidence of any of this in the clip.
&quot;The whole world is watching,&quot; Lohan says in the video as she continues to follow the family down the street.
Apparently she tries to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, the obviously angry mother seems to have had enough.
It looks like she turns around and slaps Lohan in the face.
With tears, the actress then protests how shocked she is – and she holds her cheek.
It is currently unclear what prompted Lohan to take this action.
Landing on Ryugu: &quot;Mascot&quot; has this task on the asteroid
The Hayabusa2 probe was launched in Japan in December 2014.
She is said to get so close to the asteroid Ryugu that she can suck in material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The &quot;Mascot&quot; lander will remain on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: the number of deaths in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
At least 420 people died after the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
The number of victims could continue to rise.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and cut off areas.
Elon Musk steps down as Tesla board chairman
In the beginning there was a tweet.
Tesla boss Elon Musk caused turmoil on the stock markets in early August when he announced that the electric car manufacturer would withdraw.
The US Securities and Exchange Commission sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla boss is retiring from the supervisory board, but he can remain chairman of the board.
British Conservative Party Conference
Sharply guarded - the party convention of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage for a power struggle.
The party conference is supposed to be about foreign policy, trade issues and development policy, but the four-day conference is overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, with ex-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson at the forefront.
Referendum for a new state name
The foreign ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have already reached an agreement
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing about this duplication of names for years.
Now they have reached an agreement.
The state of Macedonia should be called North Macedonia in the future and the population will vote on this this Sunday - will it go well?
Protests in Brazil against right-wing populists Bolsonaro.
&quot;Ele Nao&quot; (&quot;He&#39;s not&quot;) - meaning Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The &quot;Trump of Brazil&quot; presents itself as an anti-system candidate and is thus ahead in the polls.
His closest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers&#39; Party.
Audi: &quot;Dieselgate&quot; processing takes longer than planned
&quot;The diesel task force is still there,&quot; said Development Board member Peter Mertens to the industry journal &quot;Automobilwoche&quot;.
The imprisoned and suspended Audi boss Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
&quot;In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations are expected to be tested,&quot; he said at the time.
Mertens now said: &quot;At the beginning of July we reached an important milestone in dealing with the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was founded in September 2015 after the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi&#39;s parent company, Volkswagen.
Mertens emphasized that the carmaker had made &quot;serious organizational changes&quot; so that such a scandal would never happen again.
The VW supervisory board had postponed a decision on Stadler&#39;s future on Friday and wants to discuss it further this Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the Audi boss of having allowed the sale of diesel cars with false exhaust emissions after the exhaust gas fraud became known.
He knew about the manipulations or deliberately ignored them.
Sales director Bram Schot is currently managing the company as acting CEO.
Because of the switch to the new emissions and consumption test standard WLTP, there are production losses at Audi, said Schot of the &quot;Heilbronner Voice&quot;.
Basically, he sees a falling demand for sedans like the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
&quot;The segment itself is difficult,&quot; he said.
Schot relies on electromobility.
There are already 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric car.
Grindel is aiming for re-election - Lahm should be in the DFB presidium
Mainz (dpa) - Reinhard Grindel wants to run again for the post of DFB president next year, despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair.
&quot;I do my job and try to do it as well as I can,&quot; said Grindel as a guest on ZDF&#39;s &quot;Aktuelle Sportstudio&quot; early on Sunday morning.
You always have to try to get re-elected, and I will do that.
And then you have to see if the support is there.
In his own words, the head of the association would find it &quot;strange&quot; if, after being awarded the European Football Championship in 2024, he &quot;didn&#39;t feel like working on the future project&quot;.
Grindel has been head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who fell over the summer fairy tale affair.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first full term of three years.
The next vote is scheduled for the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future EM chief organizer Philipp Lahm should work on the DFB presidium.
&quot;I would be happy if my colleagues on the presidency would agree that he would continue to advise the presidency in this role in the future and would then of course be cordially invited to make his experience available on sporting issues,&quot; said Grindel.
He did not want to take part in speculation as to whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB boss.
As a consequence of the affair surrounding the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the wish that a national player without a migration background should become the DFB&#39;s integration ambassador in the future.
This office is currently held by Cacau, a native of Brazil, and Celia Sasic, the latter of whom has family roots in Cameroon.
&quot;If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says, &#39;The issue is important, we have to take care of it&#39;, that would also be an initiative to create a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work,&quot; said Grindel.
Lose weight correctly with half-smart scales
I&#39;ve had a new toy for four weeks.
A scale that not only measures my weight, but also my body fat percentage.
It can also indicate muscle and bone mass.
The thing also calculates the body mass index, but that’s more of a non-issue.
It doesn&#39;t say anything about whether I&#39;ve replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: Clear opening successes for Berlin and Oldenburg
Berlin - ALBA Berlin started the new season of the basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
The runner-up easily won against Science City Jena with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing game over 40 minutes.
Newcomer Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 points), signed from Ludwigsburg, also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators on his competitive debut.
Ex-champion Brose Bamberg won coach Ainars Bagatskis&#39; competitive debut with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the guests&#39; best thrower with 24 points.
Würzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni scored 14 points.
Last year&#39;s playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the most accurate shooter in coach John Patrick&#39;s team with 24 points.
The EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At the Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
The new playmaker Will Cummings towered over the Oldenburgers with 25 points.
Braunschweig, where NBA star Dennis Schröder has been the majority owner since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run by the Baskets quickly cleared things up.
Erdoğan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdoğan had previously met with Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite supporters of the Gülen movement living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens - no matter where they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to shake our citizens and damage German-Turkish friendship,&quot; he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, Cologne city center was partially closed.
Several thousand police officers were deployed - including snipers.
The Islam association Ditib has been criticized for being seen as an extension of the Turkish government.
&quot;Global Citizen Festival&quot;: Music against poverty: stars, boos and moments of shock
At a joint concert in New York&#39;s Central Park, musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B called for more commitment to the fight against poverty and disease.
&quot;Get involved wherever you can,&quot; said Mendes at the festival on Sunday night in front of around 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it&#39;s a dream.
Cardi B performed in a red outfit with fringes and a gold microphone.
I&#39;m nervous, I&#39;m sweating, but it&#39;s okay because I&#39;m here and I&#39;m ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker as well as representatives from governments, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on stage during the spectacle that lasted several hours.
In between, however, there was a moment of shock when many spectators mistook the sound of a metal barrier falling for shots, got scared and tried to flee.
Panic broke out for a moment, people ran all over the place.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh Evans.
However, the New York police and musician Chris Martin then calmed people down from the stage.
&quot;No one is trying to hurt anyone,&quot; Martin said.
You are all safe.
As every year, tickets for the &quot;Global Citizen Festival&quot; concert were available free of charge on the Internet.
Anyone who wanted to get hold of one had to read and distribute texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and disease on the internet.
The audience cheered and applauded the numerous musicians and actors, while Republican Senator Jeff Flake booed.
Together with his democratic colleague Chris Coons, he spoke out on stage for more equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake spoke out in the US Senate Judiciary Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for Supreme Court Justice, alienating many women.
At least three women have made allegations of abuse, including attempted rape, against Kavanaugh, which Kavanaugh denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who said they had experienced sexual assault confronted him in an elevator on his way to the committee meeting.
&quot;You&#39;re welcome to join me in an elevator at any time,&quot; Flake said to the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: the federal government defends the expulsion of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference by Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the Chancellery, the Turkish journalist, who lives in Hamburg, put on a T-shirt with the Turkish and German words &quot;Freedom for Journalists&quot; on it and went into the front row.
The T-shirt wasn&#39;t the problem, Seibert told Bild am Sonntag.
It was about disrupting the course of the press conference.
The journalist&#39;s action caused a great deal of unrest, which was unacceptable.
He therefore arranged for bodyguards to take the man out.
Seibert said that demonstrating political concerns at press conferences in the Federal Chancellery was not permitted.
This applies completely regardless of whether the request is legitimate or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage activities or supporting or belonging to banned parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists face several decades in prison.
Foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities either: the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was only arrested at the beginning of September.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, trials against the two are still ongoing in Turkey.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans usually know him as fresh and handsome: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice: Yes, that&#39;s really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show &quot;Inas Nacht&quot; produced by NDR is known for boozy conversations at the bar of the Hamburg harbor pub &quot;Schellfischposten&quot;.
Presenter Ina Müller and her guests toast to some beer, some wine or even high-proof drinks to loosen up the mood and tongues.
Quite a few celebrities also drink courage for the obligatory singing performances.
Another episode of the popular talk show was taped on Friday.
This time there: The actor Florian David Fitz, known from films such as &quot;Men&#39;s Hearts&quot;, &quot;Terror - Your Judgment&quot; or &quot;The Hottest Day&quot;.
However, the excursion to the far north did not do the Munich resident any good.
On Saturday he posted a selfie – his face is completely crumpled on it, his eyes are only two small slits.
The bed selfie shows a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he just has a mighty hangover.
Addressing his fans, he posted some – probably not entirely serious – insights that he has now gained: &quot;Rule one: NEVER go to Ina&#39;s night.
Rule two: never drink the black sow.
And spray.
And skip the round of eggnog that Ina throws at two thirty.
Alcohol consumption is really written all over the 43-year-old&#39;s face.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant broth, fish rolls or - probably most expediently - headache pills.
Others simply amused themselves at the sight of the normally handsome movie star.
It is not yet known how Ina Müller survived the nocturnal binge.
Since she has been moderating the TV fun at the counter since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more tried and tested...
For a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa struggles with vandalism and debris
The entrance to the 36-kilometer-long railway cycle path in Little Red Riding Hood country in Treysa is difficult to find and littered.
Recipes against the rampant vandalism are being sought, but there are hardly any solutions.
Broken glass, cigarette butts, rubbish and rubbish, trash cans that have been demolished and signs that have now been removed - this is how the entrance with a seating area to the cycle path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been for a long time.
A more than inglorious sight for the showpiece Bahnradweg in Little Red Riding Hood country.
The topic has been occupying members of the ADFC local group in Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to Ulrich Wüstenhagen, the city’s cycling officer.
The problem had already been addressed in the cycling advisory board.
So far there is no solution.
The suggestions ranged from relocating the seating area to regular emptying of the waste bins and cleaning of the surfaces at the entry point.
&quot;I think the latter would be the order of the day - regardless of possible other activities,&quot; says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been brought up in the local advisory board.
It&#39;s not just the rubbish that worries cyclists and residents - the seating area is a regular meeting place to celebrate at weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, there is also destruction during the feasts: posts are torn out of the ground, rubbish bins are demolished, signs are bent over, furniture is smeared.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert says that volunteers have already cleaned up more often.
But the actions are just the proverbial drop in the bucket.
They are annoyed that the rest area on the bike path in Treysa is a meeting point for drinking bouts.
&quot;Along the entire cycle path, the focus is clearly on the Haaße hill,&quot; confirms the cycle traffic officer, who is now also concerned about the new cycle center in Ziegenhain, which is opening today.
&quot;If she suffers the same fate, it will be really expensive.&quot;
Another idea is video surveillance on the hill: &quot;It may be that the threshold for tampering with common property is significantly higher.
However, that would require a police patrol to come by in a timely manner.
In principle, Wüstenhagen wants the Haasse hill to be developed.
It needs to be made more attractive.
One can be very satisfied with the frequency of use of the cycle path so far.
Tourist marketing is still expandable.
Our cycle path is of very high quality compared to others in Germany,&quot; say the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation on Ascheröder Straße in Treysa as an extremely critical danger point.
There is no turning lane onto the Haaße hill.
In heavy traffic it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between two-way traffic flow,&quot; she explains.
This is not a problem for sporty drivers, but it is for older people and especially children.
Music contest in the Kulturbahnhof: The &quot;Kö von Hiltrup&quot; and the lake
The first call for the music contest was a success, creative and collaborative.
&quot;D a song for Hiltrup&quot; is the appeal of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the &quot;music contest for big and small, young and experienced musicians&quot;.
A contest &quot;with a wink in the friendly Hiltruper family&quot;, as Karl Franke put it.
In fact, it soon became a family get-together over coffee and cake from the volunteers at the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven formations competed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an Albachtener who had lived in Hiltrup for a long time, the nine from the &quot;Hiltruper Sternfarben&quot;, three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the Lummerland kindergarten and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
District Mayor Joachim Schmidt explained that this contest was something new.
We haven&#39;t experienced that in other parts of the city.
What did the copywriters feel connected to?
When it came to places, Lake Hiltruper and Marktallee were mentioned particularly often.
Rolf Ihmig named the avenue &quot;Kö von Hiltrup&quot; in his hit-like song.
The Kulturbahnhof was also recognized.
Again and again it was about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke enlivened the short changeover breaks with short interviews with the performers or information about their work.
So we learned from Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but was now also teaching guitar.
Franke knew that the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has meanwhile placed all sorts of things on YouTube.
&quot;It&#39;s not about winning,&quot; Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
There was still something special for the jury&#39;s favorites - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can record a whole CD with sound engineer Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup Schlager, which particularly impressed Franke with its musicality, and the &quot;Lummerland-Rudel&quot;: &quot;a very nice performance&quot; with ten children and two teachers on guitar and cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Toelle.
Like everyone else, the children performed again for the finale - and sounded &quot;really good&quot; even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller from the Westfälische Schule für Musik, Andreas Klomfaß from the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Wirtschaftsverbund as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of its tenth anniversary.
She rated the event as a complete success.
Everyone is &quot;very satisfied&quot; and &quot;the atmosphere was good&quot; in the Kulturbahnhof, which will soon be very full.
The word game: &quot;Decrypto&quot; in the game test
The players form two teams that sit opposite each other.
There&#39;s a screen for each page, and inside are four cards with keywords that—the old red foil trick—you can&#39;t decipher until you put them inside.
This ensures that the other party cannot read anything, even by mistake.
The cards then read, for example, from left to right: &quot;1. Renaissance.
2 Windows.
3. Dice.
4th Feast&quot;.
These are the terms that need to be encoded from now on.
Because it is not the terms that are to be guessed here, but codes.
Alternately one player per team is the scrambler.
He gets a code card that might say &quot;3.4.2&quot;. stands.
In &quot;Decrypto&quot; it is not the terms behind the secret foil that are to be guessed, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: He should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms &quot;cube&quot;, &quot;fixed&quot; and &quot;window&quot; - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does not ; because that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the scrambler notes and reads aloud: &quot;Toss&quot; for the dice, &quot;Lose&quot; as opposed to hard; Of course, something like &quot;Party&quot; would also be possible here, and &quot;Prague&quot; because he paid attention at school and knows the lintel there.
It goes on like this, round after round, team after team.
You don&#39;t know the other party&#39;s terms - but you can put them together better with every hint that the encryptor gives there.
The descriptions should be as mysterious as possible, but not too crazy, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
Unfortunately, the most cryptic thing about &quot;Decrypto&quot; is the rulebook.
The other players will probably have to study it for a long time and in detail before they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info online makes it easier.
But once you&#39;ve gotten started, you&#39;ll be fascinated by how much emotion there is in this inconspicuous game.
Overall, however, &quot;Decrypto&quot; is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre leader &quot;Codenames&quot;, which also puts an agent theme on a game of few words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And if you only care about guessing and not about victory points, you can easily invent a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows police Nazi salute and harassed guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspection twice in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
First he showed the Nazi salute to a passing police patrol in the Upper Town, later he also attracted attention in a pub in the Upper Town when he was bothering other guests.
After he was clearly intoxicated and did not comply with the eviction issued by the police, he had to spend the night in the detention cell at the Kulmbach police station.
When he is sober, he must then also be held criminally responsible for using signs belonging to unconstitutional organizations.
The Pressig depot was home to the pusher locomotives
The railway depot in Pressig was the turntable in the Franconian Forest for decades.
A piece of railway history ended in 1991.
&quot;When buffers banged against buffers, you could hear it all over Pressig,&quot; remembers Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
That didn&#39;t upset anyone.
The brakes squeaked and the wagons rattled.
That was pure railroading.
Statements that symbolize Dinkels Heimat Pressig.
Nowhere else in the Franconian Forest was a place so shaped by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the steep ramp mountain route to the north, which, after an increase of around 220 meters in altitude, has its apex in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, train and pusher locomotives were needed, which had their home in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian state parliament approved the construction of a railway workshop with 21 locomotive sheds, apprentice workshops, catenary and railway maintenance department.
&quot;The centerpiece was the turntable, which after a conversion in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters,&quot; says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, railway historian and professional railway worker for 47 years.
From the Bahnbetriebswerk (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locomotives were also operated for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15, 1950, the &quot;Volksblatt&quot; reported a workforce of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for train and pusher locomotives.
From 1977 they were only used on freight trains.
Up until 1991, at least 10,000 wagons were shunted each month.
In 1982 parts of the depot were demolished, in 1991 the rest.
Heidrich: &quot;It is unfortunate that a better use of the location, also in terms of freight traffic, was not envisaged&quot;.
At Pentecost 1989, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated &quot;50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld&quot; with a pompous station festival in Pressig.
&quot;There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,&quot; remembers Georg Dinkel.
A little later the end.
On June 1, 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
&quot;The shunters and brakeman did the most difficult work in train traffic,&quot; remembers Dinkel.
Any mistake would have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen train station led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many other historical and current pictures can be found here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber with opening success at China Open
Beijing (AP) - Wimbledon champion Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have reached the second round of the tennis tournament in Beijing, like Julia Görges before them.
Kerber won the China Open 6-2, 6-2 against French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the third in the world rankings is either Julia Putinzewa from Kazakhstan or the Spaniard Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina when the number 13 seeded Russian gave up.
The Swabian is now dealing with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the &quot;Art and Enjoyment&quot; series, a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach at the weekend.
It was with great relief that the organizers and visitors registered the perfect weather when the special vernissage &quot;Windspiel-Performance&quot; opened in the outdoor area of the Dahlmann-Schmidt estate in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes place under the umbrella of the tourism association &quot;Rund ums Walberla&quot; as part of the &quot;Art and Pleasure&quot; series.
This opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large number of visitors showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies by 20 artists can now be seen in Mittelehrenbach.
Host Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists to the opening of the vernissage.
He&#39;s been there from day one.
Just like Volker Hahn, who made a name for himself as the main organizer and artist in equal measure.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer, however, he placed his task in reliable, young hands with good future prospects.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in selecting the artists and helping to design flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Art &amp; Enjoyment, there will be a 70-cent special stamp designed by you, available at every art station.
This year&#39;s poster &quot;Betzn austanzen&quot;, designed by Volker Hahn, can also be purchased there for eight euros.
Hahn was delighted with the popularity of the special exhibition.
Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg could be won for the musical accompaniment.
When walking through the spacious garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title &quot;Wind Chime Performance&quot; formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often with color accents.
Already at the entrance to the property, the visitor is awaited on the right side by the &quot;Tree of Luck&quot; by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree stump, lightened in color, playfully provided with 20 windmills, 24 horseshoes and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun shining through the bushes in the background, the property looks dreamy and invites you to linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to use three-dimensional letters to mark the occasion of 15 years of K&amp;G.
There are many parts moving in the wind.
Halfway, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work &quot;The Wind, the Heavenly Child&quot;.
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful fantasy structure made of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The topic &quot;wind chime performance&quot; invites you to stroll through the varied art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until December 31, 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - that was the time of the protest and the student movement.
And the Albachtener also vented their displeasure at the time.
At least five of them.
They absolutely did not want to accept that after the dissolution of the church choir &quot;Cäcilia&quot; there would be no more singing in the district.
It has now become a legend: they launched the MGV 68 Albachten on a bench in the Tinnenbusch.
That was 50 years ago.
Now the anniversary has been celebrated in the &quot;House of Encounters&quot;.
&quot;It&#39;s going to be full today,&quot; suspected chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was to be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the singers from Albachten.
They had revived the foundation festival especially for the anniversary.
It was a tradition for years, then there was a break.
The traditional festival was back just in time for the 50th anniversary.
It turned out to be an elegant ball, and festive attire had been requested beforehand.
The guests did not sit in rows of seats as they usually do in the &quot;House of Encounters&quot;, but comfortably at tables.
In between, movement was the order of the day: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln turned on the controls and invited people onto the dance floor.
It was a matter of honor that the singers from MGV 68 Albachten let the voices ring out themselves.
Cheerful songs were the order of the day.
Almost set: &quot;Such a day, as beautiful as today&quot;.
Matching the exquisite grape juice that many had in front of them, there was the &quot;Rüdesheimer Wein&quot;.
&quot;Humulus lupulus,&quot; which is Latin for &quot;hops,&quot; sounded an allusion to another cool drink.
The choir direction by Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the Tinnenbusch at the time, was sovereign again.
&quot;It&#39;s just fun to sing under his direction,&quot; said Holstiege: &quot;He has such an easy way, it&#39;s a masterpiece that he accomplishes&quot;. By the way, not only men presented themselves as singers this time.
The women&#39;s choir &quot;Hohes C&quot; was also a guest, whose repertoire mainly includes evergreens from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Finally, there was poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create his own rhymes.
And Andreas Winterhoff also presented melodious poetry.
There was also a big raffle.
The proceeds are intended to finance a visit to the all-weather zoo for the children of the Albatros youth center.

Volleyball: 3rd league women: USC II wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The climber marches.
Three games, three wins - the reserves of USC Münster, under the patronage of Axel Büring, are doing really well in league three.
Not a trace of shyness or tails, the independents do their thing.
And that was really good in the 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t crystal clear, but we made an impression,&quot; says the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately agreed: &quot;It&#39;s a defeat that we can live with very well.
We are not dissatisfied&quot;. On the contrary.
In the evening at a belated birthday party for Ronja de Boer, the atmosphere was good and the game was over.
Yes, the result is indeed an optical illusion.
In the third set, the guests had a set point.
&quot;If they get that to the finish line, a game like that can tip over,&quot; Büring knows from years of experience.
Finally, the USC made everything clear with its experienced forces and brought the full yield to the finish.
&quot;We all know who&#39;s on the other side in a derby like this.
That doesn&#39;t break our necks.
I saw really good volleyball at times,&quot; said Annacker, not quarreling with the 0: 3 - and immediately went on with the agenda.
Where the journey for the independents will go does not seem to be foreseeable after just three matchdays.
&quot;It&#39;s just too early for that,&quot; says Axel Büring.
He only feels confirmed in one thing: &quot;The 3rd division has an incredibly good level.
It&#39;s not nearly comparable to regional league volleyball.&quot; They don&#39;t want to look down into the fourth division anyway.
If the vest doesn&#39;t get soiled in the next few weeks, they&#39;ll have to look up.
An initial balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we go to Emlichheim.
Aasee competes in Essen on October 14th.

Of course, the fans are already thinking about a successor.
While Didi Kühbauer is considered a favorite, some fans show humor.

Glider crashes - student pilot died in an accident
The pilot died when a glider crashed in Essen.
The single-seater plane fell on Sunday afternoon when landing in a parking lot near Essen-Mülheim Airport, a police spokesman said on Sunday in Essen.
The parking lot next to Autobahn 52, which is normally used for shuttle traffic to the fair, was largely empty, other people were not injured in the crash.
Emergency chaplains continued to look after flight students and eyewitnesses on site.
The location of an Oktoberfest was in the immediate vicinity, and numerous guests were expected there in the evening.
The cause of the crash was initially unclear - the weather was good, there was light wind and sunshine.
Essen-Mülheim is a small airport, which is used a lot by pilots with light private planes.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
Heide Keller became a star on the &quot;Dream Ship&quot;.
Now she speaks openly about the fact that the series could have been partly to blame for her marriage to Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) made her role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the &quot;Traumschiff&quot; famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her a star could be partly responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she was married for ten years.
&quot;That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled the world alone with a suitcase and many of my admired colleagues saw me as equals,&quot; says Keller in an interview with &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot;.
At first she was always just &quot;Hans von Borsody&#39;s wife&quot;, but that changed with the &quot;dream ship&quot;.
Because now the journalists only called Heide Keller.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if he liked it that much.&quot;
She thinks it&#39;s possible that her husband at the time might have been jealous, but &quot;like many men, Hans also shied away from talking about problems and feelings&quot;.
Keller always tried to &quot;be the only right person for Hans von Borsody and he didn&#39;t want to get to know my fears, my weaknesses.
That means in good German: I have disguised myself&quot;, as she explains further.
She always had the feeling &quot;not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which I never really was, even if I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever&quot;.
After a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, &quot;although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time&quot;.
The day before the civil wedding I sat crying in the cloakroom and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody also failed.
Why did it never work out with the men?
Because I wanted too much.
At the time, Keller imagined love “like in the film.
Unfortunately, this vision is not suitable for everyday use.
I approached love far too naively&quot;.
The moth, which regularly explores the city&#39;s nightlife in the NZZ department in Zurich, dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our moth is not a moth, but it is a little afraid of light.
And the glare in which a green carpet on the Sechseläutenplatz is bathed blinds him unduly.
But it&#39;s a film festival, more or less famous people want to bask in the spotlight.
So he staggers across the square on this late Thursday evening to relieve himself briefly in the &quot;Aquaclean-WC-Oasis&quot;.
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company and celebrating its premiere at the festival: the public toilet on the ground floor of a new pavilion makes every effort to exude a luxurious ambience.
That evening, however, it stinks to high heaven in the men&#39;s oasis for some reason.
So get out of here, over to the other side of the street: invited guests, who have just been entertained at the best level by the opening film &quot;Green Book&quot; in the cinema next door, celebrate the start of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store, as they do every year.
Its name fits this film festival perfectly: as is well known, the works shown come from all over the world.
How many ideas do you have to come up with in an article about this festival in order not to fall into surreptitious advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The butterfly ties a ribbon around its feelers that a good fairy gave it, and two brawny bouncers generously wave it in.
Inside, the invited people crowd, they dance to live music well after midnight or let DJs set rhythms for them, to which they shout at each other, and wash down exquisite appetizers with Cüpli.
In the delicatessen in the basement, oysters await slurping mouths, next door the incomparable cured ham Culatello di Zibello is freshly sliced, a chocolate fountain bubbles up.
And the hammer is: all the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared out for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to be working without major losses.
You have to love this country for that!
The butterfly studies the sign by the escalator: &quot;Wear a long dress, please be careful on the escalator&quot;.
If these are two separate instructions, he has made a mistake in the dress code.
But it&#39;s more of a conditional construction, and it&#39;s certainly saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man downs a cocktail made with espresso called &quot;Golden Eye&quot;, to match the festival award.
This mix, presented by a capsule manufacturer, does not necessarily receive the award for the best drink.
And George Clooney, who has been promoting said brand for years, is not here that evening either.
But then, between the local celebrities, the checkout counter and kitchen items, a face passes by that looks familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
His main actor shouldn&#39;t be far from there.
And really: Viggo Mortensen, almost like a choirboy at almost sixty, is about to walk through the crowd.
He is not talked to, not gaped at, at best one squints furtively.
International stars love this film festival precisely for this reluctance, which is often misunderstood as an inhibition.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with cumbia dance
Coach and ex-soccer star Diego Maradona is happy about his team&#39;s victory.
Argentina&#39;s soccer legend Diego Maradona seems to have settled in well in his new home country of Mexico.
After a 2-0 win for his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced to cumbia rhythms with a player in the dressing room, as can be seen in a video published on Saturday.
In a team member&#39;s 15-second clip, Maradona dances in the yellow jersey, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second division team defeated the Leones Negros 2-0 on Saturday.
After the game, Maradona shouted into a TV camera &quot;always with my boys, always&quot;.
The 57-year-old has been coaching the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Verbandsliga 1: ASV Sending &quot;devastated&quot; after the last-minute bankruptcy
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball association league ASV Senden, could hardly believe it: &quot;Such a bitter defeat&quot;. His protégés were &quot;devastated&quot; after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had - like in Steinhagen, like against Hüllhorst - not played badly over long periods, the Senders.
Only the initial phase &quot;we totally slept through&quot;, the ASV trainer was annoyed.
The home side quickly led 8:1, and the time-out that Bieletzki had taken early didn&#39;t work at first.
&quot;But then the team suddenly got a jolt,&quot; Bieletzki summarized the second quarter of an hour.
At the break, the gap was only two goals.
In particular, sending&#39;s best, Marius Hintze, scored time and time again during this phase.
After the change, things got even better from a visitor&#39;s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized to 15:15, then the relay changer led almost continuously.
Four minutes before the siren, the lead was still a reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then?
The referees intervened in the action.
Bieletzki is usually wary of blaming others.
But: The 120-second time penalty that Steffen Mühlhoff received &quot;was a joke&quot;.
LIT had a good laugh and scored four more goals until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The lads fought really well, defended well against seven men and kept throwing at empty goals.
Only they can buy little for the compliments.
&quot;Now a damn victory is needed,&quot; said the completely served Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Huging (1).
Bavaria: woman missing for 30 years - police dig for body parts
More than 30 years after the disappearance of a then 18-year-old from Naila (Hof district), the police are looking for the mortal remains of the woman.
Forces dug up a street near Marxgrün on Saturday.
For this purpose, the road surface and several layers below it were removed, as the police and public prosecutor announced together.
According to new findings, the missing person may have been buried not far from where she lived at the time.
The woman has been missing since November 4, 1986.
The investigators did not rule out a crime at the time.
Since last year, the Hof criminal investigation department has been working intensively again on the case together with the public prosecutor&#39;s office.
Together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Bavarian monument protection authority, the investigators found an abnormality under the road near Marxgrün using ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained to smell human bones, officers narrowed the spot down to a few yards.
The results of the dig should be announced later this afternoon.
The hacker attack on millions of Facebook users shows the dangers lurking on the Internet.
However, users can also provide additional security themselves.
Instead of complicated sequences of letters, users should use passphrases to secure their accounts on the Internet.
In addition, security updates, such as for Windows, should be installed quickly, and it doesn&#39;t hurt to equip computers with anti-virus protection.
Elon Musk, founder of the electric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his imminent dismissal as head of the billionaire company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Commission settled out of court a lawsuit over misleading Twitter messages that could have stripped Musk of his license to conduct publicly traded companies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and Tesla will each pay $20 million, and Musk will also step down as chairman for three years, a position comparable to that of a German supervisory board chairman.
On the other hand, he can remain CEO.
In the settlement, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoing.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the US Federal Court in Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads space company SpaceX, is the public face of the loss-making electric car pioneer, now valued at more than $50 billion on the stock market.
Musk is not aware of any guilt
Musk said he had done nothing wrong and was saddened and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He always acted in the interests of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company public for $420 a share, with funding secured.
That would have valued Tesla at $72 billion overall.
Musk later rowed back: Tesla would remain on the stock exchange.
Following the settlement, Tesla must now find an outside chairman, hire two independent board members, and also set up a committee to oversee Musk&#39;s communications.
Football: Sturridge saves Liverpool: Klopp team 1-1 at Chelsea
Liverpool still drew 1-1 at Chelsea.
In the top game at Chelsea, the attacker who had just been substituted by coach Jürgen Klopp made it 1-1 (0-1) in the 89th minute.
After six wins to start, Liverpool fell back to second place.
Chelsea remains third, the new leader is Manchester City.
Eden Hazard gave Chelsea the lead with his sixth goal of the season in the 25th minute.
After that, the Klopp team missed the equalizer several times.
National player Antonio Rüdiger cleared after a solo by Liverpool striker Mohamed Salah on the line (31st).
Shortly before the end, Sturridge redeemed the Reds with a flick in the corner.
After the worst start to the season since 1989, record champions Manchester United are slipping deeper and deeper into the crisis.
The team of controversial coach José Mourinho lost 1: 3 (0: 2) at West Ham United and remains only in the middle of the table with ten points after seven games.
The pressure on Mourinho will continue to mount ahead of Tuesday&#39;s Champions League match against Valencia.
Former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made his first Premier League appearance after injuring Petr Cech.
Before Tuesday&#39;s Champions League game at 1899 Hoffenheim, Manchester City beat Brighton &amp; Hove Albion 2-0 with goals from Raheem Sterling (29&#39;) and Sergio Agüero (65&#39;).
Leroy Sané prepared the 1-0, Ilkay Gündogan was not used by the new leader.
&quot;Let&#39;s Dance&quot; juror Joachim Llambi and wife Ilona separated
Joachim Llambi has probably separated from his wife Ilona.
The dance expert became known through the RTL show &quot;Let&#39;s Dance&quot;.
After 13 years of marriage, Joachim Llambi (54) and his wife Ilona (45) are now separated.
The &quot;Bild am Sonntag&quot; (Bezhalcontent) reports, citing Llambi&#39;s lawyer, about the separation of the well-known presenter and dance expert.
&quot;Our clients have separated amicably and amicably,&quot; said lawyer Christian-Oliver Moser, according to &quot;BamS&quot;.
The most important thing for them now is the well-being of their two daughters.
According to the report, the couple met in a pizzeria in 2003 and married two years later.
Joachim Llambi comes from Duisburg and was a successful tournament dancer and stockbroker.
Llambi became known on television through his work as a juror on the celebrity dance show &quot;Let&#39;s Dance&quot; on RTL, as well as through various appearances in quiz and entertainment programs.

Polls: 46 percent do not want Merkel to be chancellor by 2021
After the quarrels of the past few weeks, GroKo has received several low blows in the survey.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a survey - Angela Merkel is viewed critically.
Berlin – The AfD has overtaken the SPD nationwide for the first time in the Emnid Sunday trend for the picture on Sunday.
In the weekly survey by the opinion research institute, the AfD increased by one point to 17 percent, the SPD lost one point compared to the previous week and ended up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a point and only get 27 percent.
This is the lowest value for the Union in the Sunday trend so far.
The Greens get 15 percent, the Left 11 and the FDP 10 percent.
According to Emnid, if there were a general election on Sunday, the governing parties SPD, CDU and CSU would only get 43 percent of the votes.
As a result, the grand coalition has lost the majority in all major research institutes - with the exception of Allensbach - on the Sunday question.
The governing parties consistently get 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 federal election, they received a combined 53.4 percent.
The range is also wide for the other parties: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes in at 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens achieve voting shares of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is an average of 10 percent, FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of 2 to 3 percent up and down, depending on the share of votes.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) among the population has also fallen significantly since the 2017 federal election.
According to the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person for the Chancellery.
According to the survey, only every second person (50 percent) currently wants the grand coalition to last until the next regular federal election in three years; 41 percent are in favor of a new election.
Another survey published on Saturday also showed a significant loss of popularity for Merkel.
Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run again for the CDU presidency in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favor, 44 percent against.
According to this, 64 percent of the Union supporters want a candidacy, 35 percent do not.
Notice at Aldi: Reduced price for the happiness of love
Will Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Anyone who says that in the times of Tinder there are no more romantic introductory stories should talk to Aldi about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital &quot;fast food dating&quot; by Tinder and Co., the supermarket as a meeting place for great love radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, that&#39;s right, a conversation about reduced turkey meat, boxer short bargains at the rummage table or your favorite pudding is always a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less of a dating site and more of a slippery exchange.
We dared the test: How do women react if you don&#39;t beat around the bush in the first message?
Here is the amazing result.
It has real Hollywood love story potential when the happiness in love is preceded by a lost sight of and found again plot.
When the guy then also contacts his beloved at the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, it sounds a lot like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - romantic comedy at it&#39;s best.
So it is to be hoped that the originator of this advertisement in an Aldi branch unknown to us will also find her dream man, with whom she spoke briefly about &quot;30 percent reduced organic turkey meat&quot;.
For believing in the magic of getting to know each other analogously, she definitely deserves her happy ending à la Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 lids for a life without paralysis
Since the beginning of the new school year, the Ludgeri School has been involved in the campaign &quot;Caps against Polio - 500 caps for a life without polio&quot;.
Polio is the abbreviation for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by polio viruses.
The disease, known in German as polio, leads from symptoms of paralysis to death.
Polio is considered eradicated in Germany, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polio virus, can only be contained by vaccination, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc demand rest for Götze
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB sports director Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about Mario Götze&#39;s form and fitness.
&quot;We should stop worrying about Mario.
That&#39;s not good for the boy.
And that&#39;s not good for us,&quot; said Reus, who was a friend of Götze, after the 4-2 win in Leverkusen on Sky TV.
Zorc had already stressed before the game.
It&#39;s not an easy situation for him personally.
Football: Eberl: No rush for contract talks with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (AP) - Manager Max Eberl from the Bundesliga soccer club Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush in a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.
We haven&#39;t even talked about a contract yet.
There is no fixed date when we will do this.
&quot;But there will definitely be a moment when we sit down and talk,&quot; said Eberl on Sunday evening on the Sky TV channel.
Football: district league: researchers appearance of VfL Wolbeck against SC Altenrheine encourages
There were moments in this young season when Alois Fetsch was harsh on his team.
He was taciturn, the coach of the district football club VfL Wolbeck, withdrew (inwardly) to reflect on the lack of motivation on the green.
All history.
Things are now running smoothly again on the Brandhoveweg.
Dewy proof is the 1-1 draw against SC Altenrheine on Sunday, just barely missing promotion last season.
Yes, I am very happy with the performance.
&quot;We narrowed the space and put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of&quot;, Fetsch praised his boys and visited each individual after the game to simply say &quot;thank you&quot; for so much resistance against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to change the system after 26 minutes.
After Nico Frerichs was injured (muscular problems) - Luca Rehberg came in for him - the 4-4-2 went almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, with Niklas Thewes waiting for balls in the front line.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first section.
And opportunities.
But Frerichs before his exit (17th), substitute Luca Rehberg (26th) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed the lead.
It almost took revenge when, in the 41st minute, the SCA hit the Wolbeck box twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbaumer - goalkeeper Damian Hallas proved to be a master of his trade.
After the break, VfL cheekily took full control.
Thewes narrowly missed from 18 meters.
Schroer was also late after 58 minutes when Thewes crossed.
With the substitution of Miles Geske, Fetsch gave the left side a fresh cell treatment.
When Altenrheine&#39;s Chris Naberbaumer fell down Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, the hosts got an indirect free kick 18 meters from the visitors&#39; goal.
The fouled himself started and demonstrated his dangerousness with standards.
Westhues&quot; Ding with the right slipper hit the bottom left from the shooter&#39;s point of view - 1:0 (71st).
20 minutes left, which should be damn long.
And then this: In the 80th minute, VfL captain Florian Quabeck was unlucky to lose the ball in the penalty area.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79th).
Wolbeck had to endure anxious minutes in the final phase before Geske still had the winning goal on the Puschen in the 87th minute from twelve meters.
Might have been too much of a good thing.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Frankfurt wins 4-1 against Hannover 96
Starting position: Four points after five games - that couldn&#39;t be enough for coach Adi Hütter.
Against Hannover 96, Eintracht Frankfurt finally wanted to ensure their first home win.

This means that only 8 percent of the board members were female as of September 1, according to the report &quot;The Power of Monoculture&quot;, which will be officially presented by the Allbright Foundation this Monday and was available to the German Press Agency in advance.
&quot;Companies will have to position themselves differently, otherwise international competitors will overtake them,&quot; said Wiebke Ankersen, managing director of the foundation.
In the USA, Great Britain or Sweden, all-male management teams - with a few exceptions - have long been unthinkable.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, innovation-friendly and future-oriented in comparison.
It&#39;s a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German companies listed on the stock exchange can also be attributed solely to positive impulses in the companies in the index of medium-sized companies (MDax).
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are women.
In the previous year, however, the figure was still 3.8 percent.
In the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion of women has stagnated.
Most recently, 26 women worked on the boards.
&quot;I&#39;m sure that the Dax companies will recruit women more consistently in the coming year - in their own interest,&quot; said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they will continue to make no commitment to increase the share from &quot;zero percent&quot;.
A different picture emerges for the supervisory boards: as of September 1, the proportion of women there was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men fewer than a year ago.
&quot;If the same number of women were recruited for the board each year, the proportion would be 40 percent by 2023,&quot; says the report.
Some even make a mess: Luxury bodies: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari deserves the best.
The Italians take 280,000 euros with each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: This slogan still applies today - in most cases.
Which of the noble providers makes the most profit per car.
Munich – Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers collect per car they sell?
&quot;Autopapst&quot; and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer dealt with this question.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros with each car sold in the first half of the year - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, only makes around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even add a lot to each car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are doing well with prices averaging EUR 33,000 to 38,000 per car and an EBIT of around EUR 3,000.

In July she married Harald Leemann from Zug.
She did not reveal the date of birth.
Torchlight procession at the opening of the 60th Abtswind Wine Festival
The tourist office in Abtswind opened its wine festival session with a torchlight procession.
For the 60th time, the association is organizing the wine festivals, which from now on take place every Saturday in October in the large marquee on Rehweiler Straße.
At the start of the anniversary, those responsible marched through the village to the fairground to the sound of the marching band from Wiesenbronn.
The chairman of the tourism association, Wolfgang Starz, mayor Jürgen Schulz and wine princess Lisa Kursawe welcomed the guests in the already jam-packed marquee. &quot;Doing something like this for 60 years - that&#39;s an amazing achievement for a small town with 800 inhabitants.
You can be proud of that,&quot; Starz thanked all the helpers.
Wine Princess Lisa II later symbolically toasted the guests from the stage.
&quot;It&#39;s nice that so many people have found their way to Abtswind again&quot;. Later, &quot;Die Troglauer&quot; created a good atmosphere.
On the Sunday on which the Abtswinder Kirchweih was also celebrated, the club fixed the drink prices in the afternoon to mark the anniversary, as they had 60 years ago.
A celebratory evening for the 60th wine festival will take place on Friday, October 5, in the guest house, before the second round begins a day later in the marquee.
In Bonn: emergency car crashes into a taxi
An ambulance is badly damaged next to a road.
A 27-year-old woman was fatally injured when the emergency vehicle collided with a taxi.
When emergency doctors are called, they should help - ideally even save lives.
Such a rescue trip ended fatally for a 26-year-old in Bonn.
A 26-year-old pedestrian was fatally injured when an ambulance collided with a taxi in Bonn.
The taxi driver, the emergency doctor and their driver were seriously injured, the police said.
The 46-year-old driver of the ambulance drove through a red light on Saturday afternoon with blue lights and a siren.
He then collided with the taxi going green at an intersection.
After the collision, the doctor&#39;s car crashed into a traffic light pole and a tree.
He caught the passer-by, who died at the scene of the accident.
Ambulance driver and taxi driver seriously injured
The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the ambulance were locked in their vehicles with serious injuries and had to be freed by emergency services.
The 29-year-old emergency doctor, who was also seriously injured, was able to free herself, but she could no longer help the pedestrian.
Another emergency doctor who was summoned tried this - but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
The police are working closely with the Bonn public prosecutor to determine who is to blame for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, Mourinho is uncomfortable
After the embarrassing end in the League Cup, Manchester United is now also losing in the 7th round of the Premier League.
United lost 1-3 to West Ham United. The nature of the defeat should still be something to talk about.
The scene in the 74th minute, in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic scored the 3-1 for West Ham, was emblematic; just three minutes after Marcus Rashford supposedly put the Red Devils back in the game.
Suspecting an offside from Mark Nobel&#39;s pass, all Manchester defenders stood still, giving Arnautovic all the time in the world to fire the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative climax of a previously unsatisfactory performance over long stretches.
The mood at United&#39;s city rivals Manchester City is very different at the moment.
The Citizens, trained by Mourinho&#39;s big rival Pep Guardiola, came to an unchallenged 2-0 win against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke through the underdog&#39;s defense for the first time for the home team.
After a good hour and a one-two with the former goalscorer, Sergio Agüero ensured the sixth win in seven games and thus also the jump to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer top of the table
Three days after losing 2-1 in the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool&#39;s 1-1 draw against Chelsea in the Premier League.
As with the Cup-Aus, the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man in London.
The 27-year-old&#39;s goal in the 25th minute was the only goal of the game until the final stages.
Shaqiri, who came on for Mohamed Salah in the 66th minute, just missed the equalizer after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge did better with his flick in the 89th minute.
After the Reds started the week with an impeccable record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated Jürgen Klopp&#39;s team in the cup, but the draw in the league also knocked the Blues Liverpool down from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) celebrated 2-0 victories.
However, the Gunners fans, for whom Granit Xhaka played through, had to wait until the 81st minute for a message of success against the surprise team from Hertfordshire.
Nine minutes from the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unluckily shot a cross from Alex Iwobi into his own goal, just two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third goal of the season.
Arsenal have overtaken Watford thanks to their fifth win in a row and are now fifth behind great rivals Tottenham. Newly promoted Wolverhampton continue to make a strong impression under their Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
Wolves went 2-0 against Southampton in the league for a fifth consecutive unbeaten run and are 8th.
VW core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show under the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet omnipresent: The diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and retrofitting should not let go of the German car companies at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, starting next week, they will be showing their new products in the French capital, together with competitors from all over the world.
The diesel doesn&#39;t really play a big role anymore.
The possible exchange and retrofitting offers for diesel owners in Germany, which are still to be negotiated with the government in Berlin, should nevertheless be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen Group is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there and have their first purely electric models with them, among other things: the e-tron from Ingolstadt is scheduled to be launched at the end of the year, and the EQC from Stuttgart in 2019.
Both have already been officially presented.
The iNext from BMW is not scheduled to start until 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3 Series.
Altogether more than 250 exhibitors are represented this year from October 4th to 14th.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numerous mobility service and software providers are also present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which is celebrating its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years, alternating with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, a good one million visitors came.
At least 380 people died in the severe earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was shaken by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first tremor had a magnitude of 5.9, the second a magnitude of 7.4.
Communication and transport links were damaged, and there was enormous property damage.
After the tremors, the tsunami hit the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a festival.
It is feared that the number of victims will continue to rise significantly.
So far, the figures have only come from Palu.
Numerous other communities are also affected - along Sulawesi&#39;s west coast.
About 150 bikers celebrate church service in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated the closing service for the motorcyclists in the Friedenskirche in Eveking with a team of helpers on Sunday.
Werdohl – The square in front of the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the closing service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible for the pastoral needs of the powerful two-wheeler riders.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) always takes place on the last Sunday of the month at Haus Nordhelle.
The bikers traditionally celebrate the end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Around 150 bikers came together there on Sunday to celebrate a service that was anything but ordinary.
From 10 a.m. the cars were lined up in front of the entrance portal of the church.
First of all, the biker morning pint was on the program and you could strengthen yourself with coffee and cake or even with a hearty currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, were also there.
The sermon was given by Pastor Dirk Grzegorek during the biker service.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill provided the background music.
&quot;Although the bikers prefer blues rock, Valerie Lill strikes more poetic and calm tones,&quot; says Pastor Frank Schröder.
This was certainly a novelty yesterday in the history of the motorcycle church service.
Füchtorfer Heimatverein celebrates a big party: After the apple comes the milk
And Borisch was also active on the actual day of action.
She provided her hungry guests with freshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused great interest.
He had his apple press with him and demonstrated step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice to his amazed spectators.
Now and then Hartmann-Niemerg let the children do the field and let them fill the apples into the big hopper.
With a little muscle power, the apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not many of the children could imagine how a tasty drink could be made out of it.
But they were also able to watch this important work step on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed into molds and wrapped in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the pieces of apple, which looked a bit like shredded apples, layer by layer on top of each other.
Thanks to a certain amount of technical support, the last step was no longer that difficult.
The freshly squeezed juice gradually ran into a large vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer also had ready-filled specialties with him.
So he opened his &quot;treasure chest&quot; and presented the latest Federweißen to the older visitors.
The demand for the good drop &quot;Made in Füchtorf&quot; was correspondingly high.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents got into conversation, while the children were not only able to follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the bouncy castle for themselves.
Active members of the Füchtorfer camaraderie of former soldiers were also involved in the festival and invited to entertaining games at some stations.
Also in the coming year, the home club will offer a day of action.
However, as Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the Heimathaus in the heart of the asparagus village will not be the scene of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the topic: After all, it will then be about milk.
1: 4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth bankruptcy of the season: &quot;Shitty situation&quot;
Frankfurt/Main After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals from Hannover 96 and encouraged them.
However, there was not much positive to see before the 1: 4 (0: 2) of the bottom of the table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
&quot;It&#39;s a shitty situation, but you have to get out of it as a team,&quot; said 96 soccer pro Pirmin Schwegler, adding: &quot;Of course it&#39;s disappointing, because you always have big plans.&quot;
The still winless Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86th) scored, are at the bottom with two points and are in their current condition a relegation candidate.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt celebrated their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB Cup winner, who after the successful dress rehearsal for moved the Europa League game against Lazio Rome into mid-table with seven points.
Croatia&#39;s vice world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive action by the Hessians in his starting eleven debut and was never able to get a grip on Hanover&#39;s defense.
The striker, who was ailing for a long time after the World Cup, showed with his speed and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
In addition to Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, who was loaned out by FC Liverpool, was in the starting line-up for Frankfurt for the first time, and they started energetically.
A header deflected onto the goal net by Lucas Torró (17th) brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced Kevin Wimmer (back), who was out at short notice.
The lead for the home side fell almost inevitably and was fully deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a corner was saved, Haller headed in front of the goal, where Ndicka only had to put his foot down.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender, who came from French second division club AJ Auxerre in the summer.
And Frankfurt followed suit before the break.
This time Haller passed to his strike partner Rebic, who skilfully fueled through and gave 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time, Hannover coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in two new offensive players in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxony now played a little more courageously forward, but there were no brilliant ideas until shortly before the end, when the goal was scored.
The Hessians were much more efficient.
After just under an hour, Rebic started a solo and then put it across to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was just a show for the overwhelmed guests from Frankfurt, and Jovic also scored a minute before the end.
Morlaixplatz becomes a party mile
Würselen Despite the cool temperatures, there was a good atmosphere at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.

Geisingen: Geisinger Christians celebrate Holy Cross Festival
The Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Holy Cross Festival on September 14th or on the Sunday after.
The festival service takes place in the town church, followed by a procession to the Holy Cross Church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church houses the shot Christ, which dates back to the Thirty Years&#39; War and which, according to legend, was shot at by a Swedish soldier.
Blood then flowed from the gunshot wound.
From this developed a large pilgrimage to the shot Christ, which then also led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This has not been completed to this day, only the chancel is standing, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Pastor Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, consolation and life.
Despite its importance for the parish of Geising, the service was poorly attended.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and the church part of the Cross Festival ended with the final blessing.
For many years, the Catholic church choir has also invited people to the secular part of the festival in the Catholic rectory.
The choir members provided the visitors with hearty dishes and a large selection of cakes and, weather permitting, farm ice cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guided tours around the town church. On behalf of the parish, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors about the damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone work and windows as well as the upcoming construction work, which will continue into the next year will drag on.
After the scaffolding had been in place for some time, the damage could be determined more precisely and the individual tenders could be prepared in more detail.
What is certain is that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damage that already existed a few years ago has increased, but more has also been found, which only became possible after the scaffolding was used to inspect it.
The plastering work on the base has been completed, the natural stone work is to be started before winter and it is hoped that a good half of this work will be completed this year.
Inauguration: New dormitory in Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstrasse.
Everyone present at the inauguration agreed that &quot;a very special house&quot; is now being handed over to its destination on Münsterblickstrasse.
After all, the twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller dormitory for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Architect Rudolf Bader took wider aisles, corridors and doors, larger rooms and barrier-free access for all areas into account in his concept.
The first planning began around eight years ago, when the former US Army officers&#39; building was put to the test for residents with handicaps: &quot;The house was getting old and the equipment was no longer up to date,&quot; Bader explained in retrospect.
In 2016, the excavators came to demolish the house.
According to the architect, the new building should be designed to be as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens a new dormitory
Lebenshilfe invested around 4.6 million euros in the new building.
The Free State contributed 2.4 million euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 euros.
According to the architect Bader, the construction work remained within the planned framework - in terms of both time and money.
The managing director of Lebenshilfe, Jürgen Heinz, also thanked him for this.
The balancing act between a barrier-free and at the same time fireproof construction was not always easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that gave the residents the freedom to move around without outside help.
The head of the social administration of the district of Swabia, Gertrud Kreutmayer, expressed a similar view: &quot;The house is geared towards the special needs of its residents, who need aids to be mobile&quot;.
At the same time, comfort and functionality have been well combined, said Kreutmayer.
And further: &quot;The property in this location is a real stroke of luck because it can no longer be acquired in the current situation&quot;.
All in all, the new dormitory on Münsterblickstraße offers almost 1,500 square meters of space for 30 people with disabilities, who are divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe Managing Director Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed according to collective agreements.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Berlin - Before the day of unity, the deputy SPD federal chairwoman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all compatriots not to put up with the discrimination against East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of unity.
We must not be satisfied with these differences,&quot; said the Prime Minister of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania to the &quot;Tagesspiegel am Sonntag&quot;.
The goal must remain to create the same living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans work longer than people in West Germany on average, but earn 15 percent less.
&quot;Almost 30 years after German unity, I can&#39;t explain that to anyone,&quot; said Schwesig.
North Korea: Will this cute dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hound is supposed to smooth the waters between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has presented South Korean President Moon Jae In with two North Korean Pungsan hunting dogs.
As Moon&#39;s office announced on Sunday, the two approximately one-year-old dogs already reached their recipient on Thursday.
They passed the border town of Panmunjom together with three kilograms of dog food to &quot;make it easier for the animals to get used to it&quot;.
With thick white fur, pointy ears, and brown eyes, the dogs are considered loyal and intelligent.
They belong to the national treasures of the Democratic People&#39;s Republic of Korea.
The north announced the gift of friendship at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and to jointly apply to host the Olympic Games in 2032.
As part of the mutual rapprochement, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri rocket propulsion test facility.
Austria&#39;s eventful history reflected in 99 documents
What is Austria?
To mark the 100th anniversary of the republic, which has been celebrated for almost ten months in this commemorative year, numerous new books have been published, most of which answer this question by looking back at the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and general director of the Austrian State Archives, has a completely different approach in the magnificent &quot;picture book&quot; Austria, which will be published on October 1st.
New week, new chance for government
Back to business - that&#39;s the unofficial motto for the working week of the grand coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not recently invoked the &quot;return to practical work&quot; like a mantra.
That may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other employed citizens in this country to ask the legitimate question of what the difference is between work and technical work, but so be it.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself to its task again - to governing - it should not be prevented from doing so by terminology debates.
Whether the Union and the SPD can actually achieve something together after the provocations and embarrassments of the past few weeks, may already show on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the governing parties meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly in order to defuse conflicts early on; a lesson from all the strife.
First of all, however, with the diesel retrofits and the law on the immigration of skilled workers, conflictual issues are back on the agenda.
CSU Minister of Transport Scheuer wants to let the car companies get off lightly with exchange bonuses, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers as having an obligation to technically retrofit older diesel vehicles.
While there were signs of a rapprochement over the weekend in the diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still far apart when it comes to the planned law on the immigration of skilled workers.
The SPD demands that rejected asylum seekers who work or do an apprenticeship have the prospect of staying.
The Union is strictly against the &quot;lane change&quot; from the asylum system to the labor market.
So there will be arguments again among the coalition partners - and how could it be otherwise?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form GroKo, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.
arguing is good.
A society characterized by so many diverse and sometimes conflicting interests cannot move forward without a fight.
In order to be constructive, however, a dispute must not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons on the question of to be or not to be.
This is still about politics, not about theatre.
Union and SPD should argue - but always keep an eye on the reality of people&#39;s lives.
What is feasible and useful for many?
With this key question, both the diesel and the lane change question can be clarified pragmatically - and thus regain trust.
This is what the mainstream parties have to fight for now.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
minister in sight
Is the Minister of Labor of all people violating the applicable service law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to take a closer look.
An exuberant social affairs minister reported at the presentation two weeks ago that her legislators had been working &quot;really day and night&quot; on the social security reform.
The statement by Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) met with astonishment from list mushroom mandatarin Daniela Holzinger - she is now bringing the matter to parliament via a request.
She assumes &quot;that the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the work of her team and did not want to announce violations of the applicable service law in front of the cameras&quot;.
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to &quot;acquit Hartinger of any suspicion&quot;.
Police tear up a street in search of a woman&#39;s body
Marxgrün – The police did not want to comment on this for a long time.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning there has been digging on the state road between Naila and Bad Steben.
The route is closed in the Marxgrün area until Monday.
The investigators had previously used an archeology dog.
The dog, which was specially trained to smell old human bones, was finally able to narrow down the relevant spot to a few meters together with its handler in repeated use.
In addition, a soil anomaly was discovered in the area of the said stretch of road together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the highest Bavarian monument protection authority.
The public prosecutor&#39;s office and the Hof criminal police have been working on the missing person case for more than a year.
A cycle path near Marxgrün was repeatedly blocked and examined with sonar devices because the investigators suspect that Heike&#39;s body could have been buried here in the course of the construction of the new state road 30 years ago.
Color powder and eggs: Barcelona riots ahead of Catalonia anniversary
Monday marks the first anniversary of Catalonia&#39;s controversial independence referendum.
But even before that, there are riots.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation in autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes broke out between separatists and the police in central Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence supporters, including with powdered paint, when they tried to prevent them from approaching a demonstration by the National Police and Civil Guard.
Around 3,000 officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wanted to hold a rally to honor their colleagues who had worked at the polling stations last year in the referendum that was classified as illegal.
Attempts to prevent citizens from voting also resulted in violence.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to keep the demonstrations by the separatists and the central government security forces separate, Spanish media reported.
Some of the 6,000 or so separatists then tried to break through the police line and threw paint bags and eggs at the officers, among other things.
Six people were arrested and 24 others were slightly injured, the authorities said.
Monday marks the first anniversary of the independence referendum.
After the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid placed Catalonia under receivership in autumn 2017.
The regional president at the time, Carles Puigdemont, fled into exile in Belgium.
Other politicians also fled abroad.
However, several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement are still in custody.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the receivership ended.
But the new regional president, Quim Torra, also insists on the Catalans&#39; &quot;right to self-determination&quot;.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Collected helplessness: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen separate scoreless
Rot-Weiss Ahlen continues to tread water.
Even at FC Gütersloh it was only enough for a 0-0 draw.
In front of 438 spectators in the Heidewald stadium, they turned out to be at the bottom and third from last as a collective helplessness.
The first half was very manageable in terms of entertainment.
Anyone who would rather get a beer or a bratwurst could do so without any worries.
There was no danger of missing a scoring opportunity because there were practically none.
First shot after half an hour
Gütersloh&#39;s Nick Flock was responsible for the first (harmless) shot on goal of the entire game in the 28th minute.
The Ahleners had the best - and in principle the only real - opportunity when Cihan Yilmaz forced FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling to make a save after 32 minutes with a shot from the edge of the penalty area.
The hosts were even more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, Sinan Aygün came on for him.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the increasing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel aimed just over the goal from 18 meters and after an hour the Güterslohers made their first offensive appearance.
After Matthäus Wieckowicz won the ball, things went quickly.
Nick Flock (62&#39;) &quot;crowned&quot; Sinan Aygün&#39;s quick counterattack with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also followed up with a header from Wieckowicz (66&#39;) after a corner kick from ex-Ahlener Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut reacted, first bringing in Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60th) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Mützel (70th).
It did - nothing.
Thanks to their own initiative, the people from Ahlen could not achieve more than visual superiority.
Cihan Yilmaz only had the last chance in the 91st minute, but that didn&#39;t yield anything either.
Angelo Daut then tried to emphasize the positive: &quot;I like that we kept a clean sheet&quot;. But unfortunately the zero was also in front.
&quot;This time we weren&#39;t as dangerous as we were against Holzwickede, even though our opponent didn&#39;t want to play here,&quot; said RW Ahlen&#39;s interim coach.
Offensively &quot;everything splashed a bit&quot; against a team &quot;that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn&#39;t have the feeling that we could concede a goal,&quot; said Daut.
To his chagrin, the spectators didn&#39;t get the feeling that his team could score a goal.
The idea was too poor for that.
Reckenfelder Thanksgiving market: Luckily there are enough Kreimers
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Tafel issue point, for whom these donations are intended, are delighted.
The volunteers assure: &quot;These donations remain in Reckenfeld&quot;.
At the opening, the sky was bright blue, but the square was still a bit empty, but that should change in the course of the day.
Because: &quot;It&#39;s so sociable here, that&#39;s why we&#39;re here today,&quot; said one visitor.
The organizer of the festival, Franz Josef Holthaus, welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit with a healthy pinch of humour, as always.
Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stepped in at short notice for the Brockmanns, who were actually supposed to be weighed against food.
Verena (Ferdi Kreimer&#39;s daughter) has fallen ill.
But there are enough Kreimers.
And the &quot;substitute&quot; insisted on entertaining the ever-increasing number of visitors with music.
It was so well received that some folk songs were sung along late at night.
&quot;Just great,&quot; said a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in his schedule this time.
He is happy about the many active people with their stands, most of them clubs.
&quot;Actually, there shouldn&#39;t be such a thing as a table,&quot; he said, thanking him for the action of the men&#39;s choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of everyone who worked at the stands and also included the other festivals that took place in September and the &quot;clean up&quot; campaign.
Our garden city gives itself a colorful coat of paint - something is happening here.
Then Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück took down the May wreath with the help of the fire brigade and took it to the winter quarters.
At many stands people worked for the physical well-being.
Everything from sweet to savory was available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, got creative with his scroll saw.
He had veneer work, beer mats with Reckenfeld motifs and a lot more on offer.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a speciality: &quot;Reckenfeld honey&quot;, brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlueter.
The latter has another speciality.
Honey cake in a jar, of course with honey from my own production.
Little Elsa had to eat it again and again, the cake tasted so good.
It is the conviviality that made the visitors linger long into the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Smearing with a local political message: Not a successful advertisement for a skate park
In Lengerich, strangers advertised the construction of a skate park in a hardly beneficial way.
There are corresponding graffiti in several places, says Jürgen Kohne from the city administration at the request of the WN.
In at least one case, criminal charges of property damage have been filed with the police.
The three words &quot;Skatepark for Lengerich!&quot; are emblazoned in large letters on signs at the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among other places.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that after the career fair on September 19th, a corresponding lettering was discovered on the advertising sign on the stairs to the Gempt bistro.
Since the short message was apparently &quot;only&quot; left with an Edding at the time, it could have been removed without any problems.
&quot;A few days later it was there again, this time sprayed on,&quot; says Rottmann.
He assumes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
This case in particular gets a special touch from the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are named on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization should also be made possible by sponsors.
There have already been commitments, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the municipal school, sports and culture department, without naming names.
However, it is quite possible that one or more of the sponsors are identical to the companies that are on the smeared board.
Local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate parks for years.
After the old one at the LWL Clinic had been dismantled, the search for an alternative location began after some time.
In the end, the majority of the council voted in favor of the fire brigade car park.
However, this request was not implemented - too many factors apparently spoke against building at this point.
A turnaround followed at the end of June.
The members of the main and finance committees voted unanimously in favor of the Gutenberg School site.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The city council has the final say.
He assumes a decision will be made this year, so that if the vote is positive, construction could start in 2019.
Air traffic control bottleneck is getting worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of an improvement in the coming year.
&quot;This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm will come,&quot; said the head of the air traffic control union, Matthias Maas, of the German Press Agency before the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
An important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known shortage of staff at European air traffic control, for which there is no quick solution.
&quot;The airlines and the airports can make quick improvements for the coming year, but it takes four to five years to train new controllers,&quot; said the trade unionist.
Across Europe, the market for fully trained pilots has been emptied.
In the Karlsruhe center alone, around a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the federal government, the federal states, air traffic control, the airlines and the airports will meet in the Hanseatic city on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
&quot;If you want to talk about additional work intensification and overtime, that won&#39;t work without us,&quot; explained the head of the GdF, which has many members in the federal German air traffic control service.
Maas again blamed the guidelines of the EU Commission for the pilot misery.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period running until 2019 were far too low.
The resulting cost specifications and personnel savings at the national air traffic control services are now fully reflected in the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to work in Brussels for regulations that &quot;do not further cut off the air traffic control&quot;.
The EU requirements are currently being coordinated until 2024 and further tightening is to be feared.
The EU is exposed to constant lobby pressure from the airlines.
&quot;Ryanair boss Michael O&#39;Leary and his colleagues are now reaping exactly what they have sown in recent years,&quot; said Maas.
He hopes that the high delay costs will prompt airlines to rethink.
The GdF will only help to improve the situation if the German air traffic control (DFS) offers a &quot;coherent training and future pact&quot;, said Maas.
The previously announced intake of 120 pilot students per year over the next five years is just enough to compensate for the age-related departures.
The necessary increase in personnel is not yet associated with this.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for corporate restructuring
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board have voted unanimously in favor of the plans to restructure the company.
According to the will of Thyssenkrupp interim boss Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed CEO at the meeting on Sunday, the troubled group is to be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are said to be based in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There should not be any additional staff cuts beyond the already known cuts in administration.
After two resignations, the supervisory body on the capital side only has eight members.
On the other hand, there are ten employee representatives.
However, the final decision is expected to be made at a general meeting in 2020.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG will include, among other things, the 50 percent share from the merged steel business with Indian partner Tata.
In the second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, the business with elevators and supplies is to be bundled.
Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police officers and Catalan pro-independence supporters.
Violent clashes broke out in two simultaneous demonstrations by Spanish police officers and Catalan pro-independence supporters in Barcelona, leaving many injured.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police tried to keep the two protest trains away from each other with a large contingent.
According to the emergency services, pro-independence advocates tried repeatedly to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and projectiles.
According to the information, there were also scuffles between the participants in the various protest trains.
According to rescue workers, 24 people were injured.
The police said there were six arrests.
Better salaries and appreciation of colleagues
With their demonstration, the police officers wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who, almost exactly a year ago, had taken action against the independence referendum in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
At the same time, they demanded better salaries.
Members of the Spanish police and Guardia Civil find it unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn significantly more than they do.
The demonstrators felt it was a provocation that the Spanish policemen were demonstrating in Barcelona of all places.
&quot;Why did you come here to protest?&quot; 55-year-old Catalan protester Manel Perez asked the AFP news agency.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they beat us up a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to give his name as Daniel, rejected the accusation.
&quot;Of course we want to support our comrades who only did their duty last year: defending the law,&quot; he said.
But the demonstration is there to assert our rights and we do it in Barcelona because it&#39;s a big European city and there&#39;s more of an echo here.
But he and his colleagues &quot;didn&#39;t come to provoke,&quot; assured the police officer.
Panne allowed access to personal data of British ministers
A vulnerability in a mobile app meant that the personal details of ministers and MPs from Britain&#39;s Conservative Tory party were temporarily accessible to everyone on Saturday.
According to British media reports, several ministers received calls from strangers after the breakdown became known a day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people trapped on B217
On Sunday morning, the Hanover police reported a serious traffic accident on federal highway 217, Hamelner Chaussee, on the outskirts of Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died when their car crashed into a tree.
The car is currently on fire.
The emergency services are on site.

Football: Juve coach praises after the top game: Ronaldo&#39;s best game
The Portuguese star striker &quot;played the best game that evening together with the half hour from Valencia&quot;, praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champions&#39; 3-1 (1-1) victory over SSC Napoli.
For the trainer, the expensively bought star was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuer even without a goal of his own.
&quot;Ronaldo had a lot of fun and is doing well,&quot; said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good with our first goal - and from that moment we grew.
Thanks to Ronaldo&#39;s three assists, Juve turned the game around after falling behind early on with a goal from Dries Mertens (10th minute) and initially left their closest pursuer behind.
The goalscorer brought in by Real Madrid initially put the ball on former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who gave the lead with a brace (26th/49th).
And after a corner, Ronaldo also did the preparatory work for defender Leonardo Bonucci&#39;s goal (76th), who only had to push in just before the goal line.
&quot;He gives a lot of assists,&quot; said the coach.
But Allegri naturally also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalscorer in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
&quot;We have to get better at serving him,&quot; said the coach.
Mandzukic is currently the top scorer for Juve with four goals - Ronaldo has three.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus&#39; superiority seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven wins in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champions of the past seven years are already six points ahead of Napoli.
The second in the table, trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without a chance against Turin.
But at the latest when Mario Rui (58th), who had already been warned, was sent off, the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to leave the field with yellow-red after a too hard challenge against Paulo Dybala.
&quot;We played well against a good Napoli,&quot; commented the Turin coach.
Emre Can should also feel addressed.
The German national player has prevailed at Juve.
The professional, who came from Liverpool FC, was in action in all seven league games.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which Allegri meant by the &quot;half hour&quot;: Ronaldo was sent off in Turin&#39;s 2-0 win and is suspended for Tuesday&#39;s home game against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West is changing his name
Rapper Kanye West attracted attention with a particularly bizarre performance on the US TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; at the weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused frowns and question marks among the audience.
The 41-year-old also announced a name change just in time for the release of his new album.
From now on you can only call him &quot;Ye&quot;, so the musician.
&quot;The creature formerly known as Kanye West,&quot; he tweeted, echoing the late singer Prince when he dropped his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is nothing new.
The tenth album was released under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL, the artist explained that &quot;Ye&quot; has a religious meaning for him.
&quot;I think &#39;Ye&#39; is the most used word in the Bible and it means &#39;you&#39; there,&quot; the rapper said.
Football: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
Done!
Hoetmar&#39;s coach Averhage made no secret of his disappointment.
That was a weak game from us today.
The opponent simply had more grip, we hardly ever presented him with any problems&quot;. The list of Hoetmar&#39;s scoring opportunities reads correspondingly thin.
Just two chances to score in 90 minutes, so games can rarely be made positive.
Football district league A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two chances in the first round, but Maik Krause used the first from a tight angle to take the lead early (7th).
Steffen Uphus could have increased in the 43rd minute, but after great preliminary work from Krause he frittered away free-standing.
The hosts only had a double chance when first Moritz Höne failed to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the margin Jan Blome also found his master in the sending Horster keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49th), Julian Turl (61st) and Heinz Linnemann (69th) all missed.
A hand penalty - Louis Kortenjann saved with his hand on the goal line and saw a red card - was also not used by Niklas Eilmann for the guests (75&#39;).
The game was only decided when Nils Berheide poked the ball over the line (81&#39;).
&quot;We had criticized each other hard before, that was different today than in the last few weeks,&quot; was Florian Kraus&#39; conclusion.
Send Horst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90th Leibig), Turl.
Goals: 0: 1 Krause (7th), 0: 2 Berheide (81st).
Red card: Kortenjann (75th / Hoetmar).
Football: district league A2 Münster: spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia 3:4
&quot;I don&#39;t know what to think of that,&quot; he struggled for words.
&quot;We didn&#39;t even get access to them.&quot; By that he probably meant the wingers with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but also all the other green-whites who stood out with a collective offensive urge.
He was still able to laugh: &quot;A dirty win,&quot; he said, gave a cheeky wink and walked away. His players, on the other hand, were relieved that they had gotten out of the affair with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, is playing for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting to stay up in the league.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA trainer Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes that lay behind him.
&quot;That was by far our best performance of the season,&quot; he says.
&quot;The way we come back after going 2-0 down, how we hold up against one of the top teams in the league throughout the season, that was really phenomenal.&quot;
It is all the more bitter that you now have to go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner gave the hosts the lead with his 12th goal of the season (24th).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
He made it 2-0 on the left in an exemplary manner for Fabian Fröhning (39&#39;).
We knew that, but you can&#39;t take a player like that out completely.
&quot;It was amazing what he did,&quot; Lewandowski ungrudgingly acknowledged the opponent&#39;s quality.
Shortly before the break, his own team equalized: McGill&#39;s free kick from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal (45&#39;).
After the change of sides it was McGill again who scored the equalizer (59th).
After that it went back and forth.
It was a tight, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten again (64th), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized (69th).
Despite being outnumbered, Albersloh was no longer able to counter the last Concordia goal (80th minute).
We now have to focus our full attention on Wednesday.
&quot;The game against Schapdetten is what we have to win now,&quot; said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87. Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87. Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (24th), 2-0 Fröhning (39th), 2-1 McGill (45th), 2-2 McGill (59th), 3-2 Nübel (64th), 3-3 P. Horstmann (69th), 4: 3 Jülkenbeck (80th).
Yellow-Red: Atalan (74./Albachten).
Soccer: TSV Straßberg fights point against Primus
There was no winner in the state league duel between TSV Straßberg and FV Biberach.
The league leaders had actually come for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0-0.
Media: The entire presidency of Dynamo Dresden resigned
According to media reports, the entire executive committee of second division soccer club Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
In the evening, several media unanimously referred to a joint letter from the Saxon committee.
There was no immediate confirmation from the club.
The reason for the withdrawal should be internal power struggles at the former Bundesliga club.
Erdogan in Germany: politics instead of pomp
Glad he&#39;s gone again.
There are only a few state guests whose departure from Germany brings as much relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The Turkish President was a guest in Berlin and Cologne for three days, and many thought he shouldn&#39;t have been invited at all.
Evangelische Akademie Tutzing: Prominent guests and new offers
The Evangelische Akademie Tutzing will be offering around 80 conferences by the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize personally in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President, he was not in Tutzing&#39;s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after Wulff was a guest there.
That&#39;s how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him when he said proudly: &quot;All the Federal Presidents and Chancellors have already been with us&quot;. The fact that celebrities keep appearing at the academy in Tutzing Castle was also an issue when the annual program was presented.
At the end of October, singer-songwriter Konstantin Wecker will take part in a conference on spiritual experience from a philosophical perspective, and on September 29 the writer Frido Mann will be at a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
In the meantime, French President Emmanuel Macron has also agreed: He wants to personally receive the &quot;Tolerance Prize&quot; awarded to him by the Academy in Tutzing, which TV presenter Dunja Hayali also receives in a different category (we reported).
The around 80 conferences until mid-2019 are quite a challenge.
&quot;The pension is not safe!&quot; is in a conference title.
&quot;SOS at Europe&#39;s borders&quot; - this is how the academy describes the &quot;risky and deadly route across the Mediterranean&quot;.
&quot;And to a conference on Syria: &quot;Barbarism without Limits&quot;.
Arms deals, destruction, torture, death - war makes a mockery of every humane idea&quot;.
The spectrum ranges from structural racism in society and the gap between rich and poor to the radical change in work through digitization.
Academy director Hahn was convinced: &quot;A free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to look for solutions or at least partial solutions&quot;.
At a conference marking the 200th
Karl Marx&#39;s birthday soon, some expect more visitors who criticize capitalism, while others expect a tendency &quot;from left to center&quot;.
What about neutrality?
&quot;We are 100 percent a subsidiary of the Evangelical Church,&quot; said Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, &quot;so we are not 100 percent neutral&quot;.
Music cabaret: gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
&quot;Suitable for adults as well as for men&quot; was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the hall of the Christ Church in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret tester, Teubner tackled gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth for the (felt) woman and the (felt) man and whatever else there might be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
Ben Süverkrüp sat on the wing.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who occasionally has his say until the end of the movement, and on the other hand, a true pianist: Süverkrüp Teubner accompanies so harmoniously that some may have wished for a solo.
There was that too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but in a different way, namely in a way that matched the central theme of the evening.
Teubner brought a paradox into play: a man&#39;s satisfaction comes when he has a partner, but she doesn&#39;t open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same thing: what would have happened to Mozart&#39;s composition if &quot;the Nannerl&quot; had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp glides over in improvisations, from Bach&#39;s &quot;O Head full of blood and wounds&quot; into the &quot;Song of Death&quot;, and from Mozart&#39;s G minor symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and &quot;Bravo&quot; from the full hall.
Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, presented flowers to the chansonette.
But the chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not want to miss an additional thank you.
She had the idea of treating the duo to one in Wolbeck in addition to performances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

The background is Musk&#39;s surprising announcement in August that he wanted to take Tesla private.
In its lawsuit, the SEC accused Musk of making false and misleading statements.
Bruchsal.
After a bus accident on the A5 in Baden-Württemberg, the police corrected the number of victims slightly downwards.
10 instead of 15 passengers were slightly injured.
All have since been discharged from the hospital.
The French bus driver stayed in the hospital overnight for observation.
A police spokesman said he would be released later today.
The cause of the accident on the long-distance bus near Bruchsal is still unclear.
The long-distance bus crashed head-on into a crash barrier on Saturday morning.
Handball: Women&#39;s national league: Ahlener SG keeps the clean sheet against TV Wattenscheid
The women from Ahlen mainly had problems with the third division player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals alone.
&quot;Actually I was happy with the defense, only one player scored too many goals.
We couldn&#39;t get it under control,&quot; said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more annoyed by the many missed opportunities.
His team missed the concentration in the end this time.
The ASG therefore ran behind almost until the end, trailing by 11:12 at the break and later by 15:18 (45 th ).
It was only towards the end that the wider bank of the hosts made itself felt.
In addition, Aydogdu put Merle Klement on the left winger, who then &quot;scored the decisive goals extremely cleverly&quot; (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek , Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd league women: top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd league west.
The blue-whites won 3-1 at VC Allbau Essen, which was relegated to the second division.
&quot;It was a giant step for a cool season.
It makes Lenz to play in the upper third of the league.
We&#39;ve worked hard for that,&quot; said coach Dominik Münch after an almost flawless performance by his team against the fallen table leader.
The guests dominated the first round almost at will.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went 25:15 to the vice champion of the previous year.
Essen accepted in a two-bar, but didn&#39;t come into play.
We&#39;ve kept them busy.
Our opponent served at high risk, but also produced a number of tickets.
In the second set, BSV was already leading 12:8. &quot;Essen has switched acceptance to three-bars.
We couldn&#39;t hold the serve pressure.
Food got sucked in and we let ourselves be lulled a bit,&quot; Münch continued.
At 18:17, the volleyball players from the Ruhr area were ahead for the first time.
Although Ostbevern fended off four set balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
&quot;The game was now a class better,&quot; said the trainer to the increasing level.
With their serves, Maike Rüdingloh and finally Wiebke Silge made a significant contribution to BSV turning the tide in the third period from 14:16 to 25:21.
Münch: &quot;We played consistently and calmly&quot;.
7:3 and 15:13 brought the blue and white round four to their side with 25:22.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an excellent day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish community: Mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the manner in which Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan inaugurated the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
&quot;The opening of the mosque in Cologne left a pile of shards in German-Turkish relations that can only be swept together with great effort,&quot; said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and the German side missed the chance to make a joint, conciliatory appearance.
&quot;Instead of emphasizing that Muslims belong to Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the date for his purposes,&quot; Sofuoglu complained.
The extensive exclusion of the German public &quot;reinforced many reservations&quot;.
Heimatverein Nottuln: Offer has already established itself
After the long summer break, it&#39;s finally Folktreff time again.
On October 18 (Thursday) at 7:30 p.m., the Nottuln local history association is holding its fifth Nottulner folk gathering in the fireplace room of the Alte Amtmannei.
It&#39;s almost a year to the day since we held a folk meeting for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,&quot; says Hanns Moormann, chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have thought that our folk club would establish itself in Nottuln so quickly.
Whether it was a storm Friederike in January or a heat wave in July, the office&#39;s fireplace room was always full.
&quot;As always, the program at the next folk get-together is a colorful mixture of German folk, hiking and sea shanty songs, folk songs, evergreens and old hits,&quot; says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who keeps inviting fellow musicians to Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has agreed to attend the first Folktreff &quot;birthday&quot; with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of &quot;Gaitling&quot;, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt that played music with Low German lyrics.
Now he&#39;s touring with an Irish folk band.
The organizers of the Folktreff like to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the Folktreff Emsdetten delighted the audience with his international version of the song &quot;Froeches in the Night&quot; and sent them home with a catchy tune.
&quot;We are expecting many happy guests to spend another sociable and humorous evening,&quot; says the invitation from the local history association.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to get actively involved is invited to participate.
Since the coveted seats are always occupied quickly, it is advisable to be there early enough.
The Folktreff begins at 7:30 p.m., but admission is at 7 p.m.
China approves proposed merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24th.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair take another step forward on the way to becoming the world&#39;s largest industrial gases group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde announced on Sunday.
This means that the approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest hurdle - in the USA are still pending for the multi-billion dollar merger.
According to an insider, the chances of approval there had recently improved because Linde had promised to sell additional parts of the company.
For legal reasons, all open questions must be clarified by October 24 for the merger to succeed.
From pure fruit growing to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the District Association for Horticulture and Land Conservation was celebrated with a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29, 1893, a fruit show in the Kulmbach club house provided the final impetus for founding the Kulmbach district association for horticulture and conservation, and exactly 125 years later it celebrated a big anniversary on Saturday evening in the Kulmbach town hall.
Of course, it had a different name back then: Mayor Wilhelm Flessa launched it in 1893 as the &quot;District Fruit Growers&#39; Association Kulmbach Stadt und Land&quot;.
The purpose of the fruit-growers&#39; association also differed from today&#39;s work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
&quot;At that time, in the epoch of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite,&quot; explained district home keeper Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees should line trunk roads, so-called industrial gardens were created near schools.
Fruit growing is still the task of the 55 horticultural associations in the district of Kulmbach, which have almost 7,000 members.
But the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Gardening that is close to nature, biological plant protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as imparting knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth group &quot;Moles&quot; showed in an entertaining way on stage how diverse the areas of responsibility of a horticultural association are.
&quot;Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age,&quot; said district chairman Günter Reif, and Mayor Henry Schramm also emphasized how important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect as much joy with smartphones and the like.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with District Administrator Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
&quot;The district association decides where they should be,&quot; added District Administrator Söllner, emphasizing the special importance of the horticultural associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
District manager and consultant Friedhelm Haun left no doubt that this is a real concern of the many horticultural associations in the district.
He led the many visitors through the long history of the district association with a slide show and reported, among other things, on the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Everything used to come from the garden, it was canned for the winter.
At the end of the 1950s, however, the vegetable garden was transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
&quot;Nature endures, it was there before us and we have to use it as a guide,&quot; pleaded the fruit and nut tree specialist.
That is why there is an incentive for the horticultural associations not to let up so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living in.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the President of the Bavarian State Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
&quot;We have to stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe that to our children and grandchildren,&quot; concluded Günter Reif at the successful ceremony, which was solemnly framed by the tower horns of the Musikverein Thurnau.

Priority to Nafta talks: Canada&#39;s foreign minister postpones UN speech
Mexico&#39;s government wants clarity on NAFTA: They are giving both trading partners an ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada&#39;s foreign minister is now giving the trade agreement top priority - and is postponing her speech to the United Nations.
Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate in New York because of the time pressure in the struggle for a new edition of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the USA and Mexico.
Her spokesman Adam Austen announced that instead of speaking on Saturday, the minister would not speak before the United Nations General Assembly until Monday.
In the meantime she is concentrating on the renegotiation of NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators from Canada and the US had 48 hours to come to an agreement if Canada actually wanted to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the US.
In August, the USA and Mexico agreed on a revision of the regional free trade agreement NAFTA.
US President Donald Trump hinted that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Talks about a new edition have been going on for over a year.
They should now be completed by Sunday evening (local time), Trump&#39;s government wants to submit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1st.
Mexico&#39;s President-elect Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada should the negotiations fail.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonaro
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
According to a report in the daily newspaper &quot;O Globo&quot;, the far-right ex-military man wanted to fly to Río de Janeiro, where he lives.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will make public appearances in the last week before the presidential elections in the South American country.
The politician was attacked on the street during a campaign event in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people took to the streets in several Brazilian cities to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title &quot;Ele não&quot; (in German: &quot;He&#39;s not&quot;), women&#39;s associations in particular had called for protests against the ex-military.
The associations also mobilized against Bolsonaro&#39;s racist and misogynistic statements on social networks.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in the economic metropolis of São Paulo.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the Brazilian Workers&#39; Party (PT) presidential candidate, Fernando Haddad.
He replaced ex-president Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run for office.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7th.
As the ex-mayor of the city of São Paulo, Haddad has so far lagged far behind the right-wing extremist candidate Bolsonaro in polls.
The &quot;Trump of Brazil&quot; has been involved in politics for a long time, but has recently presented itself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates achieves an absolute majority in the first round of voting, there will be a runoff on October 28th.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not emerge from this successfully - no matter who he competes against.
Bolsonaro is known for inciting anti-gay and anti-black propaganda and glorifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
Again and again he shocks with verbal gaffes.
Another time he said supporters of Lula&#39;s left-wing Labor Party should be shot.
Europe reclaims Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, on the outskirts of Paris, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale.
In front of more than 150,000 spectators over the three days at Le Golf National, captain Thomas Björn&#39;s underdog team dethroned the favored defending champions USA with great shots and outstanding team spirit around a toothless Tiger Woods.
After a long illness: Danish rock legend died
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsen&#39;s website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children on his deathbed.
The musician had been treated for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became known with the band Gasolin&#39;, which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Their songs were influenced by international music greats such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the band broke up in 1978, Larsen found success as a solo artist.
He sold around three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album &quot;Midt om natten&quot; is the best-selling album in Denmark to date.
In a statement on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen as a &quot;street boy&quot; who &quot;was against everything, but in all hearts&quot;.
The head of government also recalled that the opponent of the monarchy, Larsen, appeared in 2010 at the 70th birthday of Danish Queen Margrethe II.
Rock night in the shoe factory: volume at jackhammer level
&quot;Here we stand, take the bone saw and ignite a concert evening with the power of a tiger&quot;. The band names &quot;Here We Stand&quot;, &quot;Tiger Bonesaw&quot; and &quot;The Ignition&quot; alone suggest such a description of the rocking live music experience on Saturday evening in the hall of the Schuhfabrik community center: pure hard rock from three bands who are friends with each other.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
No trace of stage fright.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency &quot;Mosquito&quot; from Oelde - and their bands visibly delight the around 120 visitors to the &quot;Mint Mosquito&quot; rock night.
Even the quartet &quot;Tiger Bonesaw&quot; with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from their own pen and the soon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, people dance to the harmonious and powerful interplay of the band.
Although calls for &quot;encores&quot; cannot be ignored, &quot;Tiger Bonesaw&quot; then leave the stage to the trio &quot;Here We Stand&quot;.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate that not all hard rock is created equal with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic 1970s rock.
After the &quot;High Energy Rock&quot; of the &quot;Tigers&quot;, &quot;Here We Stand&quot; uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar rock.
Not only the longing, almost ballad-like &quot;Take Me Home&quot; impresses with the change from melodic passages to the guitar-heavy rock riffs of the complex songs.
The quartet &quot;The Ignition&quot; from Tönnishäuschen has since its founding in 2005 gained a special reputation.
Full of agility, the band presents their hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that &quot;The Ignition&quot; has special stage experience with its performances in front of a very large audience - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 tour in China.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in interaction with the band, also sets his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, &quot;Word Up&quot; by Cameo from the 80s.
In the meantime, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers an acclaimed solo to the sound, which feels even higher than before, while walking through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of such a hard rock concert, depending on the genre: according to the mixing desk team, at the &quot;Mint Mosquito&quot; rock night this is the case for the three-piece concert of &quot;Here We Stand&quot;, &quot;Tiger Bonesaw&quot; and &quot;The Ignition&quot; at around 98 decibels.
That&#39;s about on the level of a jackhammer, but is still well below the levels of the &quot;Wacken Festival&quot; that &quot;The Ignition&quot; refer to on their website.
However, the Ahlen audience doesn&#39;t need the deafening 120 decibels in high-speed gear drive volume that is common at the annual metal rendezvous in the north of the republic at this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the harder, rocking gait have long since convinced with their sovereign, virtuoso playing and their own compositions.
&quot;Here we are, took the bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the power of a tiger&quot;, all three groups can say at the end, figuratively of course.
And above all enjoy the great applause of the visitors.

One dead in a glider accident at Essen/Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim/Essen Airport.
A glider crashed in a parking lot at Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
The pilot died in the accident.
A fatal accident occurred near Mülheim/Essen Airport on Sunday.
As the &quot;Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot; reports, a glider crashed in the exhibition center car park at the airport.
The pilot died as a result.
As the &quot;WAZ&quot; further reports, the flight student was alone on board - the plane is said to be a single-seater.
At the time of the accident, the aircraft was already approaching for landing.
The crash site is not far from a marquee on the airport grounds.
But since this weekend an Oktoberfest has been taking place.
Mülheim/Essen Airport is on the city limits of the two cities in the Ruhr area and right on the access road to the A52 motorway.
There is a Park&amp;Ride offer from the car park for large events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump adores Kim: &quot;And then we fell in love&quot;
It&#39;s no secret that US President North Korea&#39;s ruler Kim is well disposed despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump has made a real declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim&#39;s &quot;beautiful letters&quot;.
At the tender age of 72, the married US President has embraced a new flame.
The tragedy is that it&#39;s a long-distance relationship.
In public, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un on Saturday.
In front of supporters in the US state of West Virginia, Trump found almost tender words for the half-year-old scion of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although he is proving to be a very tough chunk in the struggle for North Korea&#39;s nuclear disarmament.
&quot;I was tough, so was he, and it went back and forth between us,&quot; Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
OK?
No really.
And it wasn&#39;t just the conversations with Kim that melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, great letters.
Their personal connection has also borne fruit politically: Trump referred to the halt to all nuclear and missile tests announced by Kim, even if critics have so far seen little more than lip service behind it.
The US President seemed to be well aware that the affection for the &quot;Rocket Man&quot; - Trump&#39;s nickname for Kim - who is notorious for his martial threats.
In any case, he anticipated the expected criticism when he appeared in a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: &quot;Donald Trump says they have fallen in love&quot;.
How awful, how awful is that?
This is so unpresidential.
But he doesn&#39;t care that much, Trump explained, and then pointed his index finger at the crowd: &quot;I&#39;ve always told you it&#39;s so easy to be presidential.&quot;
But then there would not be 10,000 people crowding into this packed arena, we would only have 200 people standing outside.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Baesweiler Very well attended, full of atmosphere and, on top of that, spoiled by the sun: Baesweiler&#39;s city center dressed up very varied and with a good dash of Oktoberfest flair on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest didn&#39;t just take place in the marquee at the fire brigade tower, but was extended to the city center by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees have used a cell phone video to draw attention to their catastrophic prison conditions in Libya, thus making their rescue possible.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Saviya in July, risking their lives, and distributed it online.
&quot;They refuse to send us back,&quot; said one man in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the France 24 Observers website, whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were finally flown to Nigeria at the end of August.
&quot;We probably wouldn&#39;t have been able to return to Nigeria without the video,&quot; Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to cross the Mediterranean to Europe.
According to his own statement, the video put his life in danger.
One of his comrades-in-arms was nearly beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the prison conditions were catastrophic: &quot;They all hit us with pipes and sticks.&quot;
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrine.
The IOM organizes the voluntary repatriation of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent home through the program this year, said IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo.
The case of the Nigerians who have now been rescued is not unusual in view of the poor prison conditions in Libya.
So far, however, he has not heard of a call for help via mobile phone video.
International organizations have long criticized the conditions in the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African state, which is largely controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local elementary school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her lessons for Monday, she surprised a burglar.
At around 4:50 p.m., the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the vestibule on the first floor, she saw a man who fled immediately.
First through a door, then over the roof terrace and from there over a staircase to the ground floor or the forecourt.
The teacher called the police, who began investigating.
Whether things or money were stolen cannot yet be said.
Perpetrator description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, somewhat dark appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please send information to the Obernberg am Inn Police Inspectorate, telephone number 059 133 4244.
Deutscher was trapped in his own car for days
A 75-year-old had to stay in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in Central Franconia after he had stuck the car off any forest path and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers accidentally discovered the car near a pasture on Saturday afternoon and freed the person who had been missing since Tuesday evening, the police said on Sunday.
According to the information, the 75-year-old from Pleinfeld was in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He stated that he is now looking forward to his home.
The pensioner was reported missing by his family after he failed to return from a drive in his 4x4 through local meadows and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intensive searches, the whereabouts of the man remained unclear for days.
Laschet warns of the rule of law in Türkiye
Cologne North Rhine-Westphalia Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) said he had called for the rule of law in Turkey in conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Relations between the two countries are currently &quot;overshadowed,&quot; said Laschet on Saturday after meeting Erdogan at Cologne Airport.
This applies above all to waves of arrests, freedom of the press and freedom of religion.
He therefore &quot;made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite&quot;.
According to Laschet, he also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He had formulated the expectation that freedom of expression would be respected.
Erdogan then again emphasized the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to a building of the Federal Ministry of Defense&#39;s flight readiness department at Cologne Airport.
It was originally supposed to take place at Wahn Castle - but the owners of the castle had rejected this out of political conviction against Erdogan.
After the conversation, Erdogan traveled to the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had canceled a joint appearance in the building.
But he said: &quot;The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country&quot;.
And we are also their contacts - and not the Turkish President.
Lack of trust in the US: North Korea demands disarmament
While US President Trump never tires of emphasizing the success of the negotiations on North Korea&#39;s denuclearization, the East Asian regime presents the situation in a more sober manner.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for concessions from Washington.
At the UN general debate, North Korea&#39;s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho accused the US government of blocking negotiations for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula with its continued sanctions.
&quot;The recent deadlock comes as the US relies on coercive measures that are deadly for confidence-building,&quot; Ri said in New York.
Under these circumstances, disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea.
&quot;Without any confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can be the first to disarm ourselves,&quot; the North Korean chief diplomat said.
That punitive measures could &quot;bring North Korea to its knees&quot; is &quot;a dream come true for people who don&#39;t know us.&quot;
However, in order to build trust, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, the minister criticized that there had been no &quot;corresponding reactions&quot; from the US side.
Because of North Korea&#39;s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year alone.
US President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged the United Nations to strictly comply with the punitive measures.
At the same time, the US government is working on a rapprochement.
Trump met North Korea&#39;s ruler Kim Jong Un for the first time in June.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US President is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
In October, Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang again for talks on ending North Korea&#39;s nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
The many visitors to the HoT open house were unaware that they were actually in a youth club: White blankets and floral decorations on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
The youngsters of the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new kitchen.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the young people wanted to say thank you with the food.
Getting started with the new facility wasn&#39;t exactly easy, as Henriette Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our fridges with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then came the nasty surprise on the first day after the summer break: A power failure put the huge, two-part refrigerator out of order, the food was spoiled and had to be thrown away.
&quot;Now we had to start all over again: We received a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it on their own,&quot; says Westbuer.
And so everyone pitched in.
The result was impressive, the guests were delighted.
&quot;Cooks can&#39;t do better than that either,&quot; praised an impressed visitor while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served or the guests were allowed to help themselves to quiche, meat loaf or cake.
&quot;It&#39;s really great what the children and young people have accomplished,&quot; emphasized Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen caused astonishment with card tricks and other tricks.
Jürgen Sator is leaving the NRW state board of the Tafel
Out of frustration about criticism from his own ranks, the boss of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has given up his post in the state association.
Sartor became known nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a freeze on admissions for foreigners.
Sartor told the &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; that he had already resigned as deputy head of the NRW panels in July.
I&#39;ve had too many stabs in the back.
The head of the North Rhine-Westphalia Food Association, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed his understanding for the decision of his long-time deputy to the dpa.
Sartor took the harsh criticism with him.
&quot;I can understand his step - people said they didn&#39;t know exactly why the Essener Tafel was doing it.&quot;
But Sartor is still active for the Essener Tafel - &quot;six days a week, nothing will change there,&quot; says Weilerswist.
In the &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; Sartor again criticized criticism of colleagues from other panels.
One shouldn&#39;t take the approach that &quot;without us, the people in the city would starve.&quot;
It is the duty of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
The Essen resident did not take part in a congress of the Tafel on Friday in Berlin.
&quot;I&#39;m being told too much sweet cuddles,&quot; he said.
There are all these social fuzzies who also criticized me at the time.
SF Lorch gambled away the 2-0 lead – Gmünder Tagespost
Football, district league Lorch loses against Neuler 2:3 - TV Heuchlingen wins in Kirchheim after a deficit - Bettringen clearly beats Lauchheim.
Lorch was already 2:0 in the home game against TV Neuler - in the end it was 2:3 and the disappointment among sports fans was great.
The TV Heuchlingen was completely different: In Kirchheim, the TVH quickly fell behind 0:1, but won 2:1 after 90 minutes. At the top of the table, the SGB could meanwhile with a 3:0
Gladbach gambled away twice the lead - Schalke without Embolo with their first win
Borussia Mönchengladbach will have to wait for an away win in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2, the foals lost a lead twice.
Schalke gets their first win of the season against Mainz (1-0).
(sda) Schalke have maneuvered themselves offside four times in the first five league games with early goals conceded.
Now Domenico Tedesco&#39;s team has once again shown the strength with which it took first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf gave the home team the lead in the eleventh minute after strong preliminary work from Yevgeny Konoplyanka, and the hosts then preserved the mini-cushion with a compact defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greets them again from the top of the Bundesliga.
Lucien Favre&#39;s team was 2-0 down at half-time against Bayer Leverkusen, but still managed to win 4-2 in the second half.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65&#39;) and Marco Reus (69&#39;) equalized with a double within four minutes, Paco Alcacer, who came on from Favre in the 63rd minute, caused another double in the closing stages (86&#39;/ 94.) for the culmination of the performance increase after the break.
VfB Stuttgart also achieved their first victory.
In the meantime, Stuttgart had to worry about Werder Bremen, who were already decimated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in own goal that helped the visitors equalize in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led VfB to their first win.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang experienced neither a completely successful nor an unsuccessful debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbach team, who lined up with the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, gave up the lead twice, ultimately played 2-2 and have been waiting for an away win in the VW city since 2003.
Renato Steffen was responsible for Wolfsburg&#39;s equalizer to make it 1-1 with his second Bundesliga goal.
Yann Sommer was powerless when the Aargauer shot low from 20 meters, as was the second goal after an hour.
Nevertheless, the trends at Gladbach are quite promising.
Alassane Pléa is increasingly proving to be a goal-getter in the Foals&#39; attack.
Against Wolfsburg, the French record buy from OGC Nice scored for the third time in a row and for the seventh time in seven competitive games.
After seven rounds, Gladbach is in 4th place.
Within 40 minutes, the previously unbeaten Werder Bremen maneuvered themselves into an uncomfortable position against VfB Stuttgart.
After 19 minutes, Florian Kohlfeldt&#39;s team let themselves be surprised by a Stuttgart counterattack, which ex-Luganesi Anastasios Donis completed with his first goal of the season, after 36 minutes Milos Veljkovic continued to attack his team: the 23-year-old Serb conceded after a jersey pluck Daniel Didavi Yellow-Red.
Although Stuttgart&#39;s defender Borna Sosa and goalie Ron-Robert Zieler brought Bremen back into play with a curious throw-in own goal (68th), Gonzalo Castro shot the Stuttgart, who were outnumbered, back onto the Siegesstrasse fifteen minutes before the end.
Nürnberg decided the duel against Dusseldorf 3:0 in their favor.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course with a foul penalty.
Macedonians vote on new state name
In Macedonia, around 1.8 million citizens are voting today on whether to change their country&#39;s name to North Macedonia.
If yes, the conflict with neighboring Greece that has been smoldering for almost three decades could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its eponymous northern province and blocked any advance of Macedonia towards the West.
The voters therefore also decide on future integration with the West.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member if the referendum were positive.
Syrians in custody.
Refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally beat three pensioners, injuring them some seriously.
The 41-year-old asylum seeker rioted on Friday around 10 p.m. in the escape lane in Alsergrund.
When the police arrived, they spoke to the accused, who attacked passers-by with clenched fists and tried to attack them, about his behavior.
The Syrian then tried to punch and kick the officers.
A little later it turned out that the suspect had just hit three older women (65, 67, 75) with his fists on the Währinger Strasse at a tram stop.
He had also kicked the trio with his feet.
Some of the pensioners were seriously injured.
They suffered bruises, bruises and concussions.
The asylum seeker was also seriously injured &quot;for reasons that are still unknown,&quot; according to the police.
He was taken to the hospital and monitored throughout the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Almost exactly a year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper.
&quot;If we marry, then properly&quot;. He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on opening up marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir on June 30, 2017 with an angry speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having &quot;stumbled&quot; on the subject.
&quot;That was your Schabowski moment,&quot; he said, referring to Günter Schabowski&#39;s accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right to adopt.
Garden day: 400 meter hedge trimmed
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the children&#39;s home civic association and the society for leprosy.
Because around 400 meters of hedge around the gardens of the residents of the prebendary house should be cut.
Supported by the residents, around twelve supporters got to work.
&quot;We&#39;re doing this to reduce costs,&quot; said the chairman of the citizens&#39; association, Walter Schröer.
And a lot has accumulated.
We&#39;re late this time due to the hot summer, but luckily it&#39;s just a topiary now.
Because the hedge had already been sheared in the spring.
The breakfast that always follows work also has a long tradition.
&quot;Everyone should stay strong,&quot; said Walter Schröer.
World Championships in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Canoe Slalom World Championships
Augsburg&#39;s Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the canoe slalom world championships in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old put in a perfect run on the Olympic course on Sunday.
Two years ago he had missed Olympic bronze by three hundredths of a second.
I was well prepared, I&#39;ve had enough rides here on the facility and everything went well today,&quot; said the Olympic bronze medalist in London 2012.
At the finish, he threw his paddle away with joy and raised both arms in the air, confident of victory - knowing full well that it would at least be enough for a medal.
After all, he had start number four.
But the six remaining starters couldn&#39;t top his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
The Czech Jiri Prskavec finished second ahead of the Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police station reports the first attempted break-in this autumn in a single-family home.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter - burglars want to take advantage of that.
The Gauting police station reported yesterday the first attempted break-in this fall.
It is thanks to the alarm system that the attempt at the single-family home on Königswieser Strasse was successful.
It started when the perpetrators lent a hand shortly before 8 p.m. on Friday.
The burglars suspected that the residents were not at home.
Apparently, the alarm system surprised them so much that they fled without taking anything.
Notes to the PI Gauting, telephone (089) 8 93 13 30.
Bankruptcy at Hertha: caught up with reality: Bayern against Ajax demanded
The predicate unbeatable is gone: FC Bayern &quot;doesn&#39;t want to put up with&quot; the defeat in Berlin.
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim conclusion for Niko Kovac&#39;s tenure.
The first small dip in performance under the new coach Niko Kovac should not increase to a larger autumnal low for the Munich team.
&quot;A week ago you still had the impression that we were invincible.
Now reality has caught up with us a bit,&quot; said Thomas Müller after the deserved 2-0 defeat at Hertha BSC and demanded a reaction for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us knows that this really annoys us and that&#39;s why we&#39;re stepping on the gas towards Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year, they did not score their own goal away from home, as at the same time last season, two competitive games in a row without a win, the table lead in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund for the time being.
The overall situation is by no means as dramatic as it was in the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the record champions must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with their intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners with their playful pinpricks over the wings have provided two blueprints within three days of how Bayern, who recently appeared overpowered, can be cracked.
&quot;Those who know FC Bayern know that we won&#39;t put up with it and that we will do everything we can to be successful again,&quot; emphasized Kovac.
Otherwise, however, he was surprisingly gentle with his losers in his native city and simply blamed his first defeat as Munich coach on the renewed lack of opportunities.
A win against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday before the international break would mean that the first interim result of his tenure would be positive - otherwise the tone is likely to get tougher.
Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second premier class appearance of the season after the 2-0 win at Benfica Lisbon.
After the day off on Sunday, the short preparation for the second preliminary round match against Ajax begins as planned, who had also defeated AEK Athens 3-0 at the start.
&quot;We&#39;ve been hit in two games now, but we&#39;ll score our goals again,&quot; announced national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, Joshua Kimmich in particular spoke plainly.
The right-back appeared in the role of reminder.
&quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s all bad luck, we have to work hard for it because we didn&#39;t take the multitude of chances and made mistakes at the back,&quot; emphasized the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic Stadium.
On the seventh day of last season, Bayern were five points behind Dortmund, who have now taken the lead again with a one-point lead.
And so, with a wink, Kimmich rated it at least positively that the public debate about the supposedly unbeatable Bavarians has now come to an end.
&quot;Yes, that&#39;s good,&quot; said the international.
It&#39;s good for the league.
DFB boss in the line of fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack by Erdogan on Grindel
With serious allegations, the Turkish President Erdogan denounces the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the association&#39;s line.
Now a new post is to be created.
Berlin – Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for the sovereignty of interpretation in the permanent disputed topic Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish President heavily criticized the handling of the ex-world champion in Germany at the opening of the large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the DFB boss defended the association&#39;s line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, who was personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause in the ZDF &quot;Sportstudio&quot; in Mainz.
&quot;In the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-teams - we have to draw very precise conclusions that something like this won&#39;t happen again,&quot; said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as an additional integration officer.
At the same time, Grindel stated again that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
He had sharply denounced racism towards Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our German born and raised Mesut Özil and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they had their picture taken with me in England,&quot; Erdogan said on Saturday in the cathedral city.
To be honest, as its president, I couldn&#39;t stomach the fact that our two young men, who made it into the German national team, were sidelined.
Grindel referred to Gündogan&#39;s statement that, unlike Özil, after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan, Gündogan felt &quot;treated reasonably by the DFB&quot;.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to put himself in front of players in the future.
For someone to say: If I win, I&#39;m German, if I lose, I&#39;m a migrant - that&#39;s not possible.
&quot;I very much regret that he has such an impression,&quot; said Grindel.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said that.
But he doesn&#39;t see a basis for Özil&#39;s return to the national team either.
As a result, an additional integration officer is now to be appointed in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who has family roots in Cameroon.
&quot;If someone without a migration background has a clear impact on society and football and says: &#39;The issue is important, we have to take care of it&#39;, that would also be an initiative to create a better basis for our local clubs, where integration has to work,&quot; said Grindel.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office of DFB President in the coming year.
&quot;I do my job and I try to do it as well as I can,&quot; Grindel said.
Year-old builds three accidents within three hours
Coburg/Rödental – As reported by the police, the 75-year-old caused the accident between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. on Friday.
First, the 75-year-old driver was approached by a lady at the red traffic light in the Lautererhöhe area.
She informed the pensioner that he had hit her car.
However, there was no personal exchange because the 75-year-old could no longer find the lady in the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone report about a motorist who had veered off the road and hit a delineator.
When asked about this, the man did not want the police to be there and then drove away.
Then the Rödentaler drove home.
However, the pensioner lost his way in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and rammed a construction vehicle when turning.
Eventually the police found him and stopped him.
His car had significant accident damage.
The 75-year-old made a confused impression and could no longer remember many things.
The damage is around 1300 euros.
Moor fire in Meppen: Almost 1000 emergency services are still in action.
Around four weeks after the moor fire broke out on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 emergency services are still busy with the extinguishing work.
The Bundeswehr announced this on Sunday.
According to a spokesman, since the situation continues to develop in a stable manner, 70 volunteers were recently withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of emergency services is planned, it said.
An above-ground fire was discovered and extinguished on Sunday night.
The disaster that had been declared a week earlier on September 21 was lifted last week because it was feared that the flames would endanger neighboring forests and settlements due to wind and flying sparks.
On Thursday it was said that the fire no longer threatened to spread to neighboring communities.
At times, more than 1,500 emergency services tried to get the major fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work on the Bundeswehr test site near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
According to the Bundeswehr, reconnaissance flights with &quot;Tornadoes&quot; are planned for October 2nd and 5th.
The fire was caused by test rockets fired by Airbus technicians.
At times, the plume of smoke from the moor fire stretched up to a hundred kilometers across north-west Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr wants to set up a contact point that will receive damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hoteliers and holiday home owners.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his friend
Johannes Kahrs (SPD, r) and his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church of St. Catherine in Hamburg after their wedding.
Almost exactly a year after the marriage for everyone came into effect, the politician married his longtime friend in Hamburg.
The two have been a couple for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost exactly a year after the marriage for all came into force, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his longtime friend Christoph Rohde.
The two said yes on Saturday in Hamburg.
A registered civil partnership was out of the question for her, Kahrs had previously told the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper.
If we get married, then right.
He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is the budget spokesman for the SPD parliamentary group in the Bundestag and one of the spokesmen for the Seeheimer Kreis, the conservative wing of the SPD.
In the Bundestag debate on opening up marriage to homosexuals, Kahrs caused a stir on June 30, 2017 with an angry speech.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having &quot;stumbled&quot; on the subject.
&quot;That was your Schabowski moment,&quot; he said, referring to Günter Schabowski&#39;s accidental announcement of the opening of the GDR border.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had been able to register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, for example in the right to adopt.
Referendum started in Macedonia on new state name
In Macedonia, the eagerly awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan country has begun.
Around 1.8 million voters are to decide whether their state should be called North Macedonia in the future.
Neighbor Greece insists on this because of its northern province of the same name.
As a means of exerting pressure, Athens had blocked any rapprochement between Skopje and the EU and NATO for almost three decades.
If the citizens vote yes, they are also giving the go-ahead for their country&#39;s integration into the West.
Elie Wiesel - The author who saved the Shoah from oblivion
Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel would have turned 90 on September 30.
The 1986 Nobel Peace Prize winner died in the USA in 2016, leaving behind a work that preserved the horrors of the Shoah for posterity.
Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The register is intended to facilitate organ donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed with express consent.
(dpa) Switzerland is starting an electronic register for organ donors this Monday.
This should make organ donation easier and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who want to donate their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be called up by Swisstransplant if necessary.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new procedure does not change the fact that organs can only be removed - as in Germany - only with express consent.
It is assumed that 15 percent of the Swiss have a donor card, says Franz Immer, Director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of the cases will a card be found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In over 60 percent of the conversations, the relatives do not know what the deceased wanted.
&quot;You then have to make a decision on behalf of the deceased, which is often very stressful,&quot; says Immer.
A similar registration system already exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, there are considerations about storing information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as the spokeswoman for the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert, says.
&quot;There is no register in which people can enter their wishes - for or against organ donation,&quot; she says.
Federal Minister of Health Jens Spahn has spoken out in favor of a new regulation of organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would initially be considered an organ donor, unless they or relatives objected.
Among other things, the Catholic Church rejects this.
14-year-old student is world champion in mental arithmetic
14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is world champion in mental arithmetic.
He prevailed against 39 competitors at the weekend in Wolfsburg.
This was announced by Martina Flamme-Jasper from the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest World Cup participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as chief referee Ralf Laue said.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
Previous tasks were for example: 14,130 214 x 17,981,822 or 57,809,355 + 28 x 16,448,333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon in which participants competed against guests from the audience with calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he keeps a ball in the air with his head when doing arithmetic.
He is one of seven Germans in the competition.
A total of 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
Grüß was there two years ago when he was 14 in Bielefeld.
Organizer Laue has little use for terms such as mastermind, genius or child prodigy.
&quot;Mental arithmetic can be trained,&quot; he said.
Many participants practiced for several hours a day.
In India and Singapore there are even arithmetic competitions organized in stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, taking the square root of six-digit numbers.
In versatility arithmetic, the candidates are given surprise tasks for which they must quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans also have good chances here, said the main referee.
Otherwise, Asians are often at an advantage because mental arithmetic is learned there more intensively and with other, effective methods in early childhood.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It&#39;s about early breast cancer detection
Tennis ace Serena Williams shows her soulful and sensitive side.
With this video, the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and campaign for early detection.
It&#39;s about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings The Divinyls&#39; song &#39;I Touch Myself&#39; topless with only her hands covering her most intimate parts.
Singer Chrissy Amphlett died from it.
The emotional video is part of the &quot;I Touch Myself&quot; project, which is about breast cancer screening that can save lives.
Serena Williams nearly died herself a year ago.
There were complications with the birth of her daughter Alexis Olympia.
Emergency surgery was instituted to save the baby&#39;s life.
A subsequent CT scan revealed blood clots in Serena&#39;s lungs.
Just in time...
Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
Vienna - The federal government is planning a significant expansion of the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the turquoise-blue coalition will submit a corresponding draft law for the so-called &quot;Symbols Act&quot; for assessment.
This is intended to significantly expand the number of terrorist groups or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings fresh snow on the mountains in the west
Mother Holle will shake out her beds for the first time in the west next week: polar cold air will reach Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow line at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters at high intensity, they said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohe Tauern, 20 to 40 centimeters of fresh snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
On higher mountain pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bielerhöhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) the road conditions are wintry.
Farmers are allowed to start annual grooming on Monday
Schleswig-Holstein&#39;s farmers are allowed to start with the annual grooming on Monday.
The &quot;green ramparts&quot;, which are unique in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the sparsely forested federal state for around 200 years.
The hedges of trees and undergrowth, which are up to five meters wide, are &quot;forest substitutes&quot; and the last retreat for many animals and plants.
Knicks connect scattered habitats as corridors through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the managing director of the German Nature Conservation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were created on the basis of an order from the Danish king Christian VI. in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The &quot;living fences&quot; were not only field boundaries and cattle fences, they also supplied the farmers with firewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
Its name &quot;Knick&quot; also comes from that time: By &quot;buckling&quot; the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometers of hedges stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and give the picture of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to NABU, they are now used by around 7,000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
Up to 1800 different species could live in one kilometer bend and up to 30 pairs of birds could breed.
However, the kink can only fulfill its ecologically important function if it is properly cared for in winter.
Otherwise it withers to a sparse row of trees, which, in addition to biodiversity, also loses its wind protection effect, said Ludwichowski.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, grooming may only be practiced outside the breeding season from October to March.
After tsunami on Sulawesi Indonesian talks about local situation
In an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND), local Radika Pinto describes the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquake and tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes happened, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I found out about the tsunami, I immediately made my way back to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I still had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight because the airport on Palu was closed at the time.
How is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid supplies can also be flown in.
When I arrived I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our &quot;World Vision&quot; office was also destroyed, but we set up a makeshift place where we also housed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi staying now?
Many have run to surrounding hills where they are still holding out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake and where they have no access to water or food.
Some are staying in front of their houses, there are still aftershocks.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, some people steal food and petrol.
The civil service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison was also destroyed, some of the prisoners are walking around freely and it is difficult to search for them.
There are still many bodies lying around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How does communication and information supply work on the island?
At the moment we have mobile phone reception, but it didn&#39;t work before and we only got information over the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people whom they do not know if they are alive or where they are because people were not at home during the earthquake but were away at work, for example.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about this?
We don&#39;t know why, but when the all-clear came, many thought, &quot;Okay, no tsunami&quot; - and then it did.
In other regions not hit by the tsunami, there was misinformation that a tsunami was hitting the region and they ran to the surrounding mountains.
Isn&#39;t an island like Sulawesi, which lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, prepared for earthquakes?
Yes, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to react to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure collapsed, the earthquake hit a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB have to do without Aogo and Donis for a long time
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo will miss VfB Stuttgart for a long time with serious muscle injuries.
Aogo tore a muscle fiber in the back of his left thigh in the 2-1 win over Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga club announced on Sunday.
Doctors diagnosed Donis with a torn muscle bundle in his thigh.
Both players are definitely not an option against Hannover 96 on Saturday and will probably still miss games after the following international break.
VfB Stuttgart did not give a forecast for downtime.
A muscle bundle tear usually heals within six to eight weeks, a muscle fiber tear usually heals a little faster.
Triumph of Hyperrealism at the San Sebástian Film Festival
San Sebastián - The annual San Sebastián Film Festival closes the ranks of the most prestigious European festivals.
Despite all the swansongs to the cinema, it can be summed up: 2018 was a remarkable year for film.
After a convincing competition in Cannes, above all with strong entries from Europe and Asia and a Venice that was able to attract a lot of attention with Oscar candidates from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning, the Olching fire department tried to catch an injured duck.
However, the action dragged on for some time.
Even a boat was used.
Olching – Walkers on Lake Olching noticed a white, injured duck on Sunday morning.
She stayed in the area of the lifeguard station.
To help the animal, the passers-by called the police and the fire brigade.
However, the first attempts to capture the duck went wrong.
Despite the injury, she was able to dodge the emergency services again and again.
In the end she escaped to the lake.
With a lifeboat, the fire brigade was able to surround the animal and force it back onto land, where it was then put into a transport box by a firefighter with a courageous grip almost an hour later.
The duck, whose chest was injured, was then taken to the LMU veterinary clinic in Oberschleißheim.
But according to the first estimates, their chances of survival are rather slim.
Biathlete Julian Eberhard is aiming for a World Cup medal
Fourth place at the Olympics was in biathlete Julian Eberhard&#39;s stomach for a long time.
Next winter, the man from Saalfelden wants to catch up on the missed medal at the World Championships in Östersund.
The last shot in the Olympic sprint in Pyeongchang cost the 31-year-old a medal that was within reach.
In the end, bronze was missing by seven tenths of a second.
&quot;I deliberately took my time to process it,&quot; says Eberhard at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
The goal was a medal, I was in top form, but it just didn&#39;t want to happen.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to catch up on the missing precious metal in the new season: &quot;The goal can only be to come back to a major event in good shape, to win something.
At some point you have to strike.
The World Championship cross-country ski trail in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard&#39;s: &quot;I&#39;ve fallen in love with the track,&quot; he recalls with joy, remembering his fourth World Cup place in the individual race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only individual victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the mass start competition in Kontiolahti (FIN).
He finished second in the relay in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation at high speed
Time is extremely short and the number of planned interrogations is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at high speed, the Republicans in the US Senate want to secure a wafer-thin majority for judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is controversial because of allegations of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators until Friday to investigate the alleged incidents more than 30 years ago.
The latest turn in the drama about Kavanaugh&#39;s appointment, which was accompanied by a culture war, was triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing between Kavanaugh and First Prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the attorney ranted angry tirades against opposition Democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee was set to clear the way for the arch-conservative Supreme Court Justice&#39;s final confirmation.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when Senator Jeff Flake suddenly declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree but would demand an FBI investigation.
After tumultuous scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described the serious allegations as &quot;crappy&quot; on Thursday, initially refrained from further attacks against the women and, on the contrary, spoke of &quot;luck in disguise&quot;.
In this way, last doubts could be dispelled, he said.
Later, at an election rally, Trump sharply attacked the Democrats for rejecting Kavanaugh: &quot;They are trying to block and destroy&quot;.
Trump orders FBI probe into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also severely limited investigators&#39; powers.
A government official told the Wall Street Journal that &quot;they are not going on a fishing trip.&quot;
According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, only four witnesses are to be heard.
According to the municipality, the mobile radar device installed in a &quot;civil vehicle&quot; by the municipality of Ried to monitor the speed limit will be stationed on Gartenstraße from Monday, October 1st.
The federal school center is also located there.
The municipality also operates several permanently installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after beating Mainz: You could feel the fear
Coach Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated their first win of the season against Mainz.
The relief at Schalke is great after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, the time factor also played a role against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist at football games.
It was no different in the home game against Mainz 05.
&quot;I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area,&quot; said Schalke 04&#39;s sporting director - and breathed a sigh of relief.
In the end, the Royal Blues still managed to tie the narrow 1-0 win over Rheinhessen over time and thus wrap up their first win of the season.
In fact, it could have turned out differently.
After the lead by Alessandro Schöpf 11th gave the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco security Tedesco: &quot;All in all, the first half was good, both playfully and in terms of pressing&quot;, the head obviously played more and more of a role as the game went on.
Actually create no header monster
&quot;The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me,&quot; Heidel said. &quot;If the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that.&quot;
The boys were afraid of letting that go and therefore withdrew further and further.
And defended with man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three points of the season.
&quot;We all took a huge load off our hearts,&quot; said Schöpf, who had a significant part in that with his header: &quot;I&#39;m actually the worst header in the team.&quot;
But in the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including Tedesco, of course.
&quot;We wanted to start powerfully in the early stages and turn it into fireworks,&quot; said Schalke&#39;s head coach.
The win was important.
Finally we can look forward to a few hours.
I&#39;m very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle games over 90 minutes
Probably the biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: Royal Blue failed to worry about clearer conditions.
The chances were finally there, for example through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
&quot;Then it wouldn&#39;t have been a resounding victory,&quot; said Tedesco: &quot;You could feel the fear a bit&quot;.
So I&#39;m glad we won.
He wasn&#39;t the only Schalke player.
Fischbachau: column of smoke in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was unmistakable.
From around two kilometers away, a hiker in the Leitzachtal observed a fire around 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau – The police and fire brigade soon found out the cause: an unknown person had set fire to garbage in a two-square-meter area on Gschwendner Berg.
According to police, it appeared he had been monitoring the fire for a long time but then left the embers unattended.
And that near the forest.
30 Fischbachauer firefighters were busy pulling apart and extinguishing.
Police are now investigating arson.
Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
In front of them is the author, Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani.
Once again he accepted the invitation from Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
&quot;I&#39;ve made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven for many years,&quot; explains the founder and chairman of the &quot;Reckenfelder Treff&quot; - the association that cooperates with the &quot;Cultural Policy&quot; alliance in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani gets into the reading very casually, describes the writing process of the book, talks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in an understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflictual topics: migration and integration.
Why do conflicts increasingly arise despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the question.
German society sits at one table, with first-generation migrants sitting next to each other.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants was born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to have a say.
That leads to conflicts.
It is therefore not decisive whether you are politically right or left, but: &quot;Am I for or against an open society?&quot; he emphasizes.
At first rather cautious, but then more and more lively, the discussion round started.
And there is a need to speak.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in the students.
El-Mafaalani is in front, not on the stage, a symbol of the discussion: she is at eye level.
The sociology professor does not impose his opinion, emphasizing that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the topic, because &quot;we can only find solutions when we understand what the problem is,&quot; says El-Mafaalani.
During the book signing that followed, he still had an open ear for guests&#39; questions, and there was also intensive discussion in the foyer over prepared Kurdish specialties.

This is how Schalke&#39;s Naldo succeeds in &quot;great sport&quot; on the bench
Not in the starting XI for the third time in a row: Naldo thanks Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco nonetheless.
Gelsenkirchen – After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues had not been in the Schalke starting eleven for the third time in a row, but was on the substitute bench, many people would have understood when the almost two-meter-tall Brazilian really talked his frustration off his chest had.
But when the Schalke players gathered in the middle circle as usual after the 1-0 win over FSV Mainz 05 and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone calls Naldo for the sake of simplicity, intervened and said ; &quot;We have to thank, coaches!&quot;
&quot;It was very emotional, it was great sport,&quot; said Tedesco later about the reaction of his vice-captain, who, despite being a reservist again, had no grudges.
Naldo, who was celebrated as Schalke&#39;s best last season, probably knows that he hasn&#39;t actually been sidetracked by his coach - but is being given a break for good reasons.
A reason called &quot;load control&quot;.
It wasn&#39;t easy telling him that
&quot;It wasn&#39;t easy to tell him that, I&#39;ll tell you that honestly,&quot; said Tedesco of the moment he told Naldo that he wasn&#39;t in the starting XI.
He&#39;s an important player, he&#39;s an important person.
But it&#39;s always about the matter, it&#39;s about the club,&quot; Tedesco explained the step.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can take a breather at the moment.
And that we keep everyone on board,&quot; Tedesco explained the rotation, which also recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted with the wisdom of his advanced age: by proving himself to be an exemplary team player on the bench too.
In August, the mood in Austria&#39;s industry accelerated its descent compared to the euro zone.
The Purchasing Managers&#39; Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Austria still has the third-best mood in Europe behind Ireland and the Netherlands, according to the Markit Institute on Monday in its survey of 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, the PMI in the euro zone rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, but the index is still below the 50-point mark, which indicates growth, for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ireland&#39;s industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The Greeks brought up the rear (42.1 points).
The mood barometer fell in Germany, France and Spain, but more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest level since March.
&quot;The slightly weakened descent could mean that the worst is over,&quot; said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
But industry remains the number one brake on growth - at least in the third quarter.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro zone have fallen more than they have since November 2011.
The companies therefore cut jobs for the seventh month in a row.
In China, too, industrial production fell more sharply in August than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the previous month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers&#39; Index bases its figures on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, the developments in sales, employment, inventories and prices are recorded.
