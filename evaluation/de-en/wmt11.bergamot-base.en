What is she supposed to do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague do not know Voldemort or the "Confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation at all.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz once "knocked off" members of the new council from the ČSSD a little, as they mastered the notorious slang, which has become naturalized in recent years, in which today's coalition partners in Prague were at the helm.
The coded vocabulary introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era of Lord Mayor Pavel Bém is borrowed from some of the best-known actors, situations and causae.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils were somewhat in the dark regarding these new terms.
At least that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
But councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also responded in a similar way.
For example, on the term "golfhole."
“That’s the only expression of those you’re presenting to me here that I use every now and then.”
“Otherwise, I don’t think much of slang.”
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the ODS election congress, the editorial staff picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "largest Prague golf hole," "go to the pastry shop," "taper-neck," "betrayal of the capital" and "flailing."
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised his participation in the conversation first, but then did not even take the listener off.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
“I don’t care about these things and how the middle-class Democrats talk to each other, I don’t judge that.”
"For me, it's important how we understand each other as part of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the headline mentioned above allegedly did not recognize that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the ex-mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he correctly guessed at the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added: "But I know that more from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'll probably have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the Councillor for Environmental Issues Lukáš Plachý as a tunnel Blanka.
However, both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant," Plachý is pretty close to the mystery of the solution when you know that this is the seat of Janoušek's companies.
In agreement with Březina, however, he asserts that he has drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
Judging by the test participants, there actually seems to be no similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
“I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there really isn’t anything like that with us.”
"We call ourselves by name, every now and then we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party comrades.
"At school I was called Bříza (Birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and lo and behold - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly for the party comrades the "grandpa" or less friendly the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections by massaging in party sponsorships, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are thus the only one that the Social Democrats allow in intra-party language.
Hulínský supposedly doesn't like it when he's called "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz still registered another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname "Doctor of Rubberstick Rights" allegedly has to do with Petr Hulínský earning his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are stamped in Burkina Faso to witches usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they can't find work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
When one of these women "becomes" a witch, she becomes strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
“Men are rarely affected by this fate.”
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with the work and give birth to children," a religious sister describes the situation, which in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home takes care of more than one hundred women who have been ejected from their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason, issued a brochure intended to prevent the "witch persecution".
The matter has a catch, though.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper derStandard pointed out to the dilemma of written enlightenment.
However, being accused of witchcraft is also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighbouring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they doused her with petroleum and simply set her on fire.
This incident was also reported by the BBC server.
However, the perpetrators claimed that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is flared, which is used for ritual anointings.
After the group tried to "drive out an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" support people here without regard to their education.
"Der Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human souls are a danger earlier and today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president has involved the president himself in the past year.
“President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly played a part in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself by black magic.”
"To do this, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, indiscriminately abducted women and men from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," the organization Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with a hallucinogenic effect, which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the people arrested did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of the international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless pays higher rent
An elderly subordinate man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for the own and the apartments of his daughters and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three were made within the framework of the so-called. "Deregulation" is just raising the rent.
Instead of 3500 crowns of monthly rent, the son is to raise 4100 crowns next year for a 2-bedroom apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running hot water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he tips with his finger on the new lease of the son, to whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-out of tune and half-resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rent conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants simply not to sign the new contracts and until the 7th. Waiting in December, where she intends to publish a guide on how to take action against such contracts.
But the man just waves it off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a sinister face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes a large "deregulation laboratory".
After New Year's Day, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-oriented rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine in the morning this Tuesday breakingly full.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with her a call device.
"Rent 2011", so a special touch panel on the touchscreen lights up.
Briefly tapped and the device spits out a license plate.
No sooner have we deciphered the number "157" and already beeps it on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later, it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes with the new leases in the region of Ostrava will flutter into the mailboxes of most of the tenants of the 44,000 apartments of the RPG's portfolio.
The RPG Byty beats them in the letters a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 percent before.
The special counter for the new rents at the client center has been since the 18th. November open.
"The action is going on a little over a week, that is, this is just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment's hesitation, as the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and Bakala's former miner's apartments are an explosive issue.
Before the elections, the Parliamentary Vice-President Lubomír Zaorálek from the ČSSD had taken up this issue quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
“Twenty years I want a new floor from them.”
"Not even a besch. Toilet glasses could change them," the man mentioned at the beginning makes himself air.
Until now, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the counter to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rent reduction, which promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time.
Other tenants who will receive the new lease by 15 are also to benefit from a half-reduced February rent. Sign December.
Until now, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded by demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here because of," the counter officials estimate.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on its websites as well as wall panels, where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but is to be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center, at least in part, agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which 5,000 remain for me for food, where should I take the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr. Zaorálek tells them about the media not to sign and so people are still waiting," she said.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic at New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the agitated tenants is, in the opinion of the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rents raised between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is said to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few bright red information appears again and again in between.
“The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG’s apartments.”
"Always this means a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter per month," reads the LCD monitor.
Only 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio increase the rent by 38 percent.
"These cases are about raising extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," RPG argues.
With 2600 apartments, the rent will remain at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that deregulation will not skyrocket rents, but will be gradual within four and eight years.
What's more - the company imposes another obligation: All revenues from the rent increase (see chart) the company wants to put back into the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation.
But - primarily these should benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw a - the office also includes a kindergarten
The Avriopoint office building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to Arch.Design staff since last year.
The project planning and architectural office Arch.Design, from whose studios a whole series of well-known Brno buildings come, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for its company mini kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are in the baby boom age and the company is concerned that the project architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Together with the opportunity to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer to its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers and architects thus have it easier to balance their demanding profession and child care.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management, they managed to win funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company mini kindergarten is financed by the Operational Programme Human Resources and Employment Policy from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants of 2, 8 million CZK) the necessary facilities and equipment could be procured and for a period of 2 years for qualified personnel and operation are provided.
After the use of the subsidies (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the mini kindergarten for 3 more years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a full year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the settlement of applications.
The children are cared for by all-day qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can visit children without age-related restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children may be present at the same time, but the day over several children alternate with each other.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in relation to the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and nursing, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting program of preschool education.
The children not only play here, above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic knowledge to preschool lessons, by the way they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a calculator available to the children.
What more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can take a look at the children at any time and so the stress when picking up the children late from a distant kindergarten is eliminated.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
Arch.Design thus joined the Czech companies, which offer significant benefits in recruiting new employees, which are family-friendly and encourage their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house still fascinates even after 100 years. Take a look at the interiors of Gaudi
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are torn fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic shapes was nicknamed "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile shards and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of sheds and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features for the Art Nouveau style of Antonio Gaudi.
The façade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures that are reminiscent of nature and living things.
Only on closer inspection do you notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well-thought-out order.
At night, the whole façade looks even more plastic, more dramatic and the special illumination reinforces the shine of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and intricate shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Wave-like shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and groins.
The Haus Batlló in the Eixample district on the lively shopping street Passeig de Grácia Nr. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to the idea of Gaudí's idea for an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the apartment building Casa Batlló did not design Antoni Gaudí alone.
He worked with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Especially on its drawing board, the decorations for the representative apartment of the reality owner were created and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other sculptors and artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí’s Casa Milá house in the Park Güell, which also houses other works by Antoni Gaudí.
Shortly after its completion, the house was nicknamed "bone house" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms because of its house.
Others, in turn, called it the special window opening mechanism because of the "yawning house."
It is also said that at the top of the building is the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a central heating system, unique for the time, with venting channels and typical fireplaces for the house.
A little bizarre, her 45-degree inclination already seems.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all the building codes at the time and was by no means deceived by them.
Before the start of construction, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he made about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified by the result two years later that they demanded a remedy.
The councillors also came across the fact that the building with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no changes, quite the opposite - only fifteen days after the district's request in this regard, Josep Batlló submitted an application to approve the rental of the two highest floors in the house - and it was promptly granted to it.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery in 2. Floor was a social salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
Due to the basic elements of the conversion, all right angles and straight lines were eliminated and replaced by curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could chat comfortably without having to give up a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new façade, the house also received a rather unusual roof and two other floors due to Gaudí's conversion.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is clad and the lighthouses.
The play of these two colors gives all the floors of the house a maximum of light.
In doing so, he simply took advantage of the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors, which, on the contrary, absorb sunlight.
The house Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year to this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this is a quite profitable business, the visits were maintained, and they were also extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for visiting the monument is not a cardboard stem, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get a 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the house residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed rust? Women have different desires than men
Not the most amazing bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
Many things play a role in the selection - the weight, the height, the state of health and, last but not least, the gender of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend home where it is not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "get warm."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough venting canals in the core and also lie on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that mold forms under it.
Of course, what you are used to also plays a role in the choice.
If you have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, you will find it difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
“Probably all the hockey players who came back from the NHL have complained to me that they can’t sleep properly here anymore.”
“For their worn shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam – a shape memory polymer).”
"I also recommend these to sugar-sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can badly receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I got these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam) years ago for many hockey players, but also other customers.
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses are offered by the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico, among others."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to learn to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it nestles downright on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also provides protection against decubitus (wound burn).
When choosing the mattress size, you should still add the length of the soles of your feet to the body size, i.e. approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman, who are 180 cm tall, need such a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the sleepers should be available at least 90 cm lying width, together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
For the sake of comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you are lying on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of upholsterers and interior decorators, who has devoted herself to the problem of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and also presents this topic at technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same height.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grates at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with spring skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be attributable to the mould layer and the fine cushion.
"By hand or sitting down, you must not feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Fully upholstered beds with mattress and underlay such as combined siame twins have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and the cover cannot be washed, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that after five to seven years, the mattress is slowly becoming a huge (and clogged sieve).
This is another reason why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has her ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is still advisable to use a mattress protector, which you can easily pull off and wash.
Even if today mattress covers are usually made with all-round zipper, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially carried out alone, often seems like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of this!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are already none in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called. Use pocket spring core and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a substrate.
Latex or sandwich mattresses are suitable for non-adjustable slats with 14 to 18 spring strips (slats) (possibly also combinations of latex and coconut), and gratings with a larger number of slats, i.e. of 28 or more spring strips, with lumbar support in the lumbar region and the possibility of regulating the slat hardness.
Adjustable slats do not include mattresses with spring skeletons, as they do not react to ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This involves a special fastening of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press the spring strips in or even to angle them in such a way that they allow the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in at points.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started using soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses."
The ladies are also thought of - they are given these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or gratings with point-elastic contact pads with so-called contact pads are used. Multitorsion suspension determined.
The pressure is distributed to several points, reducing the tension.
But - if you use a bad (too big and full) pillow to the right mattress and proper rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
A 50 x 60 cm cushion, as the Scandinavians like, for example, seems ideal.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should balance the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials, or at least their admixtures.
Also for mattresses, the new magic word is called "organic".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example, castor oil and soybean oil.
Soy is probably used by all known manufacturers.
"Organic means in mattresses, which their core is made of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
However, natural products are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
However, you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent when sleeping.
Again, you make a difference between man and woman.
While in men a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves is used so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers have "warming" effect for women.
Extracts from red peppers stimulate blood circulation, so the weaker sex becomes pleasantly warm when you sleep.
What about today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have to rap 7000 crowns and more.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, since they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to be given this advantage.
You can see that saving on the mattress and the rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with quilted Visco foam Memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second is free to get.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at an almost cosmic pace.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads at the launches.
Tempure becomes soft with heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
Thus, it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but also generally increases sleeping comfort.
However, viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot cushions, which are intended to provide relief for the legs and the vessels.
Local manufacturers use the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products, for example.
More and more parents want human monitoring devices to have the kids under control
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for the search for cars, can just as well locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently as the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have terrified the case of the disappeared Anička and so they are looking for ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We are trying to tell everyone that this is by no means about spying, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood of tragedy," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
“I admit that there may be misuse of such devices in individual cases, for example, if you put it in someone’s pocket without him knowing about it, but we have not had such a case to record so far.”
"Most customers really buy it for safety reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of him.
“Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally when they don’t want to be controlled.”
"The mobile phones already aroused great expectations among the parents at first, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also debatable whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
“In planned kidnappings, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with him that it could be located with.”
“Today it’s the cell phone.”
“If such surveillance devices found wider use, they would also seek it, as their sale would certainly be accompanied by massive advertising.”
"In these cases, the criminals of the police are always one step ahead," says the psychologist.
However, she acknowledges that similar devices may well be helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be adjusted so that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
“Even if it were immediately destroyed, at least the last position of the person concerned is available.”
"In the case of more expensive devices, even a tilt meter is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning, indicating the position," claims Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to install special software.
The problem with the current tracking devices is that this is either about devices in matchbox size, which are similar to the trailers or smaller mobile phones.
There is always a risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin from Macro Weil, devices that look like normal digital clocks are therefore being tested in the present day.
“This has the advantage that the eventual attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or surveillance. Tracking device acts.
"Or he doesn't realize that until after a certain amount of time, which gives the police a time lead," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - towards bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in the vehicle location.
So to the combination of location function using the GPS system (just like with the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many ignition cords that you could wrap the whole of the Czech Republic you can hold you but only two years
The Czech Army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, being detonated with explosive devices.
The year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have been caring for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the ignition cords from the joint-stock company STV Group, a. s. for a lappy 40 million crowns.
In its justification for the purchase of this enormous quantity of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume about 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES addressed this, it is clear from this indication that the whole army would have to complete an extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not exempt.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometers of ignition cords be halfway justified.
This length, by the way, corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army holdings would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two meters of ignition cord are completely sufficient for the training of each new professional soldier, then the army has created a calming supply for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased demand of the pioneer and special forces.
Soldiers of the Rapid Operations Brigade recently complained to the Defense Minister Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises are severely restricted because of the lack of funds.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
“I also don’t know why they buy such tons of ignition cords from us.”
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll already know what they need them to do.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as traders would like to meet to the greatest extent possible," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, justified the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cord by saying that the army had thus stocked up on this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký from the STV Group speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians of only two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, but who wants to remain unnamed, so as not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the service life, all ammunition must be thoroughly tested whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not in vain, but cost more money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pejšek tells us the point of view of the Ministry of Defence's buyers.
Just for comparison, the annual consumption of ignition cords by police pyrotechnicians who liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army barely exceeds 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition, which it can consume before the end of the service life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords is kept open.
The Ministry of Defence is already having huge problems in the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-member Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, which addressed MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in a few years in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of ignition cords, which it has bought so cheaply today.
To this day, the contacts that I have gained thanks to the competition come to me
The victorious placement in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition has helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the previous vintage of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun loved to travel.
Only abroad did he realize that there was a lack of good accommodation at reasonable prices in Liberec.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in the sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a bold undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit back in the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them until recently was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel".
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the Pytloun hotels franchise have already come forward," says the number one entrepreneur from last year.
"A large share in this license sale to operate hotels has just been the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," adds Mr Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory has earned him greater notoriety, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend everyone who wants to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t need to win right away, every visualization is good.
He says that to this day he benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would not have otherwise occurred at all.
“With some people I’ve met thanks to the competition, I maintain regular business relationships to this day.”
In his opinion, the fame associated with the success is also reflected a little on each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
“I notice greater loyalty and pride in them that they are part of something that is given general recognition.”
I really don’t just see this as a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name has only come to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The victory euphoria was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his determination, Farmet has the worst behind him.
The prize for the first rank of the competition Vodafone Company of the Year last year was accepted by Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet.
At the time, the jury paid tribute to the efforts with which he stamped out a company from the small toolmaking in Česká Skalice, which makes hundreds of millions of sales.
"I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with the competition," says the previous year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for lease to his father, Karel Žďárský, in compensation for the property seized by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company with a few comrades of his father for the production of plastic tubs.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it has also entered the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only did our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, but our foreign partners also began to attach greater value to the fact of being able to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country," says Karel Žďárský.
However, the past year at Farmet was not only dedicated to the victory euphoria.
The appreciation was based on the economic results of the company in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just in 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool making products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but especially companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
“Of course, we could not escape this situation.”
"Sales declined by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to layoffs," explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company must sometimes take such unpopular measures.
But it succeeded in getting to grips with the situation and keeping the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
At one, the company was unwilling to make compromises - in investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, we encouraged our presentation at international trade fairs and acquired major prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything shows that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them also the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll around the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneur competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations already managed to get out of the world.
To the dubious winner of the next vintage of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" advanced the obligation to create documents on authorities that are available online.
Thus, more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Security Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register when checks on social security payers," said ČSSZ Jana Buraňová.
The purpose of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to comply with and repeal the nonsensical.
This year, for the fourth time, is part of an entrepreneurial competition, which was created by tsch. Wirtschaftszeitung (HN) is organized and is enjoying growing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder corporate activity.
"As for example, the number of income tax forms is concerned, we occupy a leading rank in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Traders of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity has been the proclaimed goal of all governments in recent years.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic takes the 74 in terms of corporate terms. Rank in, compared to the previous year a worse ranking by eight places.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first announced in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April to the end of the competition at the end of September.
The web address www.firmaroku.cz is used to register. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "anti-price" and has the public vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more than 105 pointless regulations and orders have already been registered for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles have to pay tolls for highways and expressways or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Sevens" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November on Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of a happening, in which personalities of political and public life regularly participate.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the Association of Small or Medium-Sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Tsch. Republic at the climax of the competition with the game.
"Where the state throws sticks between the legs of the entrepreneurs, there can be no real economic upswing, therefore it is my goal to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today unnecessarily make their business more difficult for the entrepreneurs," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
Efforts to eliminate nonsensical arrangements are having an effect.
In 2007, the people most imposed on the entrepreneurs were disturbed by the obligation to have to report to the trade office at the site of their permanent premises three days in advance the intention to drive with an exhibition stand to an exhibition or fair.
This obligation was waived by virtue of an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to have to report to the employment office business trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days - was so-called by the law on them. "Green card" abolished.
And - all good things are three:
The absurdity of 2009 was chosen the ordinance, which imposed it on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the consultation room.
This regulation was somewhat tempered by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement fell away.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsible Company of the Year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair undertakings.
"We would like to support such companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activity on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, which is the exclamer and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main competition Vodafon Company of the Year, companies for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspirational and offers enough material for a self-employed article.
Although they differ diametrically in relation to the subject matter of their activity, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is, for example, about handicapped people, because of personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, the Prague-based software company Et Netera also appeared, which promotes the emergence of non-formal sports teams among their employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also takes exemplary care of its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which she was honored with the title "Responsible Company of the Central Bohemia Region"; in the competition Vodafone Company of the Year, she took third place in the context of this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced, among other things, a flowing and also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week and this without a relative wage reduction.
At the title ceremony, the jury also honored the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their area and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to keep the consequences of our entrepreneurial activity and administration for the environment as low as possible," explains its managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, is interested in the health of its employees and therefore it has acquired ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, in addition, it promotes home work in its employees and in corporate actions it uses Cartering services, which are offered by a local sheltered workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region is also worth mentioning, which contributes to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We grant our employees contributions to food, for the commute, to increase their qualifications and for the holiday," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered for the category of Responsible Company of the Year, who answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly or incompletely completed answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the competition "Responsible Company of the Year", but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, as it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Bodenfonds in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate trader Luboš G. was handcuffed by the detectives.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a public competition that was currently taking place for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the plots offered in competition fell to a specific interested party.
He is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for this.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offence of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner public prosecutor's office told the Právo newspaper that she could not give further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by police.
In which way he was able to manipulate public competition, one can only speculate about it in view of the sparse official information.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomír Černá Land Fund, on Právo’s question in this regard, stated that the police had actually made arrests in the Pilsner branch of the Land Fund, during public competition.
"It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees," she said.
According to Ms. Černá, the public competition had the correct designation "call for the tendering of claims for the transfer of land under the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
“These persons, within the scope of the request, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the declared property value.”
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," the fund's spokeswoman explains.
Luboš G. was obviously available information about who had registered at the request and since he was himself a valid person, since he had bought a number of restitution claims, he offered to a property interest that he withdraws from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. has had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
He also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted because he issued land in replacement restitutions, to which location decisions on construction projects had already been made.
At that time, Luboš G. also acquired land from the Land Fund, for example, which was intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistral to the Borské pole industrial estate was planned.
Later he exchanged these very cheaply with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give a small contribution to a heavy heart in order not to jeopardize the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs increase by a few hundred a month
From January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also with higher water and wastewater charges and for district heating and in some places, rents are also growing.
Families will have to pull several hundred crowns more monthly from the wallet from January than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water supplies and in some places the district heating supplies will also become more expensive.
Electricity inflation alone costs housing households a few hundred more crowns each year.
The high-power prices have been reduced by all the main suppliers, so the clear promotion of electricity generation from renewable sources, especially from photovoltaic systems, is to blame.
Although gas is only moderately expensive, this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns more per year is to be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices of district heating vary from city to city.
Larger places, in particular, are planning price hikes.
For example, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 more crowns per month for district heating from January, more than 1000 crowns more per year families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague, in turn, face 9 percent higher water and wastewater charges and this in the event that the city increases the infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still one of the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and wastewater charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, in which from January the so-called. Rent regulation is eliminated.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January.
If you do not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to prosecute you in court.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments, are expected to increase by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech kids get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once a good whisky, which was stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks, after the enjoyment of which drunk Czech teenagers under fifteen must be most frequently treated.
No exception are children who have to sleep in their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
“Beer or wine is completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk.”
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the chief physician of the children's department at the central Bohemian clinic Hořovice.
“Whisky, if it succeeds in stealing a bottle from the father from the house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix him with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief medical officer.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
“The most common is about Fernet or rum.”
“This is today’s alcohol trend, especially in primary schools.”
"Occasionally it was also about Slibowitz, who you take from home," Ms. Jurinová said.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers in hospital admissions have long since ceased to be an exception.
In front of the clinic in Hořovice, which he has been working on since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatrics department of the hospital Motol, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
“A girl had to be hospitalized four times.”
"She started her career at the age of 12, when she was first admitted with 3.5 per mille of alcohol in her blood and also in combination with "extase,"" the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition grounds in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't feel strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief doctor wonders.
It is precisely the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in kicking off with their own offspring that is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not about a real dependency in the true sense of the word.
“Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol, including all related phenomena, and this is not the case with these children.”
In those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to the spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, Ms. Jurinová, about forty drunk children were admitted to the local department of paediatrics and adolescent medicine until mid-November.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospitalization, are included in the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home after outpatient treatment by parents or, if necessary, by the police will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children only drink such a bottle of schnapps in the school bench, there are, in the opinion of Mr. Pelikán, three seasonal amplitudes, on which one hundred percent reliance: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of sorrow because of the bad witness or for joy on the holidays."
"On Walpurgis Night, I have also experienced seven drunk children at once in the recording," emphasizes Doctor Pelikán.
A drunken child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles with only an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headaches in the morning after, which stem from the dehydration and the lack of glucose, can be driven away in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients, which the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up with a good mood without anything hurting anywhere."
"They're just a little confused about where they are," admits Doctor Pelikán, sometimes at least spoiling the patient's good mood by listing them the cost they'll cost the treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly to a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Every now and then I used this as a means of education, if I have directly calculated to the children during the visit, which cost their drunkenness and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such party," added Doctor Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse procedures to demand the costs necessary to heal the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter aircraft L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defence has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew on Tuesday to the Spanish city of Seville, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS settles.
This is the first time that machines of this type have been in possession of a foreign army.
Abroad, they have only been seen at maneuvers or air shows.
This is about the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seat L-159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took it over last week.
Jan Pejšek, according to the spokesman for the Ministry of Defence, is not yet known when she physically expedes the aircraft from Vodochody.
The single-seater L-159 fighter aircraft, in turn, were separated from long-term aircraft and this without further deposits and investments on the part of the Ministry’s department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were exchanged in current condition and appearance," Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seater warplanes, as the Defense Department signed a $200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 over the conversion of four superfluous L-159 to the two-seater version.
A new aircraft took over the army in July, the second it wants to take over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to enforcing the warplanes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
“The contract clearly states that the company EADS is the customer of the aircraft L-159 and that these are intended to train pilots of NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer in what way he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159s against a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At that time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered a tender procedure for purchasing, but addressed EADS directly.
The defence office at the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, the rest it wanted to sell.
By the way, the purchase of the Casa aircraft should also have a judicial backlash.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It would have had to select the aircraft on the basis of a whole-European tender and by no means by appealing to a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger as a ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at less risk of developing prostate cancer.
That's the surprising result of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is said to be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this especially in men up to sixty," explained the study's co-author, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if genetic risks or other risk factors are present, such as family health burdens, Ms. Eeles added.
In the period 1994-2009, she and her colleagues in Britain followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same likelihood of prostate cancer applied as to 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were of the same length.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men up to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two fingers mentioned, which already forms in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, leading Czech geneticist and former chairwoman of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was fleetingly aware of this study, but that he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven" so far.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicers were in many places all night on the road.
The D5 motorway between kilometer 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed for some accidents of trucks and cars and also the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague "stands".
This was said by Novinky.CZ the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto-Club (ÚAMK).
In kilometer 91 a truck crashed, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the road ditch.
There are also problems with kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway towards Prague.
Two trucks have also collided here.
The drivers should drive just behind Brno at kilometer 190 or drive over Brno and drive at kilometer 182 at the village of Kývalka.
This is where miles of traffic jams form.
An accident has also happened on the D11 and right at the entrance to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Motorcades form, for example, in the district of Prosek, the street Štěrboholská is also completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight in the morning, the Prague Crisis Staff meets.
There are also problems with the railway and on the airfield.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express train services due to snow drifts.
Problems exist, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should definitely be aware of the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport has been closed since Wednesday 11 a.m. until 5 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only passable with increased caution.
Around Vyškov, three secondary roads are completely impassable, snow drifts are formed in the vicinity of Brno and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
Three roads are still completely closed there: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow blowers will have to be used for snow removal.
When they become passable again, can not be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is required in the area of the White Carpathians.
On the roads, which for reasons of nature conservation can only be scattered with inert scattering agents, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, ČTK led.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most of all in northern Bohemia - in places up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly stops snowing.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
American troops have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, previously known only by their code designation XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will influence the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-accurate cannon.
Their projectiles are steered to the finish by laser with a accuracy of only a few meters.
The special projectiles of caliber 25 mm, which are designed for this rifle and contain highly explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target but at any point of their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy who is hiding behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
For it is usually not protected from above, so the murderous steel splinter rain from above can easily put it out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of "smart" technologies.
“The soldier basically proceeds like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact visor point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to push it off.
“Let’s say they measured 543 m.”
“When you push off, the gun charges up and shoots the projectile to the distance 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs will be relocated
Fujitsu is relocating its subsidiary in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specializes in computers and its maintenance, announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to the Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, a further 100 jobs of the Group should be accommodated there, which were previously distributed among the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, in addition, the open-plan offices in Astro Park would better accommodate the way employees work.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had been merely a tenant.
The responsible managing director Bernd Wagner said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure".
The excellent connection to the airport is particularly important for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of an important company within the region yesterday evoked joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Frankfurt Economic Affairs Director Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won again.
This is a "great confession to the location."
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted Fujitsu’s decision.
The city was informed early by the management about the intention.
"We have of course offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been the decisive factor.
Now it is a matter of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
“I hope the owner and landlord of the building is cooperative.”
The house on Rathausplatz, which was previously used by Fujitsu, and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were one of the most controversial construction projects in the spa town with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz ten years ago.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city entrance was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as a parking lot and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment consulting and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still affiliated with Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group in 2006 together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu-based conuser describes itself as the world's third-largest IT provider.
He provides companies, for example, computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu counts far more employees in Munich.
The subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving into Frankfurt-Niederrad from Bad Homburg, and the other subsidiaries at this location will be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the Astro Park office building.
The twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - is based, among other things, in the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industries.
Amazon suspends server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is becoming increasingly distressed.
The Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
WikiLeaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's manhunt lists, is said to be in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Wikileaks of Amazon servers supplanted."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revelation activists said via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the WikiLeaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic cables in order to be able to cope with the high access figures to the documents.
WikiLeaks said: “Great – our dollars are now being spent to employ people in Europe.”
If Amazon has such a problem with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servers by WikiLeaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had done investigations, the television channel CNN reported, citing the office of Liebermans.
The chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have liked Amazon to take this action earlier in light of the previous releases of classified information by WikiLeaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be denied use of servers in other countries.
"WikiLeaks' illegal, outrageous and reckless approach puts our national security at risk and endangers lives around the globe," the statement said.
“No responsible company – whether American or foreign – should help WikiLeaks in its efforts to disseminate stolen material.”
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's manhunt list.
According to a report by the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, the exact location is known to Scotland Yard.
The internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as intrigue of his opponents.
WikiLeaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there had been threats.
“There were even calls for a murder of Julian Assange.”
That's why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson was obviously responding to statements from North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican Governor Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person in charge of the WikiLeaks revelations be charged with treason and executed.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - apparently ironically - said on television Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Meanwhile, an exchange of blows broke out between the White House and Assange.
American President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had called for Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's resignation in case she is responsible for recently revealed spying calls to diplomats.
“I’m not entirely sure why we care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one website.”
The U.S. government is now putting the protection of its databases to the test.
The Vice-Director of the Center for Counter-Terrorism Measures, Russell Travers, had been appointed as special representative, the White House said.
Travers was responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that became necessary after the disclosure of the embassy reports by WikiLeaks.
The White House also wants to review ways the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
The U.S. government also announced that it would provide for the safety of dissidents and activists if they were put in danger through the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have made every effort to get in touch with them," foreign ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
“We stand ready to protect them if that become necessary.”
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream confectioners are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice come from?
From the gelatier and from the gelataio.
The gelatier, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice cream making.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream from the fridge with a spatula, spreads it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don’t have to go to Anzola dell’Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can't get past the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Ice University established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from its machines can meet the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also multi-day special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something of his own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia comes in because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatier Luciano Ferrari first explains to the participants the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
In his training, Luciano does not forget the icing on the one of the national and southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to manufacturing seems quite simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device that heats everything to 85 degrees with an electronic program and then immediately cools to four degrees.
Then he turns up a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, basis for all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is assayed with questions: Can ice cream only be produced with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you give free rein to your own experimentation?
Luciano warns against being led astray by the zeitgeist.
If you talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", you may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, only it must be sold within a day, otherwise it will collapse, and the customer bites on loud ice granules.
Certain variations on the base mass are permitted.
It becomes more exciting with the aromas.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section or in the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
“The suppliers will all try to turn on you dozens of flavored additives.”
“But you should just experiment.”
Either with the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all possible chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to go to the ice machines.
Luciano lets them produce four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream each - with or without eggs in the base, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural additives.
The fruit ice varieties are also subjected to the same experiment.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better in terms of taste.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is made by the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and slightly less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture raises the taste of a gelato correctly, says Luciano.
Ice production is a calculation task: If peach puree is used with a lot of sugar, the sugar content must be reduced in the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is required.
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make it easier to calculator.
Making ice cream no longer requires as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base material helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is simultaneously beaten until creamy and cooled to minus temperatures.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns are not missing.
The Brazilian Gustavo licks himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree when the oversized hand blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Controllers in the twilight
The European food authority Efsa is subverted by the industry experimenting with genetic plants.
This accusation is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," Testbiotech chief executive Christoph Then told reporters in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group on genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the lobbyist association Ilsi for years.
It is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has played a major role in the Efsa testing regulations for genetically produced plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The Efsa regulations are identical in paragraphs with position papers of the Ilsi and thus bear the signature of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interest.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager has recently been without conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which the Federal Environment Agency, as well as EU parliamentarians, have made noisy.
Efsa, however, cannot identify a conflict of interest.
We use all serious data, including those of industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, according to a statement.
The experts who work for Efsa do not require that they have no contacts with the industry.
You would have to disclose these, though.
Kuiper is conceding his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - among other things, for the risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying assignment.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified plants are currently approved without any feeding test in animals and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not being tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn is doing on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to only test isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you don't look for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?" Then asks accusingly.
Angelika Hilbeck thinks so, too.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this field, as in the USA, industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
For companies critical studies are usually not published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck asserts.
The trail of the stones
Uli Gsell also got some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It's snowing.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators had arrived and had begun to break off a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing lay in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a soft coarse stone, installed between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's secured some of the chunks.
“These stones are relics.”
“They must not disappear.”
He enthuses: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and grounded."
When he sawed one up, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the chunks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell, too.
The trail of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen on a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone realm.
The 44-year-old is dealing with old stones.
He bought everyone who was involved in the demolition in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame they would be ground to gravel or disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden bunch that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he says, when it was written in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he talked to the S-21 opponents, for days.
And he has explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, it would be the most sensible thing if the stones were used further.
About 200 S-21 opponents took one of the on average 80 kilos heavy cuboids, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, some but also in the hope of being able to give him back during a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, 25 large truckloads.
About half are still stored in the forest, the rest is long since sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, house builder.
From everywhere they had come and dragged away what the trunk and trailer could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the stumbling have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone isn't special," says Rongen.
“Wouldn’t be the political component.”
He climbs into his SUV, taking a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied and dropped out of law, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone dealer.
And stone lovers.
He stores 40000 tons of stones.
From all over Germany, he carts his treasures together.
He says he is the largest old stone merchant in the republic.
He's slowing down.
In the snow lie ornately hewn sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the path through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once upon a time, the cuboids belonged to the grandstand of Stuttgart's Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral of Sankt Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be hewn by hand and moved with simple pulleys and oxcarts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if you were to shred something like that.”
He has not become rich, certainly not rich in stone.
But 14 people employ the stone merchant today, in addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual recycler.
He will have to go to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to be saved there.
Talent struggle for high potentials
There is a lot of crowding at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of ideas competition, they should talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, relying on cooperations with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates in the lecture halls as early as possible before they come to the labour market and be courted by others.
And because the universities do not publish any lists on the achievements of their students, one tries to spy on the exceptional talents in practical projects and to bind them to themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company is courting the talents.
A young lady from the human resources department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents about internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the Group.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is responsible for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students get in touch with the industry and gain experience."
“VW can simultaneously get to know students, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as employees.”
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not uncommon.
What is new is that so offensively are fought for the students.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The battle for the newly graduated will probably be even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
Instead, they have to praise themselves and especially for highly skilled workers.
Graduates from the engineering disciplines in particular are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting firm KPMG, Roman Dykta is going on a talent hunt.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG-Race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt, in which the participants have to find their way on the basis of GPS coordinates.
The company plans to send eight promising students across the United States next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Those who are allowed to participate will decide in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When blowing and stinging around the high potentials at the universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
“We want to stand out from the crowd with the race.”
“Just a simple sailing trip was not enough for us.”
For talent hunter Dykta, the bill seems to be working out.
“We have contact with all participants of a similar action last year to this day.”
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to direct bushing on campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular are also popular at professional fairs.
“We are trying to reach graduates at trade fairs.”
"About the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, Human Resources Manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young talent.
There are currently 35 vacancies advertised on the company website.
“It’s very hard to fill vacant positions right now.”
"This costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to contact the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University of Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not popular with the solar specialist.
For this purpose, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often cannot offer this," says HR Manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good opportunities for advancement are other decisive factors.
Solarworld took the 55 in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute. place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute draws up an annual leaderboard of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for employees.
Human Resources Manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also provide positive points for job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking especially for external assessments about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authentic.
And that, according to Kriegler, means above all internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through one's own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within the company’s own workforce.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
If you treat your people well and identify with the company, they would advertise their employer all by themselves to friends and acquaintances.
"This is like a game with gang," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
There will be no new oil drilling off the coast of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been issued by the government in Washington - and thus finally revoked its previous plans.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the drilling platform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the disaster, which killed eleven workers and led to the biggest environmental disaster in the U.S., President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The supporters want to reduce the dependence of the United States on oil supplies from abroad.
Anyone responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been conclusively clarified.
At the heart of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is facing billions in demands.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is due to present its findings in the course of December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new disaster.
Currently, the competent control authority, which had fallen into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has announced that it will close lucrative tax loopholes for the oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by consultant firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what exactly will change with regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be deferred until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland is burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of leaked crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't plague yourself," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You're still going to get enough oil sludge in front of your lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has followed the attempt to photograph a boy wading to the chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: In the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene looks almost pretty.
That brown crude oil swaths float below the surface is not to be seen.
Previously, she collected shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, a bristled pipeline poured out of a bristled pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-containing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst-poleted regions in the world.
On the drive through the mangrove swamps crisscrossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat stirs up brown broth, whoever dips his hand in the water, pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black liquorice sticks from the ground, sadly occasionally encountered palm trees hang their fronds.
Swarms of birds, as are usually the case in wetlands, are sought in vain: As soon as the outboard engine is silent, ghostly tranquility spreads in the former paradise, which smells like a gas station.
"What is happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari sinster: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, where the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
While the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped from the entire Delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5000 wells of drilling and 7000 kilometers of pipelines every day, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steely racks like bizarre sculptures protrude from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the boreholes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most corroded to the core.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta ecosystem in 50 years: year after year, the amount of oil, as it penetrated into the sea off Alaska 21 years ago in the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" - one of the biggest environmental disasters in the history of humanity.
Who is to blame for the ongoing eco-GAU, is argued about.
While Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaking pipelines as the main culprit.
Shell is applying significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the group in 2008: The rate of defects on the lines alone is “many times higher than elsewhere”.
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smudged workshop in the open air, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are naked naked and oil-smeared to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, which can be partly connected to tubes, partly arbitrarily scattered on the site, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's chief executive.
First, gasoline penetrates through the pipes into the collection pot, later trickles out at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters each day: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest oil state in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price at almost 40 euro cents per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkerers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: In this way, according to experts, at least 16 million liters of crude oil are lost to the country every day throughout the Niger Delta.
However, only a vanishingly small part of the provisionally intermediate raw material is illegally refined: organized criminal networks, which should include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share into tankers and sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate as to whether the environmental catastrophe is due to the activities of the population or the lax mode of production to be purely academic.
“If the oil companies were not perceived as intruders and if they had not destroyed the livelihoods of the fishermen so thoroughly, there would be neither sabotage nor theft and illegal refineries.”
In the meantime, however, the relationship of the Ogoni to Shell in particular is so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the group would be possible: "Perhaps other nationalities like the Chinese turn out to be better."
Michael gets nervous.
"It's time for you to disappear," says the muscular oilman.
“Every minute the soldiers can come.”
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who mainly come from the north of the country, also want to benefit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has put our country on the dog in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction fault in A380 engines
The A380 apparently has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction fault in the investigation of an emergency-landed machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas-Airbus in early November were apparently much more fortunate than previously known: The Australian Air Security Agency has identified a major safety problem in its investigations in the engines of some A380 aircraft - and is now warning of a possible construction fault.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In the case of an oil hose connection, it could generate fatigue cracks and leaks, it said in a statement published this Thursday by the authority ATSB.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
Rolls-Royce-produced engines in 20 A380 aircraft are affected.
Underneath is the Qantas Airbus, which is on the 4th. November had to make an emergency landing in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the UK turbine manufacturer.
She filed a plea in an Australian federal court in Sydney, which allows him further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline would demand damages for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had loosened and the wings damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide now have to be replaced.
Australian investigators announced they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the engines affected.
The safety recommendation was the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety problem was considered sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas plane, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-deck plane is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Nationwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Overnight snow has fallen almost all over the country.
On many roads there is chaos, trains and flights are cancelled.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter is frosting Germany: In freezing temperatures, almost the whole republic is snowed on Thursday at night - which in many places leads to traffic chaos.
In the north and the east there are sometimes 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
Traffic is severely restricted on several highways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrography Office (BSH) expects storm surges with water levels of 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on the highways and federal roads led to significant problems.
According to the severe weather center Meteomedia, alarm level was therefore in purple in Saxon Switzerland - the highest level ever.
Partly 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
Several trucks and cars got stuck there during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, the police authorities reported major disturbances on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stalled traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are considerable disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, overturned trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and turnouts are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train by firefighters and rescue workers.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
Winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still almost 400 cots available for them.
Accidents occurred on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver was killed in the collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The engine driver was slightly injured.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg, a similar accident occurred due to snow-covered roads: Again, a truck was captured on a level crossing because the vehicle got stuck.
The driver died.
Four passengers were injured on the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she rolled over with her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore already swirl up in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the money house is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to €500 million.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers were allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to get the cost of the renovation out again - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesperson did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties themselves and subsequently rent back," he said.
Germany’s largest credit institution is thus relocating its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers from the investors of an in-house fund in mid-2007 for 272 million euros and subsequently extensively renovated.
According to the data, the energy conversion swallowed up around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring a lot of money to the bank.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers now renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead buddies
More than 10,000 people have thought of the buried miners in New Zealand, who were declared dead after several explosions at a mine.
The bodies could still not be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 miners, aged between 17 and 62, were buried underground.
A probe had been let down into the accidental shaft, but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and further subsequent explosions, no rescue workers were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have so far not been recovered.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They remained silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were set up on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including garments and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, the flags were waving at half-mast.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would come back to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told the commemoration.
“But they never came home.”
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he had seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
In the first explosion on the 19. In November, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases are displaced, it will start to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police President Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores old genre boundaries with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising".
What audience might the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and puts his opponents around with almost superhuman powers in rows - sounds ideal for young male viewers in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and tears his enemies' intestines out of the living body when he has a bad mood.
On the other hand, Eineauge, as it is actually called, does not say a word about the whole film, and the other characters can only be carried away to one or two sentences or a few excruciating death screams.
Otherwise, it will be silent and revelled in the creepy beautiful hilly landscape of Scotland, which will set the backdrop for the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal more for adult cinematographers with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice if a film has multiple target groups, it's only a shame if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream or a little less brutality to the arthouse with a little more humor.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be squeeched by the brain mass splashing around and the intestines.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when Eine-eyes set off for freely interpretable reasons with a troupe of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and are stuck in lulls and fog for an eternity before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that has earned some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it's all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from that for the viewer.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly laces his throat with his icy pictures and the sinister trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the incomprehensible hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy, who is faithful to one-eye, preserves something like innocence, everyone else is driven by anger.
Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who for enemies and temporarily allies eventually becomes a warrior from hell, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means perdition, but perhaps only for the already depraved.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to annoyance, excitement and wonder.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is resisting to comment on this - it still allows for checks.
Towards midnight from 5 to the 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest major city, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Their name appears in documents from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built with help from North Korea in the cuboid, hidden in a valley that is running off the electricity.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA at the end of April 2008, the reactor, also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to generate plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, on the other hand, the technology from the fifties is hardly good.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, it blended in where what components of the reactor were before the destruction, which was a scaled-down copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos that show the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was about to be commissioned, it said, but had not yet been equipped with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, little more is known than then, yes the puzzles became rather larger with time.
Former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoir that the CIA was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar before the attack, but saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an "alleged reactor", even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible".
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior U.N. diplomat replied in the summer only lapidary that the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians hurriedly removed the rubble of the alleged "unused military building" and thoroughly leveled the site.
Nevertheless, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar that had been made by humans.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack through a Member State, which are likely to be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown principal - perhaps Israel - has bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot therefore independently verify its authenticity.
Syria has always claimed to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
The uranium comes from the Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
However, the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - just like the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed-out building.
But Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," Premier Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently reiterated the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been dragging down inconclusively since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the headquarters of the IAEA in Vienna admits - after all, a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is in the room, over which the IAEA is watching.
The IAEA apparently sees three other facilities as the key to progress in reconnaissance, which are supposed to be "in functional connection" with the suspected reactor - and unlike this still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which facilities are involved, nor what function they have or what makes them appear suspicious.
According to the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and located a building complex near Masyaf on satellite images, most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or right next to a military base - it is precisely with this justification that Syria denies the IAEA access to the three places.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be sent by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities by a tip from the US intelligence services.
The IAEA has indications, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production."
But there is “no evidence of sensitive activities”, i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes necessary to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb should later have been separated from it, there are at best plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could recover valuable traces was stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the rubble has remained.
The al-Tibni salt mine, located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, which Syria examined for its suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste in 1998, is considered unlikely to the IAEA.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
Footage from orbit shows, however, that Syria was doing earthworks in the three suspicious locations and removing large containers after the IAEA demanded access.
This can be coincidence, but has hardly helped to clear up the suspicion.
In addition, diplomatic circles say that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there, which should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only the effort shows how much interest the inspectors are.
However, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
While Western diplomats in Vienna had accesed a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter did not have a high urgency, for example, US Ambassador Glyn Davies has brought into play for a few months so-called special inspections, one of the sharpest means that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option that I'm open to in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: On the one hand, it requires a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still-named directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Much more is not known about it - but that is enough for restlessness.
The rumor persists that the woman, a Muslim, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some shooting days planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is filmed in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still being protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, a Bosnian newspaper has now reported - Jolie is herself ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, which they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims told her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended, according to the UN refugee agency, to dismiss Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, has granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she has no political intentions with her film, has worked with a lot of effort into the conflict of Yugoslavia, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all sides involved.
However, it remains vague in terms of content.
So a second synopsis of the film circulates on the net, which then sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other in it even before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is taken to a Serbian camp, in which he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different from the variant "rape victim has a crush on torturers".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, according to Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: By illegally putting the script on the net, like so many before.
Nothing like leaving here
This evening it finally goes right round for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans jost with joy with crashing loud music, they stamp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in southern Ireland's Cork quakes because the players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Bierpong" is the bizarre spectacle, to win there is 500 Euro victory award plus airline tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the restrained computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to enjoy himself in the process of distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not fun in Las Vegas, he will hold job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
“It’s so far away from home and I don’t have a job there yet.”
After all: his girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had a ruck, suck her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their fortunes abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The young are leaving: As with the Tanners, it looks like many families on the island.
100,000 Irish people will probably leave the country in the near future, experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI predict in Dublin.
By 2015, they even expect 200,000 emigrants.
A heavy loss for the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
If the forecasts are true, an emigration wave is comparable to that Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of upswing, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, tristesse is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling the young, well-educated Irish people, for whom it has only been uphill so far.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, there was money in abundance.
In the meantime, however, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are a lot of reader letters from young emigrants who complain: "Everything goes down the drain in Ireland."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers – but whoever can, goes away and our country is losing an entire generation.”
“The last one please turns off the light.”
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future raising because the government is only eye-catching and no longer offering young people any future prospects.
"They are reducing minimum wages, but they have no strategy on how to create new jobs," says the 20-year-old.
She watches her fellow students move from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is having to emigrate herself in four years.
“This thought is sad and depressing.”
Men like Stephen McLarnon try to fill the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the subject of work abroad.
"For young professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On his website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
What it feels like to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are just raising a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hanover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his homeland, because he makes extra shifts to be able to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
“I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I am almost never again.”
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through cooled-out rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways park large, expensive cars.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for 380,000 euros four years ago - 100 percent credit-financed.
"It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start again."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation he often hears at the moment.
"Nobody has to go hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
“Working abroad for a while, that’s not the worst thing that can happen — maybe we feel like Irish people only.”
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
“After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply.”
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
Leave the future open and just see how life is going elsewhere.
He has already had a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t things go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is one thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27. Birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could degenerate into a fare-of-life party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
“Farewell, that sounds scary.”
"Let's call it a way-away party, quite loose, with some friends, a few drinks, a couple of games."
The Democative Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is becoming stronger, just like the support of private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the findings of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's September and October survey.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and second, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (s. Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been around approx. 6% grows, the number of democracy advocates increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year's sharp slump, such a trend can be seen.
Yet only half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (s. Diagram 2).
Ca. 44% of respondents said they are satisfied with their country's democratic practice. This is as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trust their country's Congress and 45% of their government. Both figures correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and previous years, respectively). 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
That this continued even during the Great Depression may be because Latin America's countries experienced only a brief period of recession and recovered quickly.
Moreover, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America rose only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again by 32% this year.)
Yet from country to country there are strong differences in mood (s. Diagram 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in a widespread thinking of progress.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the beginning of the survey, many respondents in Latin America see a bigger problem in crime in their country than in unemployment (s. diagram 5).
Ca. 31% say that either they themselves or a family member have been victims of a crime in the last year. However, compared to 38% last year, the figures have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The increasing economic performance is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economy: approx. 71% of respondents nationally stated that the private sector is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (s. Diagram 6).
Ca. 58% said that only the market economy can bring progress to their country, compared to 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are in favor of a private sector), although their leftist president, Hugo Chávez, nationalized many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
The respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the US, with this role being assumed by Venezuela in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
An Electoral Flood
No one expected the elections to be held on 28. November would be perfect in Haiti.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of election workers who rushed to the battered country to help.
Overcrowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballot papers in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were only part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless as a result of the earthquake in January, roamed around in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some alleged front-runners, demanded the lifting of election results due to an alleged fraud.
There have been some violent protests across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, the head of the U.N. mission in Haiti, described the election "as quite good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement from observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious they may be, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is allegedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will the preliminary results on the 7th. Announce December.
The expected runoff election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, the rap musician Michel Martelly and the former first-lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval among the voters, declares from the electoral authority to the winner of the run-off election, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the start of the election, approx. 250,000 ID cards needed to vote not yet distributed.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries consider a legitimate, recognized government to be an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves are of the same opinion.
Secretly in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that pushed up her popularity rate by 20 points to over 50%. That's the highest figure since her election in 2007.
Whether this will help her to re-elect next year, however, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs for this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after his wife's election, frequently drew up budget plans that did not fully take tax revenues, economic growth and inflation into account.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenues at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández administration lost a majority in Congress last year.
Yet the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27. October led to further rifts.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
Yet after chaotic sessions (at which one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery) Congress failed to pass the budget for 2011.
"I'm not going to discuss it," the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to next year, giving the president even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, yet numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - are driving the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be its main goals, rather than the inflation cut.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, bullying the private sector and purging the National Institute for Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently garnished the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
She has called on the private sector and the union leaders to hold talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
The high world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Yet inflation undermined the growth spurt by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina financially to the rest of the world.
Earlier this year, the government reached an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's previous debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for a deal with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom she ca. $6.7 billion owes.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
Yet last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in creating a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without the support of her husband after the end of her term.
If so, it needs the support of the middle class, which has largely had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been brought to her will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly overturn many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On the 27. In November, more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and city councils in the five boroughs. This is seen as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relationships, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma herself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has changed his relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but only barely.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater independence for Taiwan, received nearly 50% of the vote, the KMT received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's vote share has been around. 8% dropped.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, Taiwan-used incidents such as truck convoys with riot makers, flag-waving mass parades and only sparsely clothed dancers.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious assassination attempt.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech to a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
when a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystanding spectator was killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Regardless, the attack has affected the election, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
Perhaps China was the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, the candidates debated plans for social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China’s military threat.
This is why the KMT does not like to put its relations with the government in Beijing at the forefront.
But this time, the DPP also avoided fomenting anti-China sentiments too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
For his part, it would like to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back into the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
Certainly, it also wants political integration. But the most important thing first.
It prefers to wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai’s reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working people and the youth.
Tsai found great approval as the DPP's presidential candidate, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she, too, is able to build close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offered a "trustworthy alternative" to Ma's hasty rapprochement with China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to renounce the presidential nomination.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is struggling to choose its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
Ma's values are bad, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing scissors between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong demeanor of the DPP suggests that Taiwan advocates a re-approximation only to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you perform at the request of a president, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony at the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza," the nomination appears a little unusual. Yet it complies with the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have released a maximum of three albums prior to the release of the album with which he became known to the general public.
Their 2010 ambitious album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her lively voice and a good sense of pop, funk and Latin music, you can easily compare Spalding to Norah Jones in 2003, whose great success in 2003 as a jazz interpreter in this category of Spalding's nomination is the closest.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" by the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Iyers' competitors include, among others. "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a ravenous favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme," has been awarded in the contemporary jazz category, which is usually more likely to feature albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category large group. He thus competes against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life album "Pathways" is a good example for a bass player as a democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classics categories
The classic nominations for the 53rd. Grammy Award includes a colourful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is led by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with links to Southern California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is the No. 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandolin concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical music producers, five artists have been nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical music albums are Bruckner's symphonies No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the Orchestra and Choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" by the BBC
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" nominated for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was on 4. January at the Disney Hall of the L.A. Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen, premiered and recorded.
The ca. 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to the former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondolin Concerto" received a nomination in the instrumental solo category with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece specifically for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I've used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman explained in a phone interview.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the orchestral performance category for a recording of Stravinsky's works with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson nominated.
Only women have been nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Exactx and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the category Classic Crossover, the soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
However, according to a statement from the commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious center complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, declared Thursday morning.
“As an American, that makes me proud.”
“It shows that justice is in place.”
"There are few opponents," he added.
“They’re just very loud.”
“There are wonderful people living in this valley.”
The session began at 18:00 and discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with voices on both sides fairly evenly distributed, according to Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," one comment read.
“It’s a different planet of the apes, and the Statue of Liberty is lying dead in the sand.”
“America is at the end.”
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, e.g. near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on the 11th. September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community with approx. 135 families have lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. Yet they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtering systems.
The new, ca. 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and become about 13m high.
She should be on the ca. 17,500 m2 plot on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School are created.
Opponents can still object to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow for new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of an alien bacterial species, which can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is, in their view, a sign that a life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
“This organism has two options.”
“He needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow.”
"That makes it very special, even though it's almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," Paul C.W explained. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found, the bacterium in California's Mono Lake grows even further when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the report Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for extraterrestrial life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study looks at microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were announced gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems organisms can initiate biochemical processes with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements' that, in our opinion, are absolutely vital, are not necessarily fixed," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of the Open University of Milton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose the mono lake due to the high arsenic content.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, she assumed that microbes exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
“The toxicity of arsenic is mainly due to the fact that it behaves chemically similar to phosphorus.”
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other.”
“But the difference is so great that arsenic works differently than phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smears virtually everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, the fact that it can also survive in arsenic shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, is not new to the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic. But so far, there hasn't been a working example.
Arsenic was more common in the early Earth years, she says, that's why science has assumed that early life forms used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may have evolved differently than it did in the early Earth Ages," according to Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel were found Thursday's Los Angeles County Sheriff, according to testimony.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van, which housed the animals outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to authorities' statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two on Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are well up," Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
“They were returned to their rightful owners.”
Whitmore did not give precise details of the dogs' site nor the circumstances that led to their discovery.
“The investigation is ongoing.”
"We don't want to say any more about that," Whitmore explains.
“We are following some traces.”
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They received their two dogs on Wednesday afternoon at a county animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were uninjured, according to authorities.
Yet the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek were looking to introduce at the competition this week on behalf of their Japanese owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was supposed to take part in the competition.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs were scheduled to take part in other competitions on the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They frequently stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - into their motel room.
The thick-furry Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open so that the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car as stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised a finder's wage to anyone who could give a reference to the corgis. The animals were implanted microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage would be paid.
The lion roars again after judicial approval of MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainties, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prepared" credit plan to pay off the $5bn debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so nothing stands in the way of the restart of MGM under the direction of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will head the somewhat slimmed-down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees is from over 400 to approx. 320 lowered.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will actually not enter into effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself contributes $75 million, is leading the company. Funding is expected to be in place by mid-December.
The studio's restructuring began in May 2009 with the order to help investment bank Moelis & Co, the management that struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, in solving its financial problems.
In August, managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert, who became known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to solve MGM's financial worries and pay out the studio's more than 140 creditors lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussions, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for purchase.
Yet the auction attracted few bidders and none wanted to pay the $2bn demanded by creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started all over again when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors after months of debates and internal disputes at the end of October.
If MGM officially survived the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The stake for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, is $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 monthly to run the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan with seven or eight films to hit theaters in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million and $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, the approx. 18% of the MGM loan financed, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys keeps your gift budget in balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gimmicks can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game costs about 10 classic skipping ropes or approx. 48 cans of Play-Doh equals.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys under $80, I visited three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into effect. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost slightly less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, there is a wider range in the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin.
There are more and more button cell-powered toys coming to market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(Unless otherwise stated, all prices for Toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years old) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs singing a note when you press on their stomachs.
Press once corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Warning: Once you start pressing, you can’t stop.
For a combination of sand and dance, the Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for kids from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic puppet offers interplays such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the new hinge feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as a dance instructor. However, her parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the 80s, you certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he's back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards that can make a car ride a lesson, with a know-it-all with autocorrection function as a teacher.
If you do not want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as instructive as those on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which, after Leapfrog's first major revision of the Leapster range, is equipped with a new, brighter screen.
None of the versions are compatible with older cassettes.
Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Finally, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no larger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out. It is great for an improvised spelling competition.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go alone after the offer in the toy shops, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match character pack ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle fabric animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The beetle quickly moves on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can withstand some things.
Ours fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in our dog's mouth.
Police operations in China are getting gentler
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin stepped over an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, and issuing orders with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order, feared and despised for their arbitrary crackdowns and their penchant for violence - to impress viewers.
"Stand straight!"
“Look straight ahead!”
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like!"
Four girls, barely outgrown their teenage age, with white gloves and identical olive green jackets and pants stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps stood in a straight row.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-and-white striped bows.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang notes disdainfully.
“Models are pretty.”
Several governments have already tried to polish up the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
Guangdong province introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-staring: In 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an improperly set-up food truck and stared at the operator until it packed in after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been stepping up the city's police strips. They were specially selected for their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are meant to give the coarse-sleeping police a softer, feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture that the Chinese have of these city commandos.
Rightly so, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal laws with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
Yet the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death when he filmed her with his mobile phone as they crushed a protest against a dump.
Last year, a training manual by Beijing officials was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how offenders can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon trader suffered brain injuries after a handcuff with five officials.
A violent video game that can be downloaded from the Internet is showing Chinese-trained officials in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy regarding the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "truly thorough cleanup."
Sceptics find the current approach to significantly inadequate.
When the district sought eight female recruits by ad in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to the job advertisement, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic facial features."
They should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends with reaching the 26. Year of life.
According to the officials, the activity for women over 25 is physically too exhausting.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official told the quasi-governmental website Rednet.com.
“Whether the candidates get the job first depends on their outward appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc.”
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female Chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not want to agree to this description,
However, admitted that in China, size specifications in job advertisements for both genders are not unusual.
The same is true for even facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is debatable in China.
But people with disabilities or physical dismissals do not need to apply.
"We can't use lame or hunchbacks here," Mr. Zheng said.
“Your image would not be good.”
Liu Yi, who patrols in Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple bakes and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not perceive as sexist that such great emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimnes, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not regret the short attitude, as they would have more ambitious career plans than simply shying traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are hunted away.
“Mr. Wang, please get out of here.”
"We've told you this so many times before!" explains Frl. Xu a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily let his pasta kitchen, which was attached to a bicycle cart, in the process.
According to the officials, the activity is monotonous rather than exhausting.
"It's the same almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the goods of the traders, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals by reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are often exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after rumors circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officials were injured in the nighttime incident, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such violence.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from quiet Baonguang Square, where female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired contrary to regulations on the sidewalk instead of in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After a 15-minute hesitation, the officers with their faces grimly made their way to their vehicles and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, stayed behind. In the process, he turned his white name tag around to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
Yet they were not trained to present a clean image.
“Sometimes we proceed verbally.”
"Sometimes, however, physically," Mr. Li explains soberly.
“Most of the time, people start the fight.”
Prosecutor will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the accusations made against him after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to give her husband a lobbying job, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
This decision ends the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Republican from Nevada. Until the scandal, which made headlines nationwide and put a dampener on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" about the ruling after the one-year investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplary sentence.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Department of Justice that the investigations against Senator Ensign had been discontinued and that there were no further charges in this matter.
The Justice Department did not want to comment on the case.
The ruling was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department. In their opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave reason to suspect that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers, helped to make lucrative assignments to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an election campaign by Ensigns.
Ensign made contact with some political friends to get Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after hiring Hamptons lobbying.
Since Hampton was still on Ensign's election team recently, it was not allowed to lobby for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on the revolving door lobbycracy.
According to the evidence released, "it appears to be an agreement and the violation of the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the government's sights.
While the Justice Department officially declined to disclose the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics advocates, the ministry seems very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeats persecuted with great interest by the media, including last year's decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrifying," said Melanie Sloan, the chairwoman of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" association (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who have various charges against Mr. brought Ensign to court.
"This basically means that senior government officials can now assume that the laws do not apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr.'s main defender Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day in which he was told that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had cooperated with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office repeated again in a statement Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to explain the legal arguments he had put forward to prosecutors in more detail.
“I’m not comfortable going into the conversation details between the Department of Justice and myself. Only this much is said: we believe we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to discontinue the investigation into a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, after which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons have violated federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there had not been enough evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada that long supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton thanks to the help of Mr. Ensign lobbyist work found.
An email from December 2008 proves that after the company Mr. Hampton has moved on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton had, in which he told him that he was "knocking" at the Home Office because of a thing.
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another customer from Nevada, Allegiant Air, arranged to meet for lunch and asked the transport secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after these Mr. Hampton had stopped for lobbying.
When, for the first time, information about this affair was leaked to the public last year, Mr. Ensign among his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had finished fourth in the Republican ranking.
After not noticed for many months, Mr. Ensign two weeks ago reporters seeking a third term in the Senate.
in the announcement that Mr. Ensign is no longer the target of police investigations, his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, said the senator hopes that the ethics committee will very quickly follow the example of the Department of Justice and stop its investigations.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing its hard work in the service of the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention to Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent out their reports of grisly witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the trial surrounding rape and bed-chained children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was charged with killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, come to an official end when the judge's ruling on the death sentence the jury pronounced is dropped.
But Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications in court that set out grounds for an appeal and that the courts will keep for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has resulted in a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, prompt penetration of inflammatory details, so that the jury had been inadmissibly influenced by the public indignation.
This objection could prompt the appeals courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"Just as I experienced it during this process, I believe it is really a danger when the entry of new technologies into the courtroom affects the right of each individual to a fair trial," Thomas J said. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court, rejected the motions by decision last week briefly and succinctly when he said the New Media would be "carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word on this matter.
For decades, court appeals have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its 1966 historic decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath from Cleveland who is said to have killed his wife, overturned and said in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the new media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals, which Mr. Looking at Haye's conviction half a century later, might follow the argument that new rules have become necessary to get the lines of communication from the courtroom that were at the time of the Dr. Sheppard was still unimaginable to settle.
"There is a good reason to be alarmed about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," John J said. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who investigated the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it is arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts may be fascinated by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many that Mr.'s lawyers Hayes set out to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been prejudged when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them grisly crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her fancier, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have filled her with disgust.
Defense lawyers say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge had mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he would have inadmissibly put pressure on the verdict when he had made the unusual decision to put the jury free over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
Yet their arguments about the influence of extensive coverage of the process are perhaps attracting the most interest.
In a sentencing appeal they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was being discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the office of governor and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotions over the case.
"Such a daily rush of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "one has not experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter's coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that this direct messages were more incitement than reports being made more slowly was an anti-technical look that impoverished reporting on future processes.
Yet some lawyers said appeal courts would often face the argument that societal and technical changes require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers reinforce that claim.
In their objection, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court's decision in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted due to the coverage and made it clear that the New Media requires new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st. century."
Can courtesy connect the separating?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before quickly returning to the struggle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and leaders of Congress did not bring a breakthrough on the big issues that one had to deal with during the so-called "lame duck session," the session at the end of a government period in which no more decisions were made.
After all that one hears, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a consideration of their shared responsibility to govern, but rather an empty episode of a partisan points-collecting.
The public meeting of the president's deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months creates a mutual respect that obscures the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
This is hardly enough to claim that a new era of cooperation has dawned.
The two sides are now in a test phase - in which one of the other demands signs of cooperation and compromise, while one tries to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of the voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting itself and its assessment by participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and too deep to expect a rapid change in the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it's taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election was a mild vote for Washington, at least for a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
“This is inevitable after elections.
Elections awaken partisan passions that die again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or even all, whether temporarily or permanently.
Likewise, a compromise on increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe the favored tax cuts for the rich, while they deny support to unemployed workers.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, the optimism has increased that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time also ratify the New START Treaty.
Yet William Glaston of the Brookings Institution warns that a successful collaboration on urgent issues of the lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties if the new 112. Congress will be convened in January.
Instead, he says, a period of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - which leads courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what happens from today until 2012, as pre-fighting, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have a lot to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served to form them.
However concerned Republican leaders may be about pokering too high, they know they need to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health care reform.
These party lines are already evident in the initial reactions regarding the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as raising the retirement age and lowering government spending.
Deputy Chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have been so pushing to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that they can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan for official recommendation and they are fighting very hard to get even close to that number.
The greatest resistance is found in the elected representatives of the body, since in financial matters, at least today, there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes and health care system, followed later by a period of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
The public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they appear to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the Congressional Republicans than it was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure foreplay for a much more far-reaching election in 2012.
Viewed this way, the courtesy that is being displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes on a part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. Thus, in February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are extorting high protection money so they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They collect money not only from legitimate business, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every layer of the bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - takes its part of the money that wanders the ladder up.
The memo, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted on its home page by WikiLeaks on Tuesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that in the meantime it would have been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied allegations of corruption over years, and he has won numerous slander lawsuits against such accusations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt. This is what surveys have revealed.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individual persons are called, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct link of Moscow's government with crime has led some to call it "disturbed" and conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government," according to the memo.
“Criminal elements enjoy a “kryshna” (a term from the world of criminals/mafia, which literally means “roof” or protection) that extends across the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Experts have discovered a three-layer structure within Moscow's criminal world.
“Luzhkov is at the top.”
“FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage.”
“Recently, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level.”
“This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city offers no help whatsoever.”
The report goes on to say that the FSB collects money from the biggest companies and that the police arrest small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "declared that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
“For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be.”
The memo notes that while collecting the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very modest; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who do not pay find their business very quickly closed - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Im, a Moscow expert commission, said in a recent interview.
“But he is part of that bureaucracy.”
“It’s not a part of the political class because a political class no longer exists in Russia.”
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, according to Imm, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a more recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (Countries are listed from "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memo of the American Embassy, which happened late in the evening after Moscow, will certainly trigger displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused of Moscow’s mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policy in this country," he said.
“But to be honest, we didn’t expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know.”
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and peeling walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, the later Khmer Rouge guide Ta Mok.
“Everyone here loves Ta Mok.”
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Because of its brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwest Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
Yet this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed the victims to publicly confront the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that tells the story of the Khmer Rouge to children of former soldiers for the first time.
And in July, a community tribunal of the UN and Cambodia first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Veng, complicating their efforts for reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodia's society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Centre, an independent organization that is researching the regime.
“For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.”
“It divides families itself.”
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died from disease, overwork or from hunger.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the regime's remnants and its military fled to Thailand's border.
Here they spread until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered, unrest.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-promoted peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to government, leading to the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he waited for his trial.
When their patrons no longer protected them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few military officials of the Khmer Rouge retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
“They are anchored in the regime’s utopian agricultural ideology.”
“They grew up without any professional knowledge.”
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Annang Veng before settling in 1998 to live a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
“Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat.”
“But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves.”
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
That has done little to mitigate fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in the province of Manteay Meanchey during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she had told representatives of the Cambodia Documentation Center that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced labourers were believed to have died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem came back from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass Im Chaem declined to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court subpoena her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and stability," she said.
“If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain if the court would indict more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Centre.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that how everything can understand.”
The center created the first government-approved school book about the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the history book for the Ministry of Education's high school, which contains less than four pages across the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people in Anlong Veng know very little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years old, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new schoolbook helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
“They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people are convicted by the court.”
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the schoolbook and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
At the top of the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a pile of tires.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone saleswoman, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she will drop off a bush of ripe bananas - hoping he'll bring her happiness.
Belarus agrees to continue accumulating weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement after a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article in the security summit.
The U.S. government had spent years trying to convince Belarus to not collect highly enriched uranium and appeared to have reached a hurdle last spring.
Yet officials from the U.S. government told The Washington Post that two secret agreements with Belarus have been made in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about £500, according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the issue's sensitivity.
The agreement appears to be one of the key findings of Obama's "nuclear security summit of the 47 nations" from April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really excited by the fact that they want a seat in the Nuclear Security Summit (of 2012).”
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important step" by Belarus.
Obama promised in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the George W government. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear safety summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How to retain highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... We’re not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we’re not going to sell it to anyone.”
“We use it exclusively for research purposes, that’s all.”
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in the meeting of a deal.
The first attempt to remove the uranium of Belarus in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that was more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for this effort, with much of the money going into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium that cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on global risk reduction.
The James Martin Centre for Non-Proliferable Studies estimates that Belarus has had at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012, according to the joint agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
“Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announces that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential to the progress of the country and its citizens,” she explains.
No objections from the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objections to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners across Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents enveloped by WikiLeaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (by cable). It is added that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to demonstrate that foreign aircraft flying over Spain will be adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe indicting aid to human rights-contempt practices in a dozen countries, including Spain, former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy prime minister admitted that the Council's report "met Zapatero in the offing" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
“De la Vega underlined that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory.”
"You just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports by cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, although the government has little influence, since these are in the hands of the judges."
Prosecutor Vicente González, for his part, told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not block the judicial initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Intelligence Headquarters (CNI) and the Secretary of Defense on the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Even so, the U.S. was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and the German prosecutors" than about the declassified information from the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle governments," Aguirre laments.
At a lunch in March 2007 attended by U.S. Ambassador and Spanish Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were insanely keen on their independence and did what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to let the tension subside."
The ambassador also expressed his concern about the PP's approach to the matter.
"Despite their generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, from an indication that the administration of Zapatero's actions of the U.S. that could have been interpreted as possible human rights violations will capitalize or deliberately ignore, even if these revelations could have a negative impact on the U.S. government," he points out.
The child murderer confesses that she had complained on the Internet about the "toil" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when she was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the Internet.
Under this epithet, which she leads from an early age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both are from Noia, a village in La Coruña province where she was born.
The notices are from 2008.
To understand these, one must know their love life, which the daily ABC reconstructs on the basis of testimony from their family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman established a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it was revealed that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his alumn never let him do a DNA analysis.
Shortly after, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the job market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love relationship broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca, writing: "Alberto is very peculiar and pissed because I came here to work."
“When I told him this, he found it good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be able to do and leave what he wants.”
She later mentions a message she has just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send you to the boy."
She complains: "If he doesn't like that I leave the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I get back."
In May, she talks about returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm only going to stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a work on the 20th if I don't want to lose those."
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her if all goes well.
“He’ll be with whoever he has to be, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone but my mother again," a dubious intention when considering their bad relationship.
There is another email in July.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy, who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th, is dead.
“On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand, not.”
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the place a little bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day.”
She's talking about moving to Mallorca.
“There he (the boy) will attend a summer class, so I have less expenses for the nanny.”
On the 17th: Memories and Complaints.
"A huge kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
“Alberto says he emailed me any videos. You see, if he wants to, he finds me, such a crap."
On the 30th another: "The boy is fine. He goes into a summer class to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting me money."
On the Internet, in anime and mangablogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked up, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison lacker."
"Terror a la gallega (headline) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn-in hunting guard, declares to have remorse for feeling guilty.
He can't believe that everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to Palma's provincial prison yesterday by the Centre for Prisoners of Court in Menorca.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, stated that she could not remember the course of the facts, "and she had no intention of harming the little one."
Previously, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutors requested a psychiatric opinion.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28. November, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and MPs in the last regional elections, the PP is already turning its gaze to the parliamentary elections - preferred or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party achieves in these elections is usually twice as high as those in Catalonia's elections.
Thus, the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while this figure was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising trend - the result of the redirection of the vote share of the PSC and the binding of the electorate of the PP - should continue, the analysts of the PP predict that in the general elections the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while also CiU four (it has 10) and the PSC would lose at least 9 deputies (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the People's Party's analysis, the ERC would lose one MP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its MP or win one in.
However, should the election calendar be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections will fall into May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) may be the tongue on the scales to put an end to socialist supremacy, in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: €661 million for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, in which the Socialists can neither achieve a majority nor draw on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd that this party will lose its representation on the Barcelona local council, in which it would have to score 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, saw an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they will be able to play the lead role in Tarragona's turnaround. There they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with the PP.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
The People’s Party also recorded a significant increase in other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and strives to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell worried Al Qaeda of thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerians arrested by the police of the Barcelona Police Department formed the jihadist cell controlled by Thailand, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement for the Liberation of Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the assassinations in Bombay, which claimed 106 dead in 2008.
The Spanish Minister of the Interior assigns great importance to these investigations, which goes so far that he assures that with "Operation Kampai" the forgery apparatus of Al Qaeda has been "weakened" worldwide and thus "their ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups from which the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda is composed, so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigation. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks in the territory of the EU in the next few days as the one carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was arrested in Thailand, where the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt, as well as the Thais were arrested.
They had run the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been nullified in 2009 - stole tourist passports in particular in accordance with the specifications of the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents were issued in the name of men aged 25 to 45 and still had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In investigation circles, it is emphasized that until now no connections could be detected between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination attempt in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, "Laschkar e-Taiba" was one of the recipient groups of the passports stolen in Spain and subsequently faked in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination attempt from Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" that put an end to the lives of 106 people.
The police have seized extensive documentation.
PP demands from Mas an adjournment of tax agreement
The PPC's chairwoman, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, took the opportunity yesterday to personally present Artur Mas with her conditions in support of his taking office as prime minister of the Generalitat. These are no different from those already set during the election campaign and can be combined with the primacy of the economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement, which the regionalist leader intends to propose at the height of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party turned with security to Artur Mas, who awarded her the 18 deputies she had won last Sunday - a digit more than sufficient to feel indispensable. Because the candidate of the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on the fact that at least one of the opposition parties abstains in the vote when he took office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entente with the PP. However, the talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders revolve around Catalonia.
As for the party leaders of the PPC, it calls for "all discourses affecting Catalonia's sovereignty and independence" as well as an agreement on financial equalization between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which even wants to submit to a referendum to the party leader of CiU.
Both political leaders have in common that they want to make the built-up political apparatus of the regional administration leaner and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations for Mas to take office are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The elderly care home reaffirms that the deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the retirement home in Olot do not rule out that their carer killed over eleven elderly people
Those in charge of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they highlighted the damage the criminal acts of Joan Vila Dilmé - the carer who had killed at least eleven old people for whom he was in charge of during his work - had caused the facility.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat would like to indict the person responsible (for the deaths)," but "the law and our liability force us to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a loss of social reputation, because it had not determined the criminal acts of the carer in time, but now also pay a large amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder ever since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the nursing home for the elderly - as he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and diseases.
The head of La Caritatt denied this point roundly, explaining that "missing measures could not have been the reason for the incidents at any time."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the litigation, there was no evidence of negligent acts by a person other than the accused."
The already christened as the "angel of death" confessed eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared that the first crime on the 29th. August 2009 and murdered the second old lady a month and a half later.
In this case, he killed with an overdose of insulin, in contrast to the first crime, in which he had administered a mixture of different sedatives.
The head of La Caritat said staff's access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The nurse used the insulin syringes and the sedative cocktail in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients with death from their suffering.
But the results of the lab's tests will highlight whether Vila was lying and actually chose a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned it out from within by giving them bleach liquor, as he had done according to confession in three women, whom he between the 12th and 17th. October murdered.
In La Caritat, one does not believe the statements of the nurse, not even as far as the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course of action after eight successful murders.
They say they made them available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank (ECB) threatening gestures
Investors yesterday reacted sharply to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned that "markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk premiums of eurozone peripheral countries have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be mistaken and that the euro has barely increased in terms of points, which leads to concern.
Yesterday's events are typical of an illiquid market, which is recovering to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor will not lose his fear.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank called on us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB must withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank called for the termination of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as these were ineffective, as well as the cancellation of all extraordinary temporary liquidity measures. Only a one-week indefinite access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and to maintain quarterly tenders with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity until at least June.
We also expect that the program to purchase bonds will continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday will be thrown back again and if stiff-staringly insistens that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
Just as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the bank reiterated not considering buying government debt and markets subsequently collapsed, this story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, provoking a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year state titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State wealth management spent only 500 million at 5.28%, up from 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points across the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets in the words of Trichet.
In Ireland, the figures of the debt hole of Allied and Bank of Ireland have been published.
The sum is estimated at approximately 10 000 million in the short term and possible another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks are being nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the issue with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help to lessen uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary approval of its new budget next Tuesday. Since it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has her discourse with regard to the summit of heads of state and government on 14. December more moderately designed. Political unity is required there to show that we play the same score together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish government president yesterday presented the action plan, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has gained 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the response from the government and the Spanish central bank was swift and convincing, and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a major auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. Therefore, we are counting on a strong demand that will remove all doubts about our debt restructuring capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The Treasury has €40 billion at its disposal, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are exceedingly expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only being, but also appearance counts."
Courage, we can do it!
The Chairman of the Board of Eulen contests the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia at the request of his children
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owners of the Owls and El Enebro societies, does not slacken.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate group, will contest the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will be held on the 16th at the request of five of his seven children, as he considers them "absolutely void." His children will try to obtain a majority to control the administrative organs of the company - owner of the winery Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be willing to give in in his legal battle over controlling the organs of El Enebro.
He was driven out of the board of directors by five of his seven children. These were appointed at the shareholder meeting of 18. January of this year, which is already registered in the Commercial Register as contested, to members of the Board of Directors.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of Madrid's Commercial Court number 2 for the 16th, has sparked a new thunderbolt in the lap of the Álvarez family.
The invocation of the judge to arrange the assembly is the only legal way that ensures the convocation of the shareholders' meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "despairs means of the applicants - his five children - to, by means of legal ingenduities, fraudulent machinations and abuse of law, the Assembly of 18, which was declared invaid. To have January acknowledged," as official spokespersons explain.
This argument is the basis for contesting the assembly in hindsight to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists, who wrap themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - asset company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use over 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the matter that the judge has to decide on in the hearing on the handling of the contestation action, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved with software in real time.
Since the 2004 Red Bull invaded the world of Formula One, their history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply rising career during the last seasons, everyone relied on the victory of the Ferrari of Fernando Alonso at the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the power of Renault's engine, the "secret weapon" that the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, it is a powerful software for simulating processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer science program, known as PLM, has been used for the development of assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to provide a faithful reproduction or Simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements detected at the races and in the tests can design and execute.
Russwurm explains that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Red Bull's team employs 180 highly qualified young people today. With powerful computer systems, they perform analyses and all possible changes to the race car.
The Siemens manager said the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all the components of Red Bull's race cars, with the exception of the engine for which Renault is solely responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set for this crazy technical perfectionism is the $40 million that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on its races in a season.
Red Bull has set up its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a site 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are severely limited.
All that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts at the services of its participation on the racetracks, hide other protagonists whose support is invaluable and whose awareness is equal to zero.
The plant's chief of technology, Steve Nevey, stresses that five years ago it was still possible to say that progress in R&D for race cars contributed 50 percent to the victory and the pilots were in charge of the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of the success, while the contribution of pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by IT, because they "are unpredictable gladiators."
HP will open twenty of its own stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of a sales network consisting of twenty stores, each with 80 to 100 square meters, which the Multi intends to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company agrees this initiative with the already existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España's vice-chairwoman, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, 20 of which are branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third store.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming new openings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-chairwoman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. She is relying on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises these and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the store staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and highlighted that the exclusive outlet network intends to "optimize customer service and advice to small and micro-enterprises on purchasing and after, even packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneering pilot program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
“This way, we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days.”
"This system was developed in particular for small and micro enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," explained Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'steal' his rival a million customers in three years'
Banco Sabadell's executive board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Despite this, he foresees a slump in interest rates that banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and prices for loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a subject that is still too existing.
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year guidance plan in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking advantage of the public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000, if you deduct the customers that the bank will lose. This is the big challenge facing this bank, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the business plan 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges the bank faces with this will be presented together with the annual report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has confused all the plans of the banks worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its Optima four-year guidance plan this year. This was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with long reach."
The manager assumes Spain would only come out of the crisis "slowly."
Also, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of banks.
Even if he assumes that the war for liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will slow down, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks have to pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity are already passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
“The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans.”
"We didn't turn the tap off, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto on Thursday already issued the order to its branch network to restrict the granting of long-term loans and increase interest rate differentials (cf. Cinco Días of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the stategy of "increasing fees", but "within a competition-driven framework ".
Sabadell's guardrail is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not rule out corporate business.
Not for nothing, he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"In the coming year, everything will change," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "enormously" increasing and does not rule out the possibility that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red.
He is of the opinion that the FROB can replace the money market in the event of capital increases.
After assuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he invalidates the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be put into circulation, but in contrast to the incidents in June, one could achieve short-term financing via repo transactions and thus intercept the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers of savings banks
The Director General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a wave of mergers of the savings banks and emphasized the speed with which the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process of the Spanish savings banks began, several savings banks insisted on not participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the general director of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
“I believe that most of the mergers are complete. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but rather adjustments."
“The majority is completed. We may have thirteen or fourteen instead of seventees, but all the important processes are already completed. They were controlled by Banco de España, which strongly supported all operations."
At a breakfast organized by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "consummated as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely process, which was determined in earlier times, not now, in the context of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
“The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel Agreement," he emphasized.
Olavarrieta explained that "there would be a series of unabashed opinions about the slowness of the process, the dubiousness and nonsense," because "Banco de España exhorts us to conclude in time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems in Europe and "perhaps" of the whole world, adding that those who doubted this would do so "without deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that in the current economic situation, we do not have to worry about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, which have undergone a "very significant" concentration process that would be carried out "as soon as possible."
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests that the ECB conducted in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the maintenance of the euro, but at the same time has set conditions for the whole of the European Union.
The tensions in the markets have triggered a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment companies or the cancellation of the 426 euros of support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent from AENA, the management of the Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, who has conjured the current crisis.
How to understand these processes?
It is anticipated that Merkel's position is not a mistake of her public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany is taking a fundamentally new perspective to shape our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of much of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, there are three possible ways out of the crisis in Germany.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction -, supported by much of the public opinion, ca. 50% of the population.
The third: a transformation of the euro according to German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that pass the requirements; possibly the payment of some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adjustment measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. Therefore, there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled out of its sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
That was the first sign of the drifting apart between what Germany thought necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign set the Central European country when Merkel painfully pushed out the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was heavily criticized. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, public and published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel comes out again in the last days of October with a clear position. It calls for a reform of the European Union's agreements to allow the rescue of a country while requiring private lenders to bear part of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it advanced the Irish crisis and all of the following.
But their proposal, though somewhat sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which is to enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross it.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures now have to be taken - there will no longer be the old way of working of the euro from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the opposing countries can be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector must cover part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement of productivity and competitiveness, and positive foreign economic balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, just as it was cited by Spain in boom times, will simply not be accepted.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly about not understanding it.
It's not just about cutting the government deficit to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do in these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will pass into more calm.
And that we will use the opportunities that are offered to us by the spring of 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) indicates that despite the criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in her own house has prepared her way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything would change about that.
Among the possibilities envisaged, the fact that we would have to leave the euro area, which is full of scarce countries, cannot be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it warned us.
Sport and environment
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to bypass a sanction.
The alleged exclusion in the match of 23, which was allegedly instigated by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) November against the Ajax in the Champions League led to a lot of ink being shed about whether or not it was an unsportsmanlike act and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead its group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary commission punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with varying amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is rather common in the world of football.
It is so prevalent that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but in this sport followed rules.
Part of the debate about the presented case is due to the fact that a team from the Real Madrid football club (who, in his anthem, pretended to be noble and honor and, on other occasions, had punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role, and to the dramatization by Mourinho, who added one episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this practice, which is not expressly prohibited by the statutes, contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these acts constitute a rule circumvention. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of the sport, but seem to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sportsmanship should be investigated.
The sportsman defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not jeopardized by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the infringing players from taking an unjustified benefit from the opposing team. This, too, did not happen.
The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by false play or circumvention, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible for it to be punished by the referee.
The players waited and joyfully accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the infringers pulled out of the deliberate fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was neither put in a less favorable position nor benefits for the game played were required, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue to play with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that the players will begin the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, as the team could also retire at some point. In addition, players receive a sanction with this procedure and move into the second card cycle, in which they are eliminated less than in the first cycle because of card accumulation with a card.
With that said, it's not so clear whether it's really an advantage.
Ultimately, such approaches are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions in order to derive the greatest possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to avoid a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of regular circumvention), they wanted to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without dodging or fleeing from it.
Although the line between inventiveness and the rule environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic was created as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transmission.
The damage done to the principles of sport through these actions is less ethical than aesthetic.
Offer offensive to catch customers for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year leaves an avalanche of reservations to days 16. and 17. December fall.
The celebrations paid for by employees themselves are spreading. You don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to Christmas, which feed the Barcelona restaurant and leisure industry oxygen. But as a result of the economic crisis, they are triggering a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which represents the large mass: almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations confirm.
So that the accounting becomes even more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has all orders into the week of 13. Dropping December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations of dinner on two peak days (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have ceased group dinners for household reasons.
In order not to have to do without this tradition, many employees pay for it out of their own pocket.
However the economy is, lowest prices are demanded, confirms the Chairman of the Barcelona Restaurant Board, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella association does not dare to predict what the holidays will look like this month.
“People think about it ‘teny times before they make a reservation.”
"They would like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he insists.
The business will go well with those who "offer the quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers are saving in times of crisis, which is why prices are the most in demand around 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of the 17. December's leading providers to collapse.
The Soteras group says the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The Group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
With another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 restaurants in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from early November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain last year's prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locales, one does not lose optimism after revenues have been flourishing again since the second quarter and good, if focused on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are being looked forward to.
Sources from the group of companies highlight that the 18th will also be an overactive day with groups of friends celebrating Christmas.
To the six group menus, a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more has been added as a price hit. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, too, you can see green sprouts, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group meals are back on the upswing.
On the part of the umbrella association Fecasarm (with mergers such as the pub, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel on it and notes that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "smash out a maximum".
However, the fun of celebrating has not declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises great concern in the US
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
WikiLeaks revelations confirm Taliban-Pakian relations.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Internet portal WikiLeaks, confirms the enormous concerns of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the verge of clarifying and juicy details that the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security is not being stepped up, but, on the contrary, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country is producing more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in the event of a possible attack - are preparing Washington sleepless nights.
The following risks are counted by the Ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of former National Security Council head James Jones, on: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed scattering of nuclear material and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer considered to be sprawling and reason to exercise caution not only by the US, but also by Russia.
"Pakistan must hire strictly devout personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and cultural, extremist organizations have more opportunities to reclust individuals working on nuclear or missile programs," expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
What is new about the documentary revealed by Julian Assange’s internet portal is that U.S.-Pakistan cooperation on nuclear proliferation is diminishing and the increased pace at which Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" is declared: "Often there is no transparency; on offers of help we receive no answers or they are rejected."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, official of the state intelligence agency for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as any other country."
Ambassador Patterson asks Washington during a visit by the chief army leader, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to those responsible that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for WikiLeak's boss
Obama appoints a high leader in the fight against terrorism to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red warning to prosecute and find Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth in which the facts are difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" about the "finding and prosecution" of Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order to be arrested.
Besides, it's not new, it's from 20. November.
It also has nothing to do with the latest revelation of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
The lawyer for WikiLeaks’ founder, Mark Stephens, “proofers would know where and how to contact Mr. Assange.”
Already on the 20th, the international police authority based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
That's how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and find Assange "to provisionally arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, many member countries consider the red warning, according to the organization, as a free pass for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The crackdown outraged Assange's lawyers, who, yesterday, published a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer the Swedish authorities' questions via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the departure from Sweden and was compared to the prosecutor, who is being compared to the legendary Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin, the corresponding approval.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution," the letter is charged.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia asserts her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an unknown place, but not in silence.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location. At the meeting, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value the opinion of a guy with a website," he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior leader in the fight against the counterterrorism, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document disclosures.
President Barack Obama's attempt by Speaker Barack Obama's attempt to pay less attention to Assange is in contrast to the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are announcing these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives from January, has called on the state department to investigate the possibility of putting WikiLeaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and pursue anyone who supports them or contributes."
Tom Flanagan, adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to revoke his statement that Assange must be "murdered."
“Obama would have to turn him into a target and use a non-manned plane or something.”
Those who did not apologize were Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was who leaked information in the government, he is guilty of betrayal and all that is not an execution is too mild a punishment," he told Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carode
The Republican leader allows the party a secret ballot on his continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the principle of the General Assembly.
Joan Puigcercós appears to have found a recipe to avoid directionless ERC for the tenth time of an internal turmoil in the ranks of the after the loss of 11 MPs and half of the electoral votes.
The party chairman is aware that his threat of resignation is not enough for the close associates of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as its mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
That is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win over the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the start, it announced yesterday that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could speak secretly about his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with an upscale hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would not feel vindicated with half the votes plus one, and he added without specifying percentages, a result "in Bulgarian style" would not be good either.
The Carod closest to the President demand more than just to provide his office to the party. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to push for resignations, they will agree a plan of action with the board from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will present to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, he is to promise to move the Congress forward to the fall of 2011, which the party leader already considers a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" harms stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article that the incumbent Conseller Josep Huguet signed on his blog is symptomatic.
In view of the fact that Puigcercós is an ideologue, the owner of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman was supported "in exchange for various goals".
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that ERC should finally abandon the General Assembly principle as a working method.
In doing so, he advocates a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates.
From the end of the full assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - Puigcercós' team, which already fought for it at the last two congresses, is obsessed.
In fact, at the quaking 2008 assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the principle of General Assembly at a congress that was supposed to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, as infogle was not advisable to address this matter of internal resolve in recent years.
Now, without the critical sectors are in wait, the time may have come to revisit this matter and conclude it forever.

Next to him, police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
The representative of China stated at COP16 that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprints and it would maintain its supply to mine 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China considers its supply to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, assures Su Wei, the representative of this country at COP16.
At his first public appearance on the 16. United Nations World Climate Summit (COP16) assured Su Wei that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprints and transform its industry.
He said that over the past four years, his country has invested $245 million to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
On the other hand, he stated that China would not change its goals, but would work on this matter together with the international community.
He explained that the Chinese climate change strategy is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of the reduction of gas emissions, he said.
On the other hand, he emphasized that in China, the authorities of the states had cooperated with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the energy saving, effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
In addition, he said, several multi-year plans have already been tackled or completed, both those funded by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he referred to the Energy Effective Use Programme, which has been introduced over the past five years and had received investment from the United Nations (UN), the government and from private hands.
There is also a provincial-level project on climate change, another to exchange traditional light bulbs through energy-saving bulbs and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China’s efforts were far greater than would be commonly thought.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China is six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy effectiveness has been increased by twenty percent over the past five years and another is expected to happen by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN declared that the former panist party chairman had the right to contact the National Commission of Order and demand what the right would be for him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barriento was right and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right would be for him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint was made by Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he explained that the exclusion of Espino was a decision that had been made at the local level.
“This is an independent decision of the Order Commission in Sonora.”
"Mr. Espino has the right, in his case, to contact the Comisión de Order del Consejo Nacional on the basis of the complaint, so that a decision is made by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional strengthened from the internal vote on the next 4th and 5. December, at which his successor is elected, would emerge.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposal for the municipal election, he was successful and served his purpose," he elaborated.
The panist leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, therefore "the internal competition does not terrify us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the best chairman that Acción Nacional needed for the next three years. Therefore, he would hand over the relays "to the one whom the council would determine."
“I’m completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer the office of party chairman to each of the five of them."
He predicted that the one in the last election of the 4th. July recorded upswing in the party will be reflected in the next elections, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
“Now it’s about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task.”
In this context, he emphasized that the three governments that emerged from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed throughout the country. This is why "a lot of hopes and longings are placed in them and I'm sure Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón for his disc course as part of his four-year government, César Nava called on supporters of the PRI to reflect on the six-year period of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should they start defending them should they finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He is of the opinion that the holder of the federal government expresses such as those he can make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no mouth ban and even less a censorship.
Obama campaigns in Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
"If you are in favor of the passage of the Dream Act law, then call your senators and push for the passage of this law," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - Law on Legalizing Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social web Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act law, then call on your senators and push for the passage of this bill," Obama tweeted.
His briefing includes a cyberlink to a more extensive document calling on the public to get in touch with their senators, as the bill's vote is imminent.
"With your voice waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he insists.
The news was circulated after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax reductions from Bush's time and government funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects such as ratifying the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the blockade of Republicans of the law Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue was resolved, a timetable could be set for the remaining projects.
“I think we still have a lot of time...”
“We all agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year...”
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and after that we can plan the expiration of the rest," he said.
Senate Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced Tuesday that "he would request the vote to end the debate" so that the Dream Act bill, which could be used to vote on the initiative to legalize undocumented students in the Senate from next Thursday, although next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act law, or the Law of the American Dream, would legalize approximately 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, have lived in this country for the past five years and are enrolled in a higher education institution or with the Army.
But the law's advocates need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organising an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against it and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support for the law.
That's why the defenders of the Dream Act need to get several Republicans on their side in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
The most courted Republicans include those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida Senator George Lemieux, who took over the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they said they would no longer support it on another occasion.
Another Republican who had advocated for the law, John McCain, has yet to establish his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'Die Lust an der Sprache' was a walk in which the participants stood up for the narrative
“I understand the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event, the round table was dedicated to sex in language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "puts us in trouble," the Argentine scripture spit sweetly towards the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, in which Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcí.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and which Shultz afterwards characterized as a great narrative. Luisa recounts in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking to learn what a "wound" is, and goes from doctor to doctor, of which she does not receive an answer, but receives clues for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectious disease scientist convinced: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the aisle, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs in relief and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both of them.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a delightful narrative, which he called 'Praise of Invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to the magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back far-traveled men, or who restored virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a U-turn and reported on America, the great novel that did not lack its own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticized the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
“Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), scoffed the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as true, but in other ways the story of America would never have been told—with imagination, which even lost the sense of shame.”
However, he emphasizes that "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lie approach each other, where one no longer knows which side the narrative belongs to, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'tradition Cervante'.
“From him we have inherited to be what is being told.”
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the invitation of the FIl to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican woman dedicated her contribution to the great wound of social violence that infesses her country - like the whole of Latin America - as a result of the struggles for drug trafficking.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned commitment," she explained, after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that builds between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the committed writer in the writer's wound."
He noted that in a fast-paced world, intellectual habits and the control of consciousness also boil down to dogmatisms, and it is forgotten "that behind every confirmation there is a small no and behind every denial a little yes."
“In order to be in possession of our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: and nuancers often mean putting their finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of cartoons, in black and white, in ready-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful, who prefer to divide the world into black and white again.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the final, two different styles are also opposed by their respective coaches, and their encounter, which is characterized by contrasts, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held up well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine has played himself up to the second champion with the medal, he has fallen one step behind the winners and, amazingly, he has played consecutive finals with the same team.
The santistic strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a major defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, at the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, as the game with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of draw, but at the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two opportunities to pocket his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned 4.
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be pursued again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break a statistic, that's for a club, for my affection, to which I indulge, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the helmsman commented when asked about the lost finals.
The last final game has remained strongly in his memory, he assures to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared at the line, the players are also, because the last time we were already prepared with two penalty kicks to retire, and I believe that this is not a lesson, until the game is not finished."
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootout does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shoot-out, you want to finish in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately, fate did not prepare us a bad game, sometimes as a result of nervousness or the fierce effort to keep the title already in our hands,will come."
It is in Romanso’s power to no longer just be a second champion and, for the first time, to taste the fame that the titles bring.
The US is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
Persons must present themselves at the consulate before their interview at the service centres for visa application; costs are thus shortened.
From the 10. January 2011, procedures for applying for a visa changed at the United States Embassy and in the consulates.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves at the visa application service centres (ASC, the initial letters in English) before their interview in the consulate.
The staff of the ASC shall take up the applicant's biometric data, which will be reviewed by the consulate prior to the interview.
The new procedure has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases, because it is no longer necessary to pay the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out separately.
The applicant shall only make a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the return on $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and $390 for hands and investors.
Those who only want to extend their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves at the nearest ASC, where they present their documents and their fingerprints are taken.
Since the biometric data is obtained in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for the interview in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those who apply for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the $26 service surcharge.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure can be found in the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA Announces the Find of Alien Life
The North American space agency convened a press conference to present a find tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) announces an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday, that could confirm the theory of the existence of extraterrestrial life.
The find will be presented tomorrow at 13.00 at a press conference at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology. This is a science that studies the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured it would present "a prudential find for the search for alien life," sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there may be human-like creatures in hostile environments that were previously thought uninhabitable. The hypothesis was raised that these could transform into intelligent living beings - just like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently, it's a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. It lives there in an environment that has been considered too toxic for all conceivable life forms, since the lake is strongly arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses the arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances are increasing that there could be similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere.
When these organisms metabolize the arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actual another life form, a second life form, which is different from the one known to us."
The space agency announces tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference the actual range of its find.
The conference will be attended by the geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars, and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists who studies Titan (the largest moon of Saturn) under the question of whether its chemical composition resembles the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they complain.
Just had the 60. Legislature began, and already an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, who introduced himself as an independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
before the start of the introductory session in the 60. Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo opposed the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones voting against the Bureau led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as vice-chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the parties PRI and PAN had institutionally introduced their political front position with these reforms.
He stated that over the next few days they would speak to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they proceeded from their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated again by both parties, which would put an end to the opposition coalition.
“So far I come here (the opposition coalition), that’s what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions that do not even consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that therefore a pluralistic group would be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, having been monopolistic, is now supposed to be "duopolistic."
“It is not the spirit of legislative reform that a perpetual two-party system is to rule in Congress.”
"For the beginning, this group starts with five MPs and they are talking to other colleagues so that they become more," the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, alluding to PAN and PRI, said that Congress had currently turned into a 'prey' for two.
“Before, it was just one party, now they divide it up for two.”
Patrón Montalvo requested that the MPs be respected and that they be assigned their place at the negotiating tables.
"It must not be left out because of top decisions five, which are likely to be nine MPs. The Five, who are currently seen as being divided into different factions, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of it reform, which was carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we disagree with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
The city administration of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical material.
Another cheque for just over 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city administration.
Thus, the sum paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company for electrical material amounts to 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144.56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued last 16. November with the purpose of "billing of open invoices" issued.
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent ahead that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at excessive prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total sum still owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it's just paid the debt, just like with the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "resurfaced" in the final quarter of the year: 24. September, two of the 15th. October, 19. October, 29. October and this last of the 16. November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, when a company is questioned by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting their services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste on 25. July the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers had published, it became known that already, from March 2008 to the 9th. July 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she chequed over 3 million peso worth checks.
Tourist places must be improved in urgency
Tourist companies regret the foreign tourist's accident as a result of the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the burglary of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the merchants' association of the Zona Dorada, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to turn the poor conditions that tourists find into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had had a negative effect, as the tourists would come to the stroll and saw the clutter, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
“The politicians don’t know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don’t worry about how much money you lose. Because otherwise they would not carry out the construction work slowly and without a plan in this way."
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the fall of the tourist had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and the lack of maintenance on the part of the city.
“The community must take on its responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How is she supposed to do that? Well, through preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything afterwards," he explained.
“We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean habitat. The city administration needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
“Today, we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in shot," he added.
“Not enough attention has been paid to these arrangements and these kinds of incidents expose what is obvious to everyone: maintenance is urgently needed.”
Raúl Llera Martínez, undersecretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not properly used and gave a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore along with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
“Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first need to be cleaned up and cleaned in order to make them attractive for tourism and to supply them with to the inventory with which we promote this destination.
IP demands results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a role model for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
The corporate industry of Mazatlán calls for a dignified parliament, free of collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60. Parliament inaugurated. It is composed of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three by Partido Nueva Alianza, two by PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and yet another from PVEM. This makes a total of 40 representatives of the people.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to be committed to society and to the various social groups that depend on responsible parliamentary work, and that the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism are not repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE Entrepreneurs' Coordination Council, suggested that the new MPs should take on the great responsibility of setting a role model for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
“We hope that MPs really exercise their right to act freely from collusion between the parties, for it is customary for them to make agreements with which they represent their own interests, with which they transform themselves into carnival extremisms of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary factions.”
He spoke of the fact that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
“We take care that they do a trustworthy work and, above all, are committed to society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their confidence in them in the last elections.”
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, believes that one of the major challenges faced by the 40 representatives of the people is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
“The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in some way promote job creation.”
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new Members to allocate the necessary importance in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism.
“I understood that it is the ministry with the second fewest means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry.”
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the Alcohol Act, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be updated.
Holy King is wanted
Dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys are eagerly desired by the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
On the next Day of the Three Kings, it will be difficult for the parents to fulfill these wishes, because the household is composed no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and the garments they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the Salvador Allende settlement. They live from hand to mouth, for the Father has no permanent job.
“Sometimes hard times are times because my husband doesn’t have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the brats to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
The ten-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes in the size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I would like this monster so much', but I answered him, 'Let's wait, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were at school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe has size 12; the ten-year-old Isaías is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
14-year-old José Juan lacks tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie were carried out as part of the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estrie.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were said to have mainly served drug manufacturing.
"About 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," said Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for the Quebec Security Police.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of the men, who are considered the main wire pullers of the drug ring, are from Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons are said to have appeared in front of the justice building in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with accusing the production of cannabis, their possessions for sales, plot and service of crime.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigative activity that took place for over a year.
"The information received from public authorities has allowed us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel.
Around 70 officers of the regional investigation unit Estria of the Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could easily be pursued
The Conservatives' bill, which according to the government is supposed to address the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, is expected to be stunned after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
“I strongly oppose this Charter.”
"I'm holding with a party that has put shackles on your feet," Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, declared after the weekly caucus meeting in front of the assembled MPs.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows any seagoing vessel identified as to be used to transport illegal immigrants to be held for up to a year, violates the Canadian legal and freedom constitution as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he could not support the bill, as he opposes the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing," M explained. Duceppe.
The criticism regarding the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, has dismissed the critics, who demand that their party does not behave steadfastly enough towards the secret immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree that measures are taken against the blind passengers, and this is exactly what we are trying to enforce by mediating another draft law, the C-35," said Chow.
We therefore do not endorse the Conservatives' bill because it seeks blame among the refugees and keeps children captive for at least a year," Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
“The Canadians strongly inform MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal processes that affect Canada and that treat the country like a footman.”
"They expect Canada to take tough action," according to the reaction of Minister Kenney.
“The government has not announced a vote of confidence in its bill that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a Conservative has told the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP would immediately declare himself to his constituents.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the eventual establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion by Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on the subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, claims that this idea did not come from yesterday: Quebec had already consulted the New York Department of Investigation on this issue last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Still, Wednesday's announcement has surprised more than just one.
It must be said that this measure, at the meeting of the Permanent Committee of the Quebec Police Service on 29. October last year, despite Robert Dutil's presence, was not discussed in the least.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "rabbit conjured up out of hat" as well as "solution rightly crafted at a table end."
Minister Dutil, for his part, had in turn reached out to those who fear that political power would have too much influence on the future unity in question.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he contented to reaffirm.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of the CSQ, nothing can replace conducting a public poll.
"The more M. Charest insists on wanting to prevent the formation of this investigative committee, the more people like you and I will think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means of being able to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (state). University to train senior administrative officers).
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes that Quebec grant a special mandate to financial audit control so that it can conduct appropriate research on corruption and collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of exam control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the same power to audit control as commissioners, which would also allow it to oblige people to testify.
The formation of a standing unit is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
The Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law to better be prepared for this kind of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear-cut.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps in 2001, which involved the groups of motorcycle police, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers remain under heavy guard due to the high rainfall that has poured in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
A landslide occurred in Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were preemptively evacuated.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the administrative region of Lanaudiere.
A road has collapsed into itself.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall have poured into several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec security service issued warnings about the flood alarm regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière become the object of flood monitoring here and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, the heavy rainfall has resulted in the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evasive bridge was torn away due to heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on high alert and closely monitors the situation, according to security councillor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Flood Centre, for its part, issued warnings on Wednesday of the sharp rise of several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly rebuked
The Quebec broadcaster Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial statements about social welfare and Haitians, as well as because of his lapsed speech via radio.
The CCNR is the opinion that M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team have the right to express their opinion, but certain statements have contained "inaccurate information about social care and unjustified negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such an unsophisticated way of speaking that is not appropriate to the broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide, which involves the dissemination of the names of two people who committed suicide, violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the broadcasts broadcast in the period of 2008 and 2010.
The first injunction was filed as a result of a complaint by the "Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec."
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
Rather, moderators should provide sound information as misleading.
With regard to the subject of suicide, presenter Stéphane Dupont had argued that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had drawn the conclusion that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the "Dupont le midi" programme have raised a sensitive issue in a family-friendly and suitable manner."
Therefore, he was not slapped with any rebuke to his person.
The last point of contention was the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute in this regard, which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI presenter had stated that he had not donated in favor of Haiti aid, as one would not know for sure whether the needy would actually receive the monetary donations.
The Supervisory Board believes that these comments were not of an abusive character, but that their cumulative effect presented an unjustified negative representation of the Haitians.
“I have already served my three-day suspension penalty in this matter.”
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the moderator explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unsolid way of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM broadcaster had acted "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the broadcaster, which was to communicate, among other things, its decisions once during the prime time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montreal of Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact kung-fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, is now rising in the search for new challenges on the Tatami and into the boxing rings of the world.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the struggle of everywhere, since for those who do not like the ground combat, as presented by the mixed martial arts, competitions in North America are rare.
Recently, the his sign working as a security officer and employed by the company UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he at the between the 23rd and 30. October in Edinburgh, Scotland, won two gold medals from the World Karate and the Kickboxing Association (WKA).
"I won the win in the categories of full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
“Currently I am preparing for the World Cup at the San Shou in China.”
“It had been invited those fighters from each category who had placed in the top four at the last World Cup.”
“I won bronze in Toronto in 2009.”
“I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005.”
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in China in fifth place while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
“It’s worth noting that I’ve made progress in every competition.”
“With this rhythm, I’m going to be first this time or next year!”
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines from China, where punches and foot kicks as well as ground throws are permissible.
The duels usually play out on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter who emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal retain only one event in his career, he would almost certainly call his presence here at the super tournament "King of Sanda," the Super Bowl of Kung-Fu.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most respected in China," the likeable pound guy explained.
“It’s a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee Stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand).”
“That was a super experience.”
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he analysed.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
“The winners of the semi-finals will each face each other in the final of their category.”
“Then the victors of each category offer themselves to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu.”
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has mutually agreed to grant project planning firms $450 million in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts is a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, at a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a side effect of Hydro-Québec's decision to the private sector its responsibility to hand over this important, hydroelectric project amounting to a total of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" won the lucrative treaty without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that raises the risk of competitive displacement and price increase.
“This is a new way of playing a carded game and invalidating the competition.”
"This means that instead of playing cards instead of secretly in an open form," Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, said at the press conference yesterday.
In the early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult to understand how the interest of the public can be served in this way.
Resources Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded in the afternoon by vehemently denying that this contract was a mapped-out game.
"I remain true to my line," she said, enhanced that the PQ had proceeded "dishonestly" and it "lacks hardship."
She said it was "the least" the PQ apologized.
The consortium's model is common practice worldwide.
It is usually a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity in terms of its work.
The construction process is underway and is expected to be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without a competition having been able to take place; there had already been negotiations.
In addition, the model of the consortium in Quebec is by no means an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the model of the consortium applied in the field of civil engineering and consulting is the subject of government investigations.
A brief flyover of the Quebec business register allows to name more than 200 consortia, some of which appear to be of consistent duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau cooperates in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any linkage, and there are several dozen of them, attributes to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the "Énergie gérance" consortium, Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has paid special attention to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the large employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has made a statement that has made the nose about the fact that the contract for the project management was approved by agreement.
“If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prices will skyrocket.”
“So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell yourself: you will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price.”
"The thought, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the people," Laporte affirmed.
This contract, approved to the "Énergie gérance" consortium, is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received by the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved by either Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultant contracts, which companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, were approved between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All of these contracts have been negotiated.
They total $449 783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" for $295 $131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec are well known".
Minister Normandeau had suggested that the PQ was equally connected with the companies that "financed" it before it clarified that it was rather their executives.
Barometer responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trust-inspiring
Greener, but unabashedly skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the main players in sustainable growth, but neither does the branded brands or the eco-labels that are supposed to control his choice.
Too bad, although it bathes in a media-effective universe, where it is teeming with information in favor of a more responsible consumption: the barometer of responsible consumption has to complain about a lack of credible information, an inadequacy that identifies itself as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading that was held yesterday showed.
Although they drove the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who are trying to sell it.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admits, in fact, to believe the environmental commitment of the companies as little as the green corporate advertising, so reveals the measuring instrument, which is sophisticated by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
Following the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important for stimulating this segment of consumption, which is currently animated by nearly only one-third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and dubious nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services they are trying to put in place.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and mainly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the Barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - the Homo consumus of Quebec loves to present itself as the king of recycling, who tries to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness nevertheless seems to stop in front of his car, according to the barometer: only 28% of Quebecers have stated that they have used public transport in 2010 or preferred the ride-sharing center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The walking and cycling were also endorsed by 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioral survey, which feeds the clichéd ideas.
Government bond for the acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by the Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the takeover of the cinema complex eXcentris, agrees to a cooperation, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, which had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois-owned cinema complex eXcentris on Boulevard Saint-Laurent in order to hand it over to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they have asked.
The government has accepted to be involved in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government offers a bond at a lower than the initially hoped-for amount, which could create a viable solution on favorable terms, at least in the opinion of the sources removed from the state rumor mill.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by the Quebec last spring, the request has been revised down again since the sum-down.
A proposal together with an action plan has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is directing the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he had sent her a final factual report.
However, the cabinet's counter-proposal was sent to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31. December time to respond to these.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed aside.
Let us recall that the Quebec community of cinemas and cinema complexes had rebelled against a direct state investment in support of the takeover of eXcentris by making the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance for real estate projects there that he did not also send to other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants in the segment, in contrast, sued substantial, economic assistance.
After the self-financed construction of the cinema, cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for more than ten years under great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele by the pole.
The Société Angus and the Parallèle company with Christian Yaccarini at the helm, in turn, are heading for a privately financed campaign, from which they hope to raise a total of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on February 27 next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvois "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, has not dismissed the newspaper "Le Devoir" and was ignored what he and his group think of the downward-corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Mystery of complex-shaken Canada revealed
The new, American diplomats, circulated by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations is considering under the inferiority complex of Canadians towards the Americans; but they expose with the same blow the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind on the ballot, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly disseminated yesterday, offer even more piquant details than the mere substantial content to nibble on.
One of the 22. September 2008 dating connection, i.e. in the period in which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point at which point the United Nations no longer participates in the operations discussed by its political chiefs.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador deployed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
“An inferiority complex that is almost inherent to Canadians may cause Canadian, political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life rather than to blame the United States in this election (as in 1988 in the campaign on free trade),” he describes.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him."
The ambassador understands this "deafending silence" all the less so as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party, and much more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship, which the voter has in mind when voting in the ballot."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the on the 22nd January 2009 by Terry Breese, a business director in Ottawa, sent to President Barack Obama prepare for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their journey will help ensure the government's continued existence in the vote of confidence over the federal budget in early February, where Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade that has emerged due to a $30 to $40 billion revitalization program," Breese describes.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to postpone the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the so conditional continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revitalization program.
Another announcement, dated from January 2008 and written by Ambassador Wilkins, informs Washington of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC spread from the United States.
The ambassador is alarmed by broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe little subtle allusions to Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or even drafts for the purpose of interrogations carried out by muscle of the CIA.
Another communication reports in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to take in certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered the question with yes, but on the basis of an individual "case-by-case" decision.
À at the end of the meeting, as described, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper on Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
“The Secretary of State has pledged to look through the file again.”
Finally, let’s note that the minds are heating up with regard to the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper's very close adviser, had stated on CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He had been speaking here on Mike Huckabee from the United States.
Worldwide plan for the renewal of lighting
The UN yesterday proposed in Cancun a plan to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in the greenhouse gas (CFC) reduction, which corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be realized to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of the industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFC released to the earth due to the lighting if the white-hot bulbs, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, were replaced by fluorescent or better yet, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major exhaust emitters such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans that were supposed to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, one would still have to deduct 5 Gt from this balance sheet in order to stabilize the climate increase by 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white glowing bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact fluorescent bulbs, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs, this energy requirement is reduced again by two times.
The compact fluorescent bulbs last between 6000 and 10,000 hours on average.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company, incidentally, took part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, which conveys a hint of the savings opportunities of the exchange plan to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs give off very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact fluorescent pears have reserves because they contain mercury and that they therefore have to be disposed of as special waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the producers provide a receiving point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact fluorescent bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit substantially more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-hot bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury annually.
The report lays out in detail the profits that any country would generate thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars a year on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election right after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent electoral commission to preserve its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," a spokesperson for the UN chief stressed.
“He asks all parties and institutions of the Ivory Coast to demonstrate their responsibility and to abstain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had let the deadline, which was set for Wednesday at midnight, three days after Sunday's election, without publicizing the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the president of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many appeals from all over the world have become loud that the CEI should finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of voting under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp expects the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which were achieved by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup that failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's practiced maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the president from going to the election.
The entire election could be annulled if the complaints filed by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo opponents now hold more of the view that the country's highest court is not neutral, since it is led by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely linked to Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North, who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in proclaiming the election results as "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies affirmed that Gbagbo was blocking the publication of the results, knowing that he had lost; and that he had filed a complaint before the Constitutional Court, after the Electoral Commission was prevented from publishing the results, was illegal.
The second round of Sunday's presidential election was held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two parts over years.
The United Nations had warned on Wednesday the politicians of the Ivory Coast that it could be held responsible for them in the event of possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of voting on 31. October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), behind him as a top candidate.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is in the sense of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis at a stable 9.3% (including the overseas departments to 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office Insee.
The unemployment figure in the metropolis is establishing itself at 2.631 million.
The second quarter figures amounted to 9.3% of the working-age population in the metropolis and 9.7% involving the departments overseas.
Over the year, the unemployment rate saw a 0.1 percentage point rise.
In more detail, 3.4 million employees of the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wanted to find a job; included whether they were operational every two weeks or not or whether they were job-seeking or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25%, involving the overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people aged between 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Seniors, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of those over the age of 50, 6.6% involving the overseas departments.
Only the 25-49-year-olds had been able to benefit from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a dispute over its calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office Insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues to continue in this method and announced on Tuesday a quota of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
An investigation was launched against Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône (PS) region, and he was sent to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected of fraud markets.
Alexandre Guérini has been charged with embezzling company assets, embezzling common goods, concealing, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and gun ownership, according to his lawyer.
“Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him, rather than spread fantasy.”
"It is easy to insinuate a number of criminal charges, another matter is to prove it," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Presse) before his client's hearing.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had attached great importance to the judge before his hearing by means of his lawyers a memoradum for his justification.
A relative of Guérini, Philippe Rapezzi, was also charged and detained on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill running, which he had to run.
He would never have had any knowledge of the business competence area or the destination of the related funds, according to Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former Director General of the Aubagne Conurtal Area, was also charged with embezzlement and complicity on Wednesday, but was then released under the condition of staying away from the protagonists of these acts under judicial supervision.
“My client was able to provide explanations of the facts that were accused of him.”
"The lead prosecutor has taken into account not to rob him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been placed under indictment and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to deputy chief prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Deputy Managing Director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) waste disposal company, is prosecuted for "unauthorised influence and passive bribery".
Two state officials of the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "evasion and misappropriation of common property by a public service commissioner," the other for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds."
Alexandre Guérini's partner, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "conceiving and embezzling society assets."
Among the people confronted with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently imprisoned for a similar affair of fraudulent public-sector activities that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his society of having helped to launder money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal branch, will be conducted in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters in the files of several open investigations.
Close sources of investigation show that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the contract and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also covers waste from the Aubagne area and from certain cities of the Marseille Urban Cable Islands (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée Palace exaggerates its intermediary function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher held in Iran for "espionage," held the French public to breath, put diplomacy on high alert and accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
This all under the attentive gaze of the United States diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some background of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained its strategy to the Americans, who went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French officials have tried to convince Washington that the liberation of the young Frenchwoman did not have the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held captive in France and wanted by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material in favor of Iran's nuclear program.
Finally, they put in a bright light the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in that regard.
One on the 12. August 2009 in Paris-redicated diplomatic telegram is titled "Iran: French comments on the way of dealing with hostage-takings."
François Richier, Elysée adviser on strategy issues, chatted with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone in the company of Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained to her the French method.
They advised the Americans to do everything they can to repatriate their own nationals who would be forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which pays very sensitive attention to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do that.”
Because "silence does not solve anything", pass the discussion attempts over in an unremarkable way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive manoeuvres".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (the one on the 16th August should come about, on the day she takes refuge in the French embassy) "demand the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he says the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said.
28. August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but is still being held in Iran.
One piece of information has been circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding due to illegal trade in sensitive electronics to Iran, has been released from custody following a judge's decision in Paris.
The American Embassy, like numerous other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which tracks the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material intended for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand represents bad news.
Has France accepted a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the French woman?
On the occasion of a renewed discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on the 4th September assures François Richier that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's decision," but also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand remains under "strict" oversight of French intelligence.
The Elysée adviser dials a phone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently in the buildings in Paris led by the Iranian Embassy."
During the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make it believe by means of pronouncements and "escape attempts" organized by the media, that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad is playing an "important" and "influential media outlet."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of the 25. August 2009 dating telegram conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities."
What is so much "testimony" to Mr. Assad is based on, the Paris Embassy wonders.
“Despite their statements full of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did.”
The document then looks at the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzes.
A policy launched in 2008, which at the time was "present and undeserved by numerous critics in France and abroad."
"Inspiring the Syrian role," Paris is trying to show Syria what commendation can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region.
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On the 11. François Richier had entrusted her to August: "Of course, we do not know whether the Syrians have done whatever."
“But we thanked them despite everything.”
“This should at least create confusion among the Iranians.”
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16. back to France in 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favour of the release of our countryman."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law, called "the Cinderella", which will prohibit the young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials indicated.
A bill to urge online game operators to deny young people under the age of 16 after midnight access to these games will be submitted to parliament in December, representatives of culture and family ministries described.
“A lot of kids play these games all night long and then have trouble learning at school and also living a normal life during the day.”
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said Jo Rin, ministerial representative of the French press agency Agence France Presse, who is tasked with this bill.
The online games will be accessible again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturing companies would have a year to prepare for the application of the law, he clarified.
The government is also considering asking manufacturers to reduce the time limit granted daily to access these games to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the person in charge added.
He will also provide free programs to those people who wish to, that make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, compared to 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
In bright excitement due to suspicion of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political election in which the struggle for influence and lobbying threaten to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, though: the 2018 edition of FIFA's supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Federation hopes to win new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to pursue its branch in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
So the machinations behind the scenes threaten to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so weighty for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the result of the suspension of two members of the executive office (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely in 1966.
The BBC had given the breeding ground again on Monday by broadcasting a documentary report that takes three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou, under fire.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had engaged in intense lobbying with David Cameron in these past few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the move succeeded by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organization of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort be enough to revalue England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal do not lack trumps with their already finished stadiums, his expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
Yet the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, are raising Russia's chances, which has become the weighty outsider despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unequivocal insinuation of the English press's accusations of "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
"You throw dirt on them, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the 1994 experience, seems to be the logical favorites.
First world economic power, seat of FIFA's main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have set up a very nice project separately.
But these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: the FIFA-awaited approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which makes the Asian chances of 2022 lapse.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled all the stops with the uptime of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries pose a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time difference) acquited by European countries, FIFA's sensitive nerve.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really cut.
Mitterand had made him feel snubbed.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this one.
One mandate at the Elysée summons the next.
The current head of state will be an ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not stand up well to the side of the mystery that attaches to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
In one sense, as well as in the other.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac’s supporters pretended that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On the 15th November assured Nicolas Sarkozy in a serious tone that he would make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011."
That he would sound the perspective of "two mandates" on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians, had therefore spread a little feverishness.
Was this the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president merely pointed out that the constitutional amendment of 2008 limited the number of five-year terms to only two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You still have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
To a new one in May 2010: "Don't think I'm not thinking about the phase after that."
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more of a candidate than the day before; but also no less.
If they cause comments, it is for a two reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the horsepower on one side.
It is not, however, the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal that is driving Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal himself.
On the contrary, it is his apparent candidacy in 2012 that admonish many members of the PS earlier than assumed to be combative.
The poor polls on the other side.
For the first time, voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express) poll.
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion whatsoever about it with the UMP," the prime minister's environment responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to find a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin said.
"He will always believe in being able to win," corrects Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with the obviousness.
Euro: ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the ECB’s Central Bank Council last year should provide an opportunity to show opportunities to get out of the crisis, or at least announce the arrangement of a large number of unconventional measures of monetary policy, which are due to conclude at the end of the year.
The crisis of European government debt, the central bank in Frankfurt can undoubtedly not afford to forfeit today’s, more than tense situation in the European bond markets, in order not to cause its worsening.
The political costs would be far too high.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB at a press conference in favour of the resolution of Europe's national budget debt.
She did not dare to say whether she thought the central bank could do even more, for example by boosting its program of buying government bonds.
“I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not shown himself very eloquent about his plans the day before in Brussels at his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Committee of the European Parliament, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would be "continued" and that we will "see how the decisions will be made" at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the bond purchases of the Treasury were doubled by the ECB last week to about €1.35 billion.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, it is said to have made new purchases on Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, the Eurosystem's central banks have made €67 billion in purchases since May 2010.
Among the merchants, the anticipation of a continuation of the purchase price is in no way doubted (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect a remarkable change in the course.
If the bond transactions of more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the latter will still be able to cope with the unrestricted reserves of funds in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
Economists are already thinking that this measure will be expanding by a few months.
“I cannot imagine that the ECB will substantially amend its programme.”
"Otherwise, it would take the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," suspects Michael Schubert, economist at Commerzbank.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," says Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the market of public debt, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of bonds that enliven the sluggish market," Norbert Bräms adds.
Given the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of sovereign debt in the eurozone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must replace the lack of investors in the market at any price and act in such a way as to prevent the hasty enthusiasm about the yields paid to the weakest states," a key bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to fly in height, states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price for protecting the euro.
The Berlusconi government takes cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the fall in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
By the end of the meeting with the economy minister, the region's chairwoman Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned, however, immediately denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the bankruptcy risk had risen to 263 points, which had caused a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy at German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as "seriously concerned" by the "market turmoil" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the third eurozone economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain English, this means that its problem is the absence of economic growth and the accompanying, dwindling tax inputs, which put the state in danger of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The last Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth of 1.1% is expected in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012... although the budget for consideration by the Senate expects 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (contrary to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil surrounding a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are in order and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating this for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, who is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
“At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short-term nor in the long term, since Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A. d. R.) Lower stabilization progress is required than by other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD Chief Economist.
The question remains of political inconsistency.
On the 14. In December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence from the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organised as early as the end of March.
A less favourable period is therefore imminent for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans think about expanding anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had emphasized it yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "I believe it was still proven on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: The Europeans clearly stick together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although completely relative - the deduction recorded yesterday on the interest rate feet of European government bonds was water on the mills of governments as well as the ECB.
However, there can be no mention of a start of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt notice of Portugal, probably the most effective target of speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility, which weighs particularly heavily on the banking systems," according to the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time passes much more slowly than that of markets."
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that lies in it, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the anti-crisis measures that already exist.
The informal consultations between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in a broader sense, with their counterparts to the G20 are progressing well.
And this also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
On the plan is the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of the eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As for the EU Stability Fund, its Executive Director Klaus Regling has already started his Asia tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first securities expenditure by the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative had confided to Reuters that the United States supported a possible increase in the fund mobilized by the IMF's additional, direct commitment.
Portugal and Spain, the first-round countries, are in turn preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures, but should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both one and the other are to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have drawn up their own budget correctives and decided on unavoidable structural reforms that will restore their trust in the long term.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalization process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who joined on 24. Found November in Paris, the first to produce the idea that if the €750 mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to reach into its own pocket again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, with regard to the market of European public debt, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
This remedy exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which is currently 60 billion euros.
An advisory board that has all the chances of being studied attentively in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are worsening.
Snow and freezing ice: 24 departments in alarm level orange
The snow episodes are still experiencing traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to impair various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in alarm stage orange due to the threat of snow and freezing ice risk.
The regions of Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already in alarm orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later at night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows slightly on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, as well as 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm are expected in the Paris region.
The regions affected are the regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic obstructions and affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac transport axes.
The traffic situation of the secondary traffic networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In Picardy, school traffic was lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "urges motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads as well as to adapt their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris' Roissy airport on Thursday and 10% of flights departing from Orly due to the expected, heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends that air passengers contact their airline.
Gatwick Airports in south London, as well as the airport in Edinburgh, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate about the modernization of the transport industry on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has rained billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, we remember the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital endowment of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow to lend a portion of the financial sum at its twofold in the markets.
Today, it has finally come to first projections.
The supplementary budget of 2010, seen this morning by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures provided for in order to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax on development and a higher taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favour of the public service institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "in order to modernize it, in order to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase in the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
A mystery.
This amount is not quantified in the text.
Of the 4 billion, one is far away.
"It is stated that the tax resources are added to the €4 billion of the capital endowment raised by the state and gradually provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the statement said.
With the SGP, you do not find this system offensive at all.
“Since the moment you record revenues (the two taxes, d. R.), you can cover the project planning for over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
“This is being recorded in the budget and gradually withdrawn.”
The SGP estimates that 2013 will begin to list the $4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, whose 4 promised billions will be able to be searched for a long time, runs the risk of creating a fairly moving, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7. December instead.
Vengeful hackers and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a twofold meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy that governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, giving a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's go ahead in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is confirmation of the fact that each file (of an x-nation) created by an intelligence agency is composed exclusively of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits throw nothing further than what you got to read for months anyway in any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the terrifyingly caricatured profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists fabric for their skits for a long time.
The rule, according to which the secret dossiers are allowed to consist only of already known news, is essential to the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will realize that each work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrus) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author does not want to publish any research on occult texts (nor because he would not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirms what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the secret service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération) who only considers true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, was the same as those that Newsweek had already published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made about the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, these state what every educated person already knows, namely that the messages - at least since the end of the Second World War and since then also the heads of government can call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some small representational tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it is not out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore it.
Still, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
In second place: The idea that an arbitrary hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country carries the considerable blow to the prestige of the state department.
In addition, the scandal brings less the victims, but rather the "executioners" in distress.
But let's devote ourselves to the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother, controlling every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have since turned out to be perfectly correct, where you can control any movement thanks to the phone, any transaction made, the hotel visited, the highway chosen and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one considers what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control process ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the avenger of the citizen - can learn the secrets of power.
But how can a power hold that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
True, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret free of secrets, since it exposes the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to rob them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not wronged Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama have done wrong.
What will be the consequences of this insult, which has been inflicted on such a vast power?
It is obvious that in the future the states will no longer provide any reserved information online - this would be equivalent to a notice glued to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies, it is in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports over the phone secret.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships be maintained in the future and only for certain ears?
I know very well that my prediction at the moment sounds like science fiction and romantic, but I find myself compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in secret on uncontrollable marching routes, carrying their messages nowhere else in the mere memory, and, moreover, hiding the little written information they have received in shoe sales.
The information would be stored in locked drawers in only copies: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to explore a film volume by band by winding from back to front and unraveling all the secrets of assembly, while the (numeric) CDs nowadays allow nothing but to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macro portions.
The high-speed trains take you from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this takes three and a half hours by plane including the changeover.
It is therefore not unusual for politics and communication technology to come back to the car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were being forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is talking its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to examine compliance with the quickly resolved funding promises (also called "Fast Start" or premature financing) that have been realized by developing countries.
And already the rough French fine speeches are uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised €7.2 billion over three years, France €1.26 billion (i.e. 420 million a year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has drawn up all the registers to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report from its Member States, press conference, major side events, brochure distribution.
Operation Transparency is remarkable and valued for its actual value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announced that it would release €2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on the right path to paying respect for its commitment of €7.2 billion in 2012.
But if you look into the detail, things are a little more complicated.
This money, according to the Copenhagen Treaty, should be "new and additional" to ensure that an additional deployment has been brought in without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what "new and additional" means.
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the benchmark that they consider to be best.
The EU Commission, for example, has chosen itself as a benchmark for that of 2009: international financing will be maintained and will add 150 million over three years as part of the "fast-start" financing.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or in terms of conditions at official development assistance level.
In return, France felt the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 was "new and additional."
In other words, there are no benchmarks for the previous year's expenditure or at the global level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total amount of French support for developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) - France pretends to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" financing.
Another crucial element is the breakdown into donations and loans.
There is no rule about that yet, and everyone chooses their computing mode.
Some, such as France, find €1 borrowed as equivalent to €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects tied to emissions containment) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro, which is co-opted as the equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be credited as an exposure (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing else in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of €420 million by taking out 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of this.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among others) are 100% in their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 to fulfil its obligations, France gives just 10 cents and means a comparable stake.
Nice hocus-pocus!
All in all, France operates in its fast-start financing with a double hoax: in part with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros in the process.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once internally (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries do not allow to be completely deceived...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question in a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the UNFCCC's immense machinery.
Let's hope this is not going to be the case.
However, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature financing.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and balancing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of the long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of "calculability" or the type of booking of its loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive about the issues of dispute as it is with other things.
So the hope rests on the new environment minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about the fast-launch of France and its vision of "predictability" as well as the use of loans would naturally raise the international basis of trust necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years old takes 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Association of Générations Futures (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "do not reflect statistically significant value in view of the small number of samples analyzed, but represent illustration character of the treated problem," had bought between July and September the foods usually consumed by a roughly ten-year-old child at meals, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris, between July and September.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - have been studied, as have been checks from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safely carcienogenic, as well as 37 substances with an endocrinin disorder factor, according to studies of several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if, in the approximate totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, it is nevertheless very well evident from this survey that the reality in which the consumer may be exposed to carcinogenic substances or substances with an endocrinin disturbing factor is worrying," the association observes.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone contain more than ten of the possibly cancer-causing residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, shows traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in lunch, where the study has found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the hoe steak, the tuna from the rifle, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were peppered.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak was the most "rich" with 34 determined chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unencumbered.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" to the consumer "is likely to be undervalued," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV) has proposed, for its part, "in the face of the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilisation diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified reference to the presence of residues of 365 of various pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in grains.
