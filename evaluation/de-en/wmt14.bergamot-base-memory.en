Schools are encouraged to gain a greater focus on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will in future have to perform at least one play by Shakespeare, a novel of 19. Century, romantic lyricism and contemporary British novels from 1914 on.
In the exam, "unseen texts" also find their way in to encourage broader reading.
The combined course from English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, pupils will have to take a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curriculums for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the regulator for audits, will announce a reorganization of GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is a "wide consensus that we need to reform our exam system to restore public trust," stressing that the GCSEs would become "more challenging, ambitious and strict."
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a stronger weighting of the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum focuses on “problems from real life”, including financial mathematics.
Rapist in South Africa: two life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice for life on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim later died from the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty earlier in the week of the crime.
The act had sparked horror nationwide.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, doctors fought for the survival of the victim, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses and sisters needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial to having been in a bar with booysen on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to having beaten and raped her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
Police had initially run out of several offenders but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost part of everyday life in South Africa: there are about 64 000 sexual violence complaints every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of sexual violence to be 10 to 25 times.
In a small town in New Zealand, Burt Muro is considered a lovable owl because he has set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt, despite a heart defect, is not dissuaded by his dream.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the movie, there's coffee, tea and cake.
Stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX continues to hold its customers in its breath.
Trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a statement, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of smaller and bigger breakdowns at the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indices of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent massively faulty purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators took almost a whole day to look through and cancel the orders.
Two days later, half of the total U.S. stock trading came to a halt for several hours because of a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq exchange.
In addition, the IPO of Facebook caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been up to the tide of buying and selling orders, the Securities and Exchange Commission later noted and thundered the company to a record fine of 10 million dollars.
Intelligence revealer Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation.
The US-sought former NSA employee made this clear in an unaddressed letter, which the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
The letter, after a translation distributed by Ströbele, has the following wording:
To the responsible
I was asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be contractual. on a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government, which caused me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced a serious and persistent incitement that forced me to leave my family and home.
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations on a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These espionage revelations drew many suggestions on new laws and guidelines aimed at the formerly covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of allegiance and seeks to criminalize and indict political expression.
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States government, with the support of the international community, will abandon this detrimental attitude.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and in accordance with the law in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country once the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden testifies by Hans-Christian Ströbele
Driver who had raced between his legs at 210 km/h and hot drink will receive £1,000 penalty
A £1,000 penalty was imposed on a motorist for driving between his legs at up to 210 km/h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was born on 27. May stopped with his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree.
After police stopped him, they spotted the drink cup between his legs.
Before the District Court of Colchester, Howie pleaded guilty without taking the necessary care and attention.
He received seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also convicted of paying £90 and a £100 victim surcharge.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill toy squads with machete
Two children have admitted to the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Afterwards, they would have played football in front of their apartments in a working-class district.
The next night, the body was found in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, who had taken her with her, was to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl described the crime to the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the premeditated killing of the 11-year-old.
Among other things, the elder cited a rivalry in the football game as a reason.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth institution.
Jerusalem government fails to confirm attack on Syrian airbase
An American government official, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed on Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airbase in Syria's Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and associated equipment," which the Israeli government feared was intended for Lebanon's Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had earlier reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled during the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, where Russian S-125 Newa-type missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen, according to Channel 2, have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official as saying that he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not sure.
An Israeli Defense Ministry said, “We are not commenting on these reports.”
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successfully, to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" that a military response would follow.
On the way through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, only one for 5,000 people
Vote here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is among the top 10 in CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for the CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive 250,000 dollars to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched as his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car crash near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only a broken arm, but then an inflammation formed, which spread to his brain and caused a hematoma there, which was to affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," according to Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," Bwelle comments.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet you're not first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of the country's health spending is private.
"The only problem they have is poverty," says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered to see the decision to do something about it in Bwelle.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped just under 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and drive with the laced medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything doesn't always go smoothly.
Already more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, song and dance, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and a wave – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is happy to be part of the cheerful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – a document required for school but simply cannot afford many poor families.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go into the recreation area to make room for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's an exhausting workload, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team then drives back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries last year and knows that with their work, it makes a huge difference to the people it helps.
One man explained that the free operation of a hernia, which he had received, now allows him to return to work.
"It's changing my family's future," said the man.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable activity, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine for the second year at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteers in Bwelle's group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain practical experience they would never get at home.
“We can be part of operations where we help to swab blood or the instruments for Dr. Keeping a wave," explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and frequently bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and instructions.
"He's undoubtedly a hero," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live a happier life and thus fulfilling a promise he has given his father gives him great pleasure.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," says Bwelle.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be on 22. February first called new cardinals of the Catholic Church, the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this is the case for a group of 120 “cardinals entitled to vote”.
In a statement in which the news was announced, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said that a meeting of all cardinals would take place before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as a consistory, would be held.
"Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of eligible cardinals is likely to have dropped by February.
He explained that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary for the number of eligible cardinals to be 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
Next year’s consistory is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and in particular Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Council of Cardinals established by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who are tasked with finding opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He declared that it was "good that Francis was asking the cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops would be called to cardinals from large places, but Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he’s appointing.”
Worker crashed from ladder: seriously injured
When replacing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder on Thursday and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outer facade of an inn.
As he climbed onto the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slid away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital by rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6."
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with the UK?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change our relations with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, roughly mapping UK corporate sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing while states in the EU are stagnant.
They wish that new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil would be favoured by the government side, rather than dwelling on the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
Asked for their view on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general discontent over the internal market, as the companies say that the costs of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed to this, which is traditionally the most Europe-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most, our survey of business leaders found that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This realization, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the booklet of action back to the UK.
It's about a lot -- a change in the deal and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 per cent.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the UK economy is behind its plan for the renegotiation of the UK's terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in the balance of power back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as evidenced by the result of our survey, which means increased attention for companies to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.

Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today on the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled people in the industry are to be qualified to become professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"What's new is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the employment agency Neubrandenburg.
The benefits are diverse: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained specialists, who were increasingly missing in hotels and restaurants, and the agency did not have to finance unemployment.
The project is also involved in the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

GM recalls new pickup trucks in US to repair seat back
General Motors is recalling just under 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a notice from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulator on Friday.
In some of the cars, there may be a defect in the mechanism for restoring the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not comply with the federal guidelines for vehicle safety at headrests.
"When the vehicle is hit by the vehicle from behind, it is possible that the headrest will not properly protect the occupants, so there is an increased risk of injury," the message read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were between the 1. August and 10. September made.
Delivery of the GM trucks began in June, representing the leading model launch of the leading U.S. automaker since the 2009 insolvency-related restructuring.
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA failed to review the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which negatively impacted October car sales.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were newly developed for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to US$37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Mother buried in forest and pensions conceded
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect her pension and care allowance.
In order to continue to collect pensions and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburg man buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations.
First he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he had slashed the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May: At that time, it was noticed that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told investigators his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officials, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime, according to police.

Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car pull with tractors, there is the agricultural autumn festival on the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8. September another competition.
Saturday, 7. September, start the Highlander Games at 13.30.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and lone fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't depend on the vastness," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown off vertically, should roll over once and then come straight to rest.
This is rated with the most points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the accuracy of the target.
From eight metres away, a stake is thrown.
The participants must demonstrate skill and strength during water bucket carrying over 50 meters.
The time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
You can train from 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the tartan skirt.
But Swabian costume is also allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury awards a few more bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander Games and the tractor-pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, there is already a lot of action on the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass bands get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the birabooic brass music from Schömberg will be designing the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays brisk polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
The Heinz Koch from Weilen, known as a singing host and black sausage baron, will be present among the gutters.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the guild of fools.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for breakfast, from 14 o'clock the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the festival.
The stopper party with DJ Ralf will start on Friday.
Other program items on Saturday and Sunday include the Oldtimer- und Schleppertreffen, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the maize maze, the crafts market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under instruction) and tractor surfing.
Organizers are the Förderverein Multizweckhalle, the Skiclub and the Traktorfreunde "Zündkäpsele".
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
"We are in a frightening situation and one may ask ourselves: What keeps Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?" was to be read in the newspaper, which does not consider the draft law constitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punishing and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it is an extended arm of government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we will appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the government is effectively strangling the media through the new law. On the other hand, The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a serious blow" and described the draft as "draconian".
The adoption of the law is among a series of measures to strengthen national security in the wake of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping center in September.
Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities because they released footage from security cameras showing the units deployed to the crime scene allegedly robbing the luxurious shopping centre.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn after an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media outlets can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the possession of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, "even a single penalty can put most radio stations in bankruptcy."
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "liveable blogosphere" description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever know," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"If you leave politicians to yourself, they lead the country into bankruptcy and back to the time of the hunter-gatherers," he said.
Kenyan lawmakers have been attracting public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the national remuneration commission and re-enacted their hefty salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month – they are among the highest in the world.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Return of the first documentary mention is getting closer.
If the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming up.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in a document in 794.
In churches, a certificate was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On the 15. March there is to be an official start to the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event takes place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20. July the 1250.
Celebrate return.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this festive weekend there is also the Church-Hausener Kirchenfest.
City music director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On 21. June together with the Sunday celebration of the Black Forest Association, on the 12th. July in the arena with fireworks and on the 13th. December as the first concert of the Stadtmusik in the new Festhalle.
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on the 27th and 28th. September.
On the occasion of the Geising city anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.
"However, it is intended to be a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the violin of today, which consists of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the Geisingen of today also celebrates its birthday in 2014, in 1974 the present-day region was carried out with the incorporations.
The new chronicle is then scheduled to take place on 21 or 22. November in the new festival hall in Geisingen will be presented.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The guild of fools Strohglonki begins on 8. February with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen turns 90 and has on 29. March the banquet and then celebrates from 1 to 4. May the District Music Festival.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on the 10th. May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the fountain festival from 4 to 7. July.
The city of Geisingen was awarded a gift certificate in the possession of the monastery of St. Gallen is first mentioned in a document in 764.
The certificate was made in churches (Hausen), which was then court place.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 accordingly, in addition, the municipal reform is also 40 years ago.
Also this year on the name day of Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstraße celebrates a Hubertus fair.
St. Hubertus was, according to legend, a rather reckless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn brass group of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood It) according to old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear riding clothes, because they mainly accompany riders, horses and dog crowds on tow hunts musically.
The festive Mass will take place on Sunday, 3. November, at 11.30pm.
Supreme Court confirms Obama's health care bill
It's a huge victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court ruled today that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By a vote of five to four, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state’s tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the requirement of the health law that states would either have to expand the entry requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state Medicaid funding is not unconstitutional.
The lawsuit against the law had been brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill had been firmly opposed by all of the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary campaign.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in achieving only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail about the work of the association.
He himself was in 2004 for the first time in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, another cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the missions on a large screen were shown, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get an idea of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border protection vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to work with the association in an advisory role.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry company from Baiersbronn created the infirmary in Socogim, a slum on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis - on a voluntary basis.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Especially interesting in times when the maternity hospital in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
According to Henne, a lot of learning in Africa as a medical doctor, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, one could not make as many trips as planned, but many doctors came to Germany to visit here in various areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, dressing material, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their trip to Mauritania.
As his personal motivations, he cited his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost on the way, he decided to help the Africans control a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel emphasized that global economy also demands global love of humanity.
It should not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some people think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, which is located before the renovation, is to be refocused on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall was installed during the first work of the renovation of the front schoolyard, for the stabilization and static relief of the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
According to Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure envisages including the state monument office in the planning and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which will then be put on the table for the decision and determination of the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school, which was built in 1912, it must be renovated from the ground up and placed on new substructure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure, the boundary wall in need of renovation.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to the Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow tendency to the front.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of pupils using schoolyard, which has been done through the current fortification work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was even planned in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenses brought a postponement.
An important word in the historical school wall renovation, which has even been used for film recordings, will be spoken by the State Monument Office.
Should guidelines come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the preservationists.
The pupils of the Bräunlinger Elementary School, who are now being taught again in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, can soon use the old schoolyard.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown man fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management announced via the short message service Twitter that the gunman was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media also reported several injured.
U.S. President Barack Obama is constantly being briefed on the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure halls, several media outlets reported.
One traveler told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and cried children.
Among those waiting, panic broke out, many had hidden behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA had suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like being in a movie."
After that, he himself was taken to a security area, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security check area.
Airport building evacuated
Television images showed numerous ambulances and police cars in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building to safety.
Users posted on Twitter photos of a special operations squad and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 a.m. (local time).
The access roads were closed, which, according to CNN, formed long backlogs.
Except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several fliers were also observed on CNN at the launch.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles LAX Airport is a largest airport in the United States.
Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall traffic light.
Two facilities so close together: intention or shield coup?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall traffic light was installed at that time because it secures the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant officially put into operation yesterday is important for the intersection area Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light had to be built for their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the district office of Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is simply going ahead here," according to Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows were carried out, a roundabout was also considered, but because of the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was tested beforehand when the traffic light poles were selected: "By means of a transporter loaded with particularly long logs with particularly long logs, we have tested whether these vehicles can extend from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without bending over the traffic light poles".
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15 000 euros, is the "most modern thing that is currently on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs, which shine so powerfully that the lights can be easily recognized by the motorists, for example, even in low sun.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new system: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, there is immediate greenery for the pedestrian, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"Should a group or people who are disabled go across the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will get safely over the roadway," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver must think about here as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: No sooner did the traffic light for pedestrians show green than an upper-class vehicle rushed through - with bright red.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the winning title at the clubs' tennis tournament.
In the end, the endurance from Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had received the tennis department of the Sportfreunde Rohrdorf for the tournament of the local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was in the foreground of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, she was supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favorites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were on par with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so that the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wanderpokal to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finishing straight.
The second place was taken by the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze podium was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team.
With late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful conclusion of the tournament took place.
Bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling rig again
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling rink, was released back into nature.
The water rall was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was cared for by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rall was probably a wintry migratory bird from northern Europe, which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling rig.
He added: "He could not fly any further, which is why we were contacted with the request for help."
When she was released, the water rall was fit and healthy again.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railway between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operations, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120-by-90-centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found.
The tunnel, which runs in a zigzag pattern over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, authorities said.
Eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were recovered during the discovery of the tunnel, according to the court's records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life in a guilty verdict.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which poses the challenge of how to quickly get their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-meter-long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to 'aptitude test'
The government is considering a "real test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion designed to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified workplaces or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the former Labor Party MP, Maxine McKew, condemned the government's comments on foreign workers for being conceived as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
“Loud explanations such as ‘foreigners should queue at the back’ and ‘hire Australians first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions called for a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region see an echo of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once envisioned by former Immigration Secretary Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "Criterion of Authibity" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be checked to see "if the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related to or personally associated with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting entity."
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders, after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker presumably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been being looked after by an adult cousin since his father's death on Wednesday, who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian place takes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their gloomy valley.
Due to the low sun incidence, the Rjukan valley in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" enthused Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on broadcaster TV2.
Some valley dwellers set themselves up to sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
Until now, sunseekers had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council had finally approved the 5 million crown (around 615 000 euros) expensive project.
A similar construction has been giving the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella wintry sunshine for several years.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of home affairs and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in Berlin in the morning.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, MP bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Group also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, it should be about the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the coercion for German-born immigrant children to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of traffic, which is not on the conference regulations this Friday, the SPD confirmed its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for the topic of traffic, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There were threats of avoidance traffic on country roads, which are already the focus of accidents.
The introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would also be only a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that at a later date the compensation for Germans will be cancelled," he said.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the heap.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to the coal import, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue dump and return chargers distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the handling devices, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve security and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
In the case of unfavorable wind, this can unfortunately be heard widely - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore made contact with those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now in the process of keeping the warning signals quieter with technical measures.
He will continue to focus on open dialogue with neighbours.
Because Matthias Schrell still has a lot going on at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal import for power plants and is one of the big players in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the sunbathing tub in front of the terminal, which is recessed to 18.5 metres, Capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here.
"This year, we want to break the 3 million tonne mark in the envelope," said Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants in the inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is connected to the grid, a good 5 million tons of coal import per year will be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge, as well as the second conveyor belt, could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's mayor, Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The local council agreed to the sale in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier insists.
100 000 euros were set in the budget.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the previous kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, how to heat, look for the garden and clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," Maier rejoices.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I'm more likely to become a Halloween muffle.
For the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and I will probably not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of US$6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing that I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion US dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, incendiary inanimate items are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft punk spacemen will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess it's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and were not alone in this to my astonishment.
In fact, Americans are spending 330 million dollars this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of "hot dogs."
As for sweets, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend 1.9 billion dollars on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candies and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who move through the neighborhoods with the saying "sweet or sour" according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not kid ourselves – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; yet 15 million kilograms of it will be sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock."
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate 500 million dollars in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos in which you just pee in your pants and then put the friends on Facebook, where you can’t get rid of them again, and then the guy you’re into leaves a comment like “nice facial expression.”
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Big Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from an early age.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about 106 million dollars on pumpkins, according to the US Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, is believed to be from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score correctly, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921-kilo pumpkin.
Pimp must go to jail
Due to exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily harm, the District Court of Konstanz has a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two missions in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial arrangement.
According to this, he has met women in five cases via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent after a few weeks against their will on the line.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the income of the women, who partly bought for him for years.
By confiscating mobile phones and SIM cards, he prevented women from contacting the outside world.
Along with a colleague who taught the women, he took them to various brothels in the Southwest.
There he had them monitored in part to control their revenues.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion alongside him.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus of a limited capacity for guilt, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the injured women.
As a crime scene official reported, after an initial display by telephone surveillance measures, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be determined.
The intercepted conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered bruises all over his body, has not made a statement to date.
It is "a completely broken personality" that regards violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He broke away from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after detention," he said.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Oeid
An investigation by the state corruption watchdog is launched against the former minister of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the regulations on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who owned covert holdings of three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday extended its investigation into whether Obeid influenced various Ministers of State to extend leases on Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now it is being investigated over allegations that Tripodi knew of Obeid's covert interest in the properties after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies on Circular Quay, which brought in the Obeids 2.5 million dollars annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally advocated for public tenders.
Yet he denied making the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reshaping of the government's lease settlements.
A telephone transcript submitted to the ICAC showed conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority.
"Was this issue discussed in these telephone conversations the drafting of the commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
NSA revelations step up company paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the US consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BAT), the German intra-inner secret service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to an exchange of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, American Director of National Intelligence, again insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage opportunities "to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of American companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit."
Yet since Edward Snowden, the one-time employee who has become a whistleblower, has begun publishing his cornucopia of U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate executives have no longer been sure whether they can take the director at his word.
Reports that the American National Security Agency is spying on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtaining data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have pushed the company paranoia to a new high because of government surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then corporate management is certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now poses almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consultant firm EY.
In the documents leaked by Snowden, however, there was so far no evidence that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacked certain IT and internet opportunities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again ...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Still, reach and technical sophistication from U.S. spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked firms that had previously seen the biggest spy risk in China.
In the case of cloud computing, a major change is taking place, because European company managers are now more aware that data stored in the USA is subject to the case law there and are therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution, after revelations about U.S. data mining activity with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, deputy chief executive of SAP, says: "We see a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago -- it's: Where is my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in that jurisdiction?"
Many German company leaders take the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew anyway, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they have to be guarded at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like this.
"It was an issue for many years and has not fundamentally changed due to the current discussion," says Kurt Bock, chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate management usually does not brag about the countermeasures you have taken, because this gives attackers advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been inferred that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or the unguarded lying down of a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at car manufacturer Audi, says that for years it has been a standard practice to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as eavesdropping devices.
The German BAT advises executives to use simple prepaid mobile phones when they go on foreign trips because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the world’s market leaders in the respective niche.
"Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access," the BAT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, France, Russia and Israel ranked second behind China of the countries that used to obtain economic data of hacking.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, then "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRL, was quoted this month in an interview as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
When the horse show experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to crown the horse of the year, they were aware that a tough competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, who isn’t even in kindergarten and just took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland pony toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and took the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents.
The inseparable couple, both of them equal in size, were praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition, hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
On his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put on his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which was well above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his demeanor and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and walked off the pitch with Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells said, “The whole audience was electrified and everyone cheered him on and clapped him.”
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “horse of the year” show – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The jurors assessed Fenton and Toffee afterwards how well they would have beaten themselves and presented themselves in the screening ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes have done their part, that really fit perfectly with the occasion.
Nursing day at the small Englishman hut
On the fifth day of care in the wake of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut free on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
According to Kaiser, many hikers described this area as the highlight of the canyon trail, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the nursing day was a suitable instrument to strengthen the connection between people and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, ecological considerations could also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Regional Council explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist goal of the foresight coincides with the aim of preserving the now strongly overgrown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the remaining pastures.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections to preserve species.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area at this point.
The current measure is not only seamless in this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous care days for the future.
After these different explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been cut down in advance, the forestry tractor was ready to call if necessary.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the care of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the clear view at the viewpoint.
Experienced an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietingen seniors for coffee, cake and then for a vesper.
In the past, the older citizens were entertained in the rest area.
Meanwhile, this afternoon takes place in the nursing home St. Joseph instead.
The care home residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
Königsfeld: Small team is beating itself well
The volunteer fire department mastered its main autumn rehearsal with flying colors despite a lack of staff.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the Feder estate in Burgberger Straße in his practice acceptance.
There, a short circuit is said to have occurred during sawing.
Due to the resulting fire and the smoke development, two people were injured, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
Two weir respirators, after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer, were ready to enter the building.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and escort him out into the open.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, as there was also a narrow staircase to overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw bales in it.
There were also electric machines for woodworking.
The first firefighting attack took place via the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was carried out via a flood hydrant at a distance of about 100 meters.
Now three firefighting attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also interested in showing what can be achieved with little available personnel.
In an emergency, support is provided by the daily task force Königsfeld.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Iran satisfied with process of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to address the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif wrote on his Facebook page.
Although there would still be a long way to go, the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions linked to the rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasmanian healthcare system to ensure that the state's government cannot waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island nation, a higher rate of chronic disease and system restrictions.
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that we believe is addressing the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said in a statement.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars in emergency aid for election benefits.
A further 2600 surgeries, including orthopedic procedures and treatments for gray cataracts, are intended to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better after-care after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for the electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the ideas that clinic staff affected told me were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system," Tanya Plibersek said.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up and seek to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the 325 million dollars would be of little use if “they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course.”
Notwithstanding this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a big contribution to removing the state's public health system from the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the state's government, these electoral achievements will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the health policy spokesman of the opposition at the federal level, Peter Dutton, is of the opinion that today's announcement is only a "pavement solution".
"We are in the situation today because the Labor state government has withdrawn 430 million dollars from the health care system," he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government is pulling almost half a billion dollars out of the system and the Commonwealth puts 300 million into it and then pretends that these are good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually carry out the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without result.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered themselves into an impasse after a failed conciliation meeting.
President François Hollande received representatives of the association and the association on Thursday at the Élysée Palace in Paris and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained tough.
The strike, which was announced at the end of November, will now also be carried out, said the head association of professional clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The one between 29. November and the 2. December scheduled matchdays in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are therefore cancelled.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant church community of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the parish hall was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "idioms from the Middle Ages".
Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the church council, addressed the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called sayings like: Wooden eye is alert, as scales fall from the eyes, keep an eye on someone, the Lord gives his own in his sleep, washing his hands in innocence.
Several times, the speaker also let her listeners guess what the saying was.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took on the idioms from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, make blue, something spanked.
She explained the importance and origin of the idioms she called "bridges into the past."
Finally, a raffle was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and humorously circumscribed before being handed over to the winners.
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was also mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a Gottsucher, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Amazing the kinship in the exterior: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, like Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, is to be understood, one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet who is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two-thousand-one.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security delusion and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs hurt his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minority Report" dates back to 1956, exuding the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunal.
The principle of the "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime," meaning what is now more or less official White House doctrine.
In Dick's world, which is terrifyingly like ours, mutants look to the future - and the police are taking hold.
"We capture individuals who have not violated any law," the agency's chief says.
“We’ll catch them before they can commit a violent crime.”
And: "In our society there are no serious criminals, but we have a prison camp full of pesudian criminals". They read time streams.
They assume that bad things happen, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's narrative acts like the blueprint for the anti-terrorism laws and the NSA's eavesdropping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own prerequisites.
Not only does errors and sacrifices accept them, but builds on them.
The system creates the danger it is fighting.
Philip K. Reading Dick means, again and again, to get closer to the truth.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a female judge who had demanded changes to the stop-and-frisk program ("stop and search") of the New York Police Department, and relieved the judge of the case.
The 2. U.S. appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until a city appeal was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way in which the program for the stopping and questioning of people would be implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their policy and the relevant training programme.
The appeals court heard the arguments on the demanded suspension on Tuesday.
The appeals report stated that the judge must be relieved of the case because she violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted inappropriately black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms to policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were released again after a check by police.
An oral hearing on the city's appeal is after 14. March 2014 planned.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this nature have been around for decades in various forms, yet the number of recorded checks during the term of non-party Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, who belonged to all minorities, filed suit that developed into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police headquarters deploy the scheme.
Opponents believe the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; also, money would be wasted and the broader problem of a police force would not be solved, which is under pressure after the omission of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which was constitutional, but only reformed the nature of the implementation of the checks by the NYPD.
Anger over verdict for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 bombing in Bali reacted angrily to the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, since Umar Patek was to be shot in state law.
Patek, who was on the run for just under ten years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted persons, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in the construction of explosive devices for the bombing.
With penalty suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder over the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many more injured.
A guilty verdict was also made in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also referred to as a "demolition man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has sparked painful memories at June Corteen, a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the devastation wreaked by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"You should put him in front of a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with the fact that I will not have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was razed to the ground when on 12. October 2002 shortly after 2pm, a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked outside the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terror cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the carnage and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To keep him alive – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded arrest for nearly a decade, but was finally picked up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden nearly four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict was issued before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year, which is being made with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal against his verdict.
Spying affair over Merkel in Russia testified
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spying affair surrounding German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier, Greens parliament member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden as the first German politician in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
Leg almost chopped off: Reissue of rocker trial
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is being reopened after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily harm and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun in the district court of Frankfurt (Oder).
He is accompanied by strict safeguards.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and were among the Bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and smashing three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing group Hells Angels.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
It was preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about turf battles and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time it could not have been proved that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had been wearing masks and had not been recognised.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the verdict after the revision of the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the regional court for a further trial.
One of the defendants is currently in open execution for another offence.
At the beginning it was mainly about the reconstruction of the processes on the night of the crime.
As a witness, the then investigating commissioner was invited.
At the center were mobile phone conversations of the defendants and other people that the police had wiretapped.
It is difficult that rockers almost always adhere to a law that is more likely to be in court - and not testify.
The same goes for the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the public prosecutor's office in Frankfurt (Oder) said on request that new traces had emerged since the last proceedings.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new Bubi head.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous since her role on the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock his fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has split from her long blonde curls in favor of a platinum-blonde short haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look in Los Angeles on Wednesday and also put a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the moral change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

Slightly, the number of people without a job fell by 22 to 1,307 in October.
Although the rate is 3.1 percent better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the office of the agency for work in Sonthofen.
Because numerous companies have so far reacted subduedly in attitudes.
One reason for this, according to Felder-Bauer, is: "We hardly have any specialists in the crafts, in the health care and in the elderly care".
Due to the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been running again since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The entire background report can be found in the Allgäuer Anzeigeblatt of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Traffic lights on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the street does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What to do - drive in red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting period must be "appropriate", which can be interpreted differently on a case-by-case basis.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the traffic light.
However, those who continue the journey despite red light must be aware that they are tormented for an accident caused by this.
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker, referring to a decision of the Higher Regional Court of Hamm.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of permanent red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
A driving ban was spared him because of the special situation - but not the fine.
Loss of profits at Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturing company Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after coming under pressure from declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the railroad division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September, according to the ambitious schedule.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago was followed by only three more take-offs, which makes it clear whether the test phase will proceed as planned.
Results fell short of forecasts, leading to a price plunge of over eight percent on the Toronto stock market.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his rating from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the fact that the stock has limited price potential in the next one to two quarters.
"We are expected to see weaker delivery figures for aircraft, but we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector," Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft advances.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and first flew in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company’s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new jet airliner are accurate.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has not remained on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said during a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft's service life.
Each manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to make a first flight and then attach a revision period, which we did.
This happens throughout the flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to take off in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, it said from the company side.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether the first customer can put a CSeries aircraft into operation twelve months after the maiden flight.
Bombardier said it is reviewing the planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the coming months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter with end on the 30. September, Bombardier's net profit fell to 147 million dollars, respectively. 8 cents per share of 172 million dollars or 9 cents per share the year before.
Adjusted earnings per share are unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue declined slightly, falling from 4.2 to 4.1 billion dollars.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and revenue of 4.56 billion dollars, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division was 30. September 32.9 billion dollars, compared to 31. December unchanged.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest railway manufacturer, announced that sales in this division have risen by almost eleven percent to 2.1 billion dollars.
The order backlog in the transport division was 30. September 32.6 billion dollars and was thus against the 31st December slightly elevated.
The profit margin in the area of transport was affected by settlement problems with some major contracts.
According to the company management, there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares gave up 8.5 percent, putting it at 4.83 Canadian dollars, after it was also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will join the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones on take-off and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen regulations for such devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in "flight mode."
During most of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books at take-off and landing.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision, which U.S. airlines will have to do to do tons of work to implement, but are not pursuing any immediate plans to change their regulations.
The air traffic control agency CASA also stated that it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft," it said in a statement.
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions provided by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about expanding the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said it is open to change, but that they must be initiated by the legislature.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would stick to the current regulations until further notice.
"Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices must not be used at take-off and landing, and we do not currently have plans to change that," the company said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different effect on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the radio interference by mobile devices, and change manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs, and customer instruction.
"After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height," the FAA said in a statement.
In rare cases in poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of the FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is banging for a stake from Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he could only do it individually.
"We will decide on his stake in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his best scorer with six goals.
Because the Mainzers already have to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.

The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes are presented by the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The assessments were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this large exhibition.
Breeders of the clubs in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wicked hobby keepers their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the evaluation of the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show will be well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held by Mayor Hermann Arndt on Saturday at 2:30 p.m.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a raffle stocked with stately material prizes and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Seriously injured after clash
Early on Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are various witness statements that should be evaluated first.
It is clear that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that it took the fire department just under half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both victims came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully closed for about two hours.
British police issue Assange with extradition notice
British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought refuge and asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had sent the 40-year-old Australian a "call to face" that would ask him to appear in a police station, and added that if he did not comply, he would be threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden over the charge in a sex offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he had on 19. June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London sought refuge and the South American country asked for political asylum.
Scotland Yard "sent a 40-year-old man a request to stand at a police station at a time of our choice," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy made no comment on the service of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after posting over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the disclosure website WikiLeaks.
Revolutionary Work of Church Music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "Deutsche Messe" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
Saturday, 26. October, this extraordinary Mass from 19 during the evening mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and Sunday, 27. October, from 10.15 a.m. at the church service in St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des Stellessst des Saches der Masse", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the creation.
The Mass will be performed as part of the church services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog’s tail wagging with its mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail wagged more to the right (from the dog's point of view) while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain react differently to stimuli that evoke positive or negative emotions."
Here we tried to see this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right hemisphere of the brain was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail swirling of their conspecifics, the researchers monitored the animals while these films of other dogs looked at each other.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed the dogs movies with dogs – either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to use it to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog moving the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail tendency was mainly to the left (again from the perspective of the dog who wags), so their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience in which movements they should and should not worry about.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wagging with the tail in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces rather a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians and trainers gain a better understanding of their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, a dog behaviour expert and guest fellow at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, explained this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right was important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it comes to a satisfied dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following said: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when his ‘tail’ wags on the left and not to the right, rather than to become restless – the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could therefore stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can simply be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Tony Blair declared he would take the chance to return as British Prime Minister - but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic political issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers recover charred body
The fire department had to move out in Helmbrechts late Thursday night.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
Rescue workers retrieve a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident was still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
By late Thursday night, it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
By the time the fire department arrived, the flames were already pounding out of a window.
The crews went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the blaze, the police spokesman further explained.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Constance: Cyclist drives 63-year-old over
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening, around 10 p.m., with a lady's bicycle on the left sidewalk from the station square in the direction of the market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped on the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist could not brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and contracted a 15 centimeter long laceration to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured man to the hospital for medical treatment.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turners condition

UN announces new targets in poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for poverty reduction announced twelve years ago.
Ahead of the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals that expired in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to "think beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that the member states have agreed to embark on a process with which universal, sustainable development goals are to be agreed," he said.
“These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also intervened in the ongoing discussions about the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education in the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," Özdemir told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten.
Jazz and classical music are just part of the jazz location Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who is the favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22. September applies, the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is pushing for a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
Afterwards, the degree program Jazz and Pop from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim is to be relocated.
Pawnshops are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop in Singapore's Bendemeer shopping centre, Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a gold bangle, a ring and a pair of earrings to be able to pay for her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, that's where all my money is in it," says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) as an administrative employee every month and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax, where it made its swap, became the third pawnshop listed on the Singaporean stock exchange this week.
The pledges of jewelry are not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent that United Overseas Bank requires, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no review of creditworthiness or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops after families feel the pressure from rising living costs as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, lower- and middle-income families are looking for pawnshops to make up for the difference in the stuttering economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's described growing household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for Asian banks' creditworthiness.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product, according to the agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, an increase of 60 percent still in 2008.
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which has narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued export weakness and a slackening of consumer demand.
"In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible," says Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have further reinforced the trend towards pledging personal items as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items are gold in the city-state's 200 pawnshops.
People say to themselves, "The price of gold looks good, let's pledge Grandmother's gold chain and get back next month."
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has experienced a 20 percent increase in customers in recent months in its stores.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is financing that with 60 percent of Singapore's 66 million dollars, which it took this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawnshops not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers lend items they already own and the liquefying of personal valuables does not increase household training," she explains.
The pawnbroking business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term, hedged financing.
Nor are all people who use pawnbroking in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
"These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow," says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Rangnick scold for Schiris: Mane no swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sporting director of the "Bulls" was disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the swallow kings category," he took the two offensive swirls in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg.
The most recent reason for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane at the 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese became an alleged acting to the doom - which, of course, was not one, as the TV pictures showed.
"A stark wrong decision," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the match.
He defended his German compatriot with a dedicated view: "I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation."
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old insisted.
In view of the run of success, however, Rangnick voiced a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: really good," he said.
There is not much to suspend.
Above all, the way the squad plays is impressive.
I want this to continue.
There will hardly be any squad changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to make a difference.
"Except a player comes close with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
A study has been announced by the UK government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to realize high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was very pleased to be working with the UK Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2 is completed, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England of 32.7 billion. Pound to 42.6 billion Pound.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our destination for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we face a capacity crisis in our rail network.
Yet it is also about the link between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to "unequivocally" advocate Scottish involvement in the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link holds the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
That is why we are delighted to work as a partner of the UK Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland, which creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the investigative report with the UK ministers next year and to jointly adopt the next steps.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives fantastically.
Their house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
In the city it is only a few minutes by public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spiders?" Waltraud asks Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the concern of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition: Since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifties have had to experience first-hand what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book by her has appeared on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which type of living is the best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work in old age," she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today at the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deals with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most displace it as long as possible.
Only the others are getting old," she says with a smile.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, you worry.
"But then it may be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 living models for self-determined living in old age.
"But which form of housing you choose is always an individual decision," she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you can also be combined in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist book author gives residents to consider.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner flatshare.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and quirks
"For me, such a shared apartment would be nothing," she says with a wink.
Especially not like in a student flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In old age, you just need your retreats," says Ries.
The book author still does not want to rule out the fact that a senior living community can still function.
But this must be different than in the classic student flatshare.
And sometimes you just want your peace," she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, it is not alone.
"Most of the elderly in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible" is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Citizens' Service Life in the age of the state capital.
Her department advises people around the topic of 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often also accept inconvenience and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their usual environment, that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many ways to make the house or the apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who are concerned with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or apartment first of all thoroughly inform themselves and not to commission the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for the age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clarifies.
But the existing apartment can not always be redesigned according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
This experience had to be made by Waltraud Ries.
Although you could install a stair lift within the apartment, the path also paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the much bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before the move, she is more afraid of the spider on her apartment door.
NSA sucks up data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany investigate the increasingly explosive NSA spying affair.
According to the Greens member of the Bundestag Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence official would testify at a German prosecutor’s office or before an investigative committee.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Motorist seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was driving her car on the Kempener Außenring in the direction of Grefrath around 21:15.
As the left to the St. Töniser Straße wanted to turn, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The driving features collided.
The Aachen man suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league after six matchdays.
Now it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to the derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts anew for us.
"I hope that we finally have our heads free," Ehlers is cautiously optimistic.
He finally has his complete squad at his disposal, with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden, like us, is also betting on tempo play.
Therefore, we must keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase in the coverage, which has recently left anything but a safe impression.
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was a house number, of course.
But that's why we're far from the favorite, because anything can always happen in the Derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-juvenile Joost Windßuß, who is active with double-playing rights at the A-Youth-Bundesligist HC Bremen, celebrates his season debut.
If you are not hot in a game like this, you should stay at home.
Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug lords against police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld great Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyer who warned a drug lord of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld great Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash," who was praised by criminal investigators as "first-class," was arrested at his home in 2011 after police monitored Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched as Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while the latter was with colleagues at a bar association's dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were then monitored by police as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds as well as 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool's Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted cocaine possession during an earlier questioning.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigation into Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after he delivered the drugs, Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, retrieved the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after tests had discovered Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the suspected dealer because he was his client, and claimed her discussion was subject to "lawyer's secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office both at his home address and at the workplace and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was revealed that he had called key drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defense lawyer, as he has become too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but of a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these individuals.
Yet that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He countered the police investigations as much as possible, so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta dismissed any wrongdoing, claiming, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I didn’t, and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but do so immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: "Mr. Ditta has taken the step from a criminal lawyer to a criminal the moment he started acquiring drugs from organized criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to seek valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide trust and confidence among the public.
Ditta has betrayed that trust and tried to entrench herself behind the facade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three counts of possession of cocaine and obstruction of justice, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to engage in the heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other ́persons involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at the dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity inequality was the motivation for his work.
Until now, the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called to egg-throwing children twice, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains immediately, no property damage should have occurred.
Furthermore, some New Year's Eve firecrackers were probably ignited in the city area, but here, too, no property damage has occurred.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man found his wheel trims in the immediate vicinity all again, which is why the police did not have to continue to act.
A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165. Foundation festival to which the MGV had invited "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to come.
In the club restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the foundation festival is also always the right festivity to perform honors.
This time, the special award "Singer of the Year" was delighted to be the secretary Rolf Wagener.
"Not only did you write down a lot for us, but you also did a lot of rounds for us, but our heartfelt thank you," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for the participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and the last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Fifth place was taken by music attendant Artur Brückner.
The board addressed a particularly thank you to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured up a menu of the extra class and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for his regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 19:45 in the club restaurant.
"New singing voices are always welcome," says Schlotmann.
Council targets track facilities
Should the "Am Hirschen" level crossing be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros in hand for this.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at level crossings is to be increased - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they must contribute a third to the costs, the rest are shared by the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city master builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the local council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" level crossing.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the height of the tunnel mouth there west of the railway tracks.
There, larger vehicles, for example those that transport longwood, could also stand in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a required retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the local council, as some councils questioned the need for road spread: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money in our hands because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The level crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles up to 20 meters long could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the line serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it can be foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the railway crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be given an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
The councils agreed to have it examined what costs the planned widening of the road would incur.
Notwithstanding this, the majority of the reconstruction of the level crossing was approved with the proviso that the required retaining wall will be built in such a way that the city can extend the subsequent road in the direction of "Bahnhofstraße" for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters, if necessary.
The conversion of the level crossing at the tannery Trautwein, on the other hand, could lead to a completely different problem, which concerns the access to the sharply ascending "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the conversion plans of the railway examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, because it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was then easily possible.
The investigation concluded that it cannot be ruled out that the inclination conditions of the road could lead to longer vehicles being on.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road construction load carrier.
The conversion could therefore lead to liability disputes.
Since both the timber removal and the turning in the current state of expansion worked, one should not agree to the conversion of the level crossing, Haas argued.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because there is the central stop directly next to it, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the central station would have to be slowed down at this point to such an extent that no collision was looming.
The majority of the reconstruction of this level crossing was refused approval, since the city of Schiltach would have to "bathe out" the problem with the vehicles sitting on, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" to be unproblematic, for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
"Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun," Gazprom's chief executive, Alexei Miller, said in a statement Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to provide more diversity on Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas is stored for Europe, poses an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" off.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted tariffs when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
According to Gazprom, construction work is scheduled to begin in other subordinate countries on the planned route at year-end.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements like this will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements is thus eliminated - the noise level should be significantly reduced.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the setting of announcements that affect individuals.
For example, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning the noisy appeals.
By the elimination of these announcements - on average around 200 personal calls through the loudspeakers sound in one day - it should be quieter at the airport in the future.
"It has also been shown in the experience that these individual announcements were perceived relatively little, but at the same time all other information on changed airboards or departure times is a bit lost here," Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: barely a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, started to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay’s innovation has been expanded, as recently as the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline's stand-up institution, this year the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were too well-known at some point to perform at a club," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we can continue to work with them.
At this year's event, there will be performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as by "Stand Up for Heroes," an annual music and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which includes Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians participating in the festival this year have become known via rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic one, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the biggest visitor magnets at the festival is an interview: David Steinberg speaks to Larry David.
Steinberg started out as a stand-up comedian, but has become a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alley between two buildings and thinks to himself: Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum is called the visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24 and 25. August, as part of the summer holiday program welcome to a colorful children's and family celebration with numerous hands-on activities and events.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release reads.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, for every age there is something suitable.
The children are assisted by regional craftsmen from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
There is also a work off in the museum workshop.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or roundabouts, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or stilt running, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 2 p.m. respectively.
On a tour of the terrain, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are still lied.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the premises.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who will drive his scraping snack from 11 a.m. with the museum guests.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner is comfortable and fairytale-like.
The storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 3 p.m.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach will perform traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be looked over the shoulder during their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday program.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, state parliament president Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow comes from.
In the support centre Hochschwarzwald, he investigated this important question together with the managing principals of the vocational schools as well as the district high school and the parent advisory board chairmen.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasized Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, which presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, Kreisgymnasium and the vocational school centre in the Waldstadt.
He also praised the family-friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change," Wolf explained.
In addition, he stated that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"For those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies, with their acquired knowledge and skills, are often retained by the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the state parliament president was convinced.
Because only if sufficient training places were offered, the need for skilled workers could also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
In addition, he experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of local public transport on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Remain persistent and ensure that public transport gets better," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
Australian woman appeals jail time in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the verdict and has been released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially appointed by a provincial court in Phuket on 15. June found guilty of making a false statement after citing to Thai police that a local taxi driver had it in the morning hours on Sunday, the 10th. June, raped while two other men detained her.
Later, however, the footage from a video camera showed that she had safely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to having come up with the story.
Until the court hearing, she was in police custody at the scene.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence at a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player in the Australian Rubgy League who has reached out to the foreign ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We're obviously very worried, but we hope she'll be back home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is on a bail of 50,000 Baht on the loose.
In Australian reports, it was read that she is on holiday in the meantime in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
On the part of the court, it could be heard that Bamford would be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults.
However, it is also possible that after the recent murder of travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may be eager to improve its ailing tourist image, and therefore it comes to an acquittal.
The construction fence painted on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has beautified the construction fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
She also cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the back of the property had not been allowed for security reasons, because the site threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, this did little to disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative in their action.
Their motto on the big poster was "We are against ruins".
In doing so, she wanted to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - should the giant project fail one day.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the project of the city will be better for many, although not a few have the same questions for the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying these responses, according to the BI.
As can be heard, the mayor's public statements also have an effect.
May had said at the municipal council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal bath, should the population vote in the citizens' decision against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some therefore appear downright scared, others perceive it as a "plump blackmail attempt" on the population, according to the BI's press release.
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a surveillance group
Syria has destroyed key facilities for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas ammunition, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while heavy clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) arrived a day before the appointment
1. November, which the Hague-based organization Damascus had set to destroy or make "inoperable" all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule aimed at destroying all Syria's chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts say there is a production facility for chemical weapons and deposits here, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which is tracking the number of dead via a network of activists in Syria, declared on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On the 25. July the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This number has not been updated yet.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks, many of which have ties to al Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there had been casualties on either side on Thursday but did not give details.
The fighting underscores the danger to which the chemical weapons inspectors face, because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed its destruction.”
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are currently planned."
Earlier in the week, inspectors had declared they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites designated by Damascus.
Because of security concerns, the visit of two facilities was not possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been "abandoned, according to Syrian statement ... and the chemical weapons program objects present there had been relocated to other named facilities that were inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved next month by the OPWC's executive committee.
"I take my hat off to the bravery and courage you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization," Ahmed Uzumcu, the director general of the surveillance organization, explained in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong, a secession of Shiite Islam.
With more developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a strong explosion at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the worldwide official investigation into the alleged manipulations in the currency market is rapidly picking up momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with authorities on investigations into the world's largest financial market, where US$5.3 quadrillion daily changes hands.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the widening investigation, which is causing the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business.
The bank, which made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities.
"Our investigation into this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a previous trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is said to have been furloughed by his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was furloughed this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's Instant Message Group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma declared that it was investigating suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are combing through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks' trading units in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies is limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying it is nearly impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign exchange market, yet leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
A leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks means that “you can influence the market even with very low ticket prices.”
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced it had terminated a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of just under six million dollars late last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and worked with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair with then-Interior Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack and track Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson also called her and left messages, the court learned.
"In the opinion of the prosecution, Coulson, who is now editor of NotW, is not someone who stands in front of people's home and hopes to catch them red-handed, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction," Edis explained.
He said NotW is using three procedures to research stories investigatively: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows about the second, the surveillance, it can't be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies that, but we say, "And if he knew about it."
Rumours of a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editorial team when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, it's with Charles."
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaire's apartment.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
In the time the research was ongoing, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw monitoring of Pawlby's movements.
On the 18. In June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow, which I would like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as the former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks argue off to have conspired with others, between the 3. October 2000 and 9. August 2006 Phones to hack.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, research shows.
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is not an indication that puberty is now occurring quickly,” Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious indications of the development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair as well as body odor, are evident in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first menstrual bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to go to the menarch," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial, which is actually the beginning of puberty, but it is "precocious" when breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnant – something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
In the event of rapid progress, tests could be indicated by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending against another consequence: the premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the developmental speed, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reluctant to use medication, but he admits: “Suppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls’ feelings of being unlike their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at the age of ten.
Even if there were first signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home terrified and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media are the cause.
Boys, like girls used to, come into puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported conducting a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine, which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys have grown the facial and pubic hair earlier, the trend towards full previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even in babies and toddlers.
"We need to be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty," Dr. said. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This can mean having to have a conversation sooner than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
If you stay calm, the child usually reacts well.
Girls who blossom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs earlier than thought.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race thrills participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to tackle the circuit over the hill chains around the lake.
Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee announces this.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, were also numerous everyman cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two top-class junior drivers were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good placements at the German Championships.
These two were expected to set themselves off the field.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small lead in time to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was again able to place in second place.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nabtraum who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen came in second and third place.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to over 70 years among the oldest starters.
In the main race this year, even more absolute top athletes were at the start.
Four drivers were able to set themselves apart from the regional top drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, along with a teammate, has already been world champion in twelve-hour driving twice.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in the duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was an eyelash finale in the finish line in front of the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Just one second behind, the experienced Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Areane Blersch from Binzwangen secured second place ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized process of the event.
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter jets had attacked a target in Syria's port of Latakia Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The officer did not elaborate on what the target had been, but said it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
Israel has carried out air strikes on missile deliveries in Syria at least twice this year.
Before the precinct derby against Schalke, BVB supporters with luminous rockets had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced harsh consequences.
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic, which offered itself to the viewer until shortly before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
The main guests were heard with their chants.
The southern grandstand, on the other hand, where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no chants, no battle crys.
The podium of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint cheering, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand, a large flag with a "Section Stadium Ban" was flying lonely.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, became the first BVB player to enter the pitch, briefly cheered.
When his teammates followed, there was loud vocals and waving scarves - but far from everywhere.
Nothing was going on in central blocks 12 and 13 of the south grandstand.
Also, that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a celebration.
Only five minutes before the kick-off, the Capo climbed its podium - and the until then almost with hands graspable tension unloaded itself in a loud scream, when Dickel queried the mood on the ranks in the stadium as usual.
The last thing, as always, it was the south grandstand's turn - and finally, here again, as usual, was the loudest place in the stadium.
And at the latest when the loud prompt "Derby winner stands up" came up with kick-off from the south grandstand, everything was again as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired luminous rockets into the spectator ranks and onto the pitch - and almost hit goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was lately kicked off because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of the Dortmund ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement," the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from choreographing for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I banned that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras have been shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will determine a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be drastic," Watzke assured.
One can be curious how the reactions in the south grandstand will turn out.
What happens on the go with my email?
E-mail is actually called electronic letter.
Was the drafting of the Internet service e-mail similar to the conventional postal service technically the letter secret implemented?
In the conception of the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not take care to create a stable foundation for a contact-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
The email program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run on several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are traditional emails reading through the net on their way?
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the go.
The provider of the sender usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the receiver systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a troublesome and unwanted spam mail, which is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems like GMail, the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal options to intercept or take note of email.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an email can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to readily recognize who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes, according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While Yahoo Mail's shares had fallen recently, GMail was able to gain significantly from Google.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and daily routine yourself.
With Burfien, the state church has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full position to inspire young people to study theology.
Currently, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduating from high school.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-echrich: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud."
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to the people as chaplains.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from it.
Certainly, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians have a safe employer for that.
This is what suits the young people of today, who are not only concerned with careers, but with a meaningful job.
According to the state church, which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree program begin their vicariate.
In the future, it will be difficult to fill positions in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies provide a broad education.
You can even become Federal President.
Royal Commission hearing: Two YMCA staff accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord charges
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with sexual offences in connection with children before allegations were made against the child care worker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, as the Royal Commission for Child Sexual Abuse learned.
But at the opening statement to the commission, the YMCA had stated that it had "never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse in the organization."
Managing director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with misdemeanours with child pornography, and another in which one sports teacher from YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare told Gail Furness, a commission-assisting lawyer, that he knew about the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA has been recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest rating of four possible in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August of that year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, acknowledged that the management had failed "from me down" in hiring Lord and did not ensure that staff had been aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sex offences against twelve boys during his two-year work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had prevented staff from reporting Lord's violations regarding the safety of children.
Staff testified they had witnessed violations, including that Lord was alone with children, caring for them privately as babysitters, letting them sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and had children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for a child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was Lord’s superior at the YMCA Caringbah, was “very intimidating and very aloof most of the time.”
The managing director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they did not dare to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had affected their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare said he had told the YMCA NSW board that the lesson the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" did not involve reporting by employees, and the board had agreed to him.
Hare said the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations emerged had been taken by the YMCA's chief executive of the YMCA's children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, but this had been "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a child-safe organization during the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, a child sexual abuse expert, the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, training, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing was until 20. December adjourned.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At a length of around 120 metres, a sewer from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you can’t miss the cathedral.
The two towers rise up to the sky for around 157 metres and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors, who marvel at the two delicate church towers, suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne’s underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service center of Cologne tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the seventies, the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city, and therefore of the remains of the old city wall only what was not too big stopped.
Most users of the car park therefore rush past the Roman remains today and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods in the parking deck D2.
On display are about five-metre-high ruins made of palm-sized stones.
"It's remnants of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze recounts.
Before it goes back to daylight, Schulze lets the participants on the upper park level take a look in a dark, 15-meter-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which is unfortunately hardly noticed.
Next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants descend again into the depths.
We experience here the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the Praetor of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in good German means "City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult"".
And the praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here at a length of around 120 metres.
"You can walk along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want," Schulze cheers up the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After getting the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We're in the mikveh now, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washes.
To this day, in the lower end of the mikvah, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read through changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikveh will become part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is to begin shortly.
However, a few years will pass before completion.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point harnesses as well as a hands-free system.
Options range from increased brakes, a service package with support of bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to bowlers have changed.”
They are not all experienced racing drivers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as an achievable way to world-class events.
We are excited to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, and to prepare newcomers for the hardships and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this is going to be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will feature a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new story of terror to independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
That provides the keyword for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a barbed-wire-secured border along Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde bill highlighted the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe, but this did not matter in the headlines, as expected.
No one has mentioned that the EU member states often bend their strict rules if it is cheaper for them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-compliance with Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
So actually no story.
And one that has already come in the year that it is already like a fossil: For the first time I have heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe?
Why trade the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great plan for the unification of Europe, which was drawn up after the war, has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
Everywhere in the EU, parties that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a single currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – was able to secure almost five million votes in the federal election in September and thus effectively expel the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket, into which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the common currency, many people are of the opinion that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with the fact that national governments are causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels - a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States.
That's a crippling cost disadvantage, as we could already see in Grangemouth.
All of the world's wage fixed-ins are not protecting the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is coming up, especially in France, the former cheerleader of the EU.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which to keep Germany at bay and lift Paris on equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, with which the ailing French economy is struggling.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive by-election, pointing the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the electoral vote – a timely warning for the British Labour party that it cannot assume a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with their newfound popularity among the white French of the working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point to which I want to go: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become something like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may be sticking to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of ingratiating itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will stand in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the last consequence) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying Berlin and Brussels what they can put where.
I suspect Scotland could drive quite well in a looser European network, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to answer for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to then be forced to impose an austerity policy on Berlin and Brussels.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on aircraft (but not make mobile phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies from departure to landing, but not make phone calls, according to the new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the U.S.
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline, FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the air service personnel as well as the regulations for the storage of the devices in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines that would like to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Among those airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the condition of the plan, we could approve the expanded use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA announced in a statement.
Currently, passengers will have to turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not allowed to take them off again until the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light.
When entering the landing approach, passengers must switch them off again and must not take off again before the plane has landed.
According to the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on take-off, landing and on the tarmac, the FAA said.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted for the use of Wi-Fi at larger heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from this,” Glading commented.
We're honestly tired of having to feel like guards on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data below three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are encouraged to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when he had to publicly leave an American Airlines jet because he refused to shut down the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
Regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the Road Safety Administration National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert on national transportation issues on CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we from the FCC know that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
In some studies, there is talk that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966, after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication devices by passenger-carried FM radios became known, which at the time represented the latest technology trend.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not care about electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally provide much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when turning over.
But when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are stronger.
Among the advocates of easing restrictions on device use by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to determine problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he felt the disruption caused by the devices was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots talking about a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the shutdown of the devices by passengers in the event of an instrument landing in poor visibility conditions.
A grouping from the travel industry welcomed the changes, calling them a reasonable adjustment for travelers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety," said Roger Dow, CEO of U.S. Travel Association.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" visited the Pro7 star Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pig lobes, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham, which you get in every supermarket, be a quality product?
Uli, as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains the working methods of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and smock he comes inside the factory.
Jumbo also has to disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo spotted to strengthen at fast food restaurant in Waldshut
"I'm working here huge quantities," the TV-makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product, marvel.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what is important in terms of quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the ph value.
"I'm curious to see if you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens then," Jumbo said cynically.
Here, the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is still worth it.
The viewer sees that the disassembly of the clubs continues to be handmade.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine."
The trick: fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc in the jumbo is disappearing," he announces the test eating.
"It's really delicious," the TV star concluded.
This will allow everyone involved to live.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller school gym in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The Älbler were on the other side of the network with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadter, also due to age.
With the hard and placed serves, the Gönningers had an extremely difficult time.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks played cleanly by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz over the middle of the net and were not on hand in the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadters in all respects.
In view of this crushing and game-defining performance, the third set was then won a bit lax and listless to the 3:0 final score (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There's going to be on 2. November with the TV Baiersbronn, who was able to clearly prevail in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially when accepting the ball; even with the passes, the precision was sometimes in short supply and in some critical game scenes, the overzeal prevented the eye for possible point gains.
In this performance-wise very balanced encounter, however, the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed on the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment of both teams.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," opened Mayor Jens Häußler the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to be explained the planned measures, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häußler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the local council".
The flood, the Gechingen on the 15. May 2009, hit unprepared, was a drastic event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river basin survey had been commissioned with the neighboring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up plots as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
The planning is based on the protection against a flood that is statistically expected every 100 years according to the German Weather Service.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent surcharge.
In expert circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," says Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality being able to expect state grants of around 70 percent.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the funding would only exist if an overall concept was implemented.
For this purpose, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed.
In the best case, implementation can be started in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported), provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Stammheimer Tal.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
There was displeasure among residents of the old town, who suffer from an overload of the sewer network, even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is well known to the administration and initial measures have already been taken.
Häußler pointed out, however, that the guidelines for sewer systems are different than for flood protection and this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to interpret the sewer network in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be tolerated.
Dimensioning the sewers larger would gobble up millions.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One who wants to make the name a program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that manifests itself in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the café of the same name on Opschlag in the district town of Kleve within sight of the Rhine-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to remain with the pure déjà vu feeling.
Finally, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make an actual stay not only mental, but always tangible.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the inner workings on Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the helm spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
In addition, there are delicious cakes or individually sandwiched fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café on the Opschlag: In Kranenburg, they ran the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers are hoping for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"We don't have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two here want to appeal to young students as well as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The sympathetic owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more the Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Better said one.
Because the harbour festival was rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the ringed evening.
"Nice, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's thing.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of event evenings: "You can't do it right to everyone".
And with an event, I only ever address those who are also interested in the special event.
That’s why events will be the exception.

Jumbo manufacturers argue over seat width in face of large orders
Between leading aircraft manufacturers, there has been an altercation over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, which sets the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the seat width offered to passengers on long-term flights in the tourist class – not always those that airlines most strive for, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that mandates a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but U.S. archrival Boeing says airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21. November record orders await.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results given, which the new "mini-jumbo" design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" grabs 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide, allowing ten per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often hand out blows to technical details using advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant, and the title: “Would you accept that?”
"Boeing is proposing long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turbo-props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people are getting thicker, but airplane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by ten percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist circumference of the average male American in the 21st. Century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a 1950s seating concept when the average body circumference of the freshly christened "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations were carried out that showed that an additional inch (2.54 cm) per seat increased the quality of sleep by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus's figures on seat dimensions and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines shape the balance between airfares and facility.
The company also explains that according to investigations, the experience on the aircraft depends on more than the seat width.
“It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to be successful,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s cabin expert.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more elbow clearance, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming a topic that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollars by list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the sit-in layout is the driving force behind the standoff over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the 777X, with its ten seats per row, compared with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats on his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products," says Kevin Keniston, head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s indicated that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could come with cheaper airfares.
"Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777," says Mary Kirby, a cabin facility expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape measure with them to measure the set-up in the competition.
Even if they advertise comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more customizability of the cabins and offered wide seats at the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle out but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
According to lexicos, veganism is subordinate to vegetarianism, but it differs from this in a very considerable way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves the consumption of cream cake, ice cream or a strong Edamer, these feasts are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan lets away from all the consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may wonder, but on closer inspection, the vegan diet is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local health food house, which has a variety of special products available for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
For 13 years, the native New Zealander has been vegan, in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. "In 1997, I changed my diet and became a vegetarian."
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoes," says Proctor, who prefers synthetic leather to normal leather.
He realized that other everyday issues can be done without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor pronounces the vegan's maxim, which extends to all consumer behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact, being vegan doesn't represent a waiver, not an asceticism, but it's an enrichment." The assumption that the dietary change reduces the choice of food options, Proctor rather attributes to the power of habit.
And it was precisely these conditionings that made some well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And argues: "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should taste even hearty.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that's legitimate.
"It should taste good, but this is not only to reduce to animal food," says Proctor.
He did not suffer any health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood counts are good, I get checked often," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegansimism critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12.
"Because animals are nourished with feed instead of grazing in pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," Proctor finds.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to consume the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 scores are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go a long way for food procurement.
After all, there are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on the spot.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
"A lot of people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is also the case with "ordinary" finished products".
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed.
"There is a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partially better, results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonic acid instead of egg, with its vegan cheesecakes, Proctor could also amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has momentum, when you cook together, it has a new significance.
"The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been skeptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions, you have to act as a vegan with a tact.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor does not want to live an enclave.
And more precisely, the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not be as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There are fries everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or a vegetarian yuffa," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria he dodges pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting into it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to the people, draw attention to it".
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the Galley in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor has the wish that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a sure way to make most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially if you learn to understand that animal additives can also contain in peanuts as coloring agents, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
This is not the only reason why Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also cleaning products.
"Glarly you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to "It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or to stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger-pointing that strikes at consciousness.
Maybe he can’t quite make it to put down his habits, but at least he can teach the consumer to critically question his habits.
Bayern's basketball players optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"Nobody can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe of the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their only third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich team sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed to convert a 15-point deficit into a lead 13 minutes before the end, before Piraeus again gave the game a turnaround.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," Bayern Munich professional Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful throwers of the Munich, who had celebrated clear victories in the first two games against the Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and the Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could eliminate the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
More experiments are needed before human testing, which can take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so that a smoker does not experience a nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice given nicotine retained their normal level of activity.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, would have taken a "time out," the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
Yet the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, because it is turning liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for people, if it is quite sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
More likely, however, is that smokers would use it to stop.
“They know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel any pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to put off the habit,” he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting but at the same time warned that further research was needed.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also a heavier diet than necessary.
The plot, set in the France of the 1760s, tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young nobleman who is sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slips into lustfulness or sensationalism – and that’s where his problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told makes it a torturous penitent's shirt for the audience.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath in front of the 18 judges of the judgment, dressed in black robes, which is based on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the solemn ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
"Today, the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life - absolute freedom, a true democracy and stability," said 60-year-old Morsi, a U.S.-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been sharply targeted by the respective government since its inception 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer for the new president, and unlike the presidential pomp from the Mubarak period, traffic was only briefly stopped so that the car convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As a non-charismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the finish.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, declared to the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi drove to Cairo University, where he was to give his inaugural speech.
He was officially greeted by an army band that played the national anthem to which he listened in custody.
The military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people present in the university's largest lecture hall with chants from "The army and the people are a hand."
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, the University of Cairo developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi on Friday took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had assumed from the head of state driven out of office.
Yet by taking the official oath before the court and not before parliament as usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Herbstest, in the context of which he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colors of his men's singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now probably more than beloved choir is still great fun.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his loyalty to the association, he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, Pastoral Officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a certificate from the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association as well as a engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31. Autumn festival in the usual courses: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers department Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mixture of different choirs and vocal styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
Their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared them for the honor a little serenade - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's singing club Betra also sang classic choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durch durchstals".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - provided the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir took "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" from Antos Gus to foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk style "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" to foreign countries, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers' department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to local climes with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which kept the children busy for lunch.
Frontier Airlines charges for carry-on baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to US$100 from passengers who want to store hand luggage on their flight.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to US$100 for a piece of hand luggage and 2 dollars for coffee or lemonade, even if it was read in Wednesday's announcement that passengers were allowed to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it would charge US$25 if the fee was paid in advance and US$100 for travelers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the US$100 fee was aimed at moving travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate that amount," she explained.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are one way to persuade passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger at the boarding gate of Frontier may be allowed to take a piece of luggage free of charge, but the next person may have to pay 100 dollars for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to the gate.
The new carry-on baggage fee from Frontier does not come into effect until the summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges, but airlines like to resort to it.
They argue that transporting the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they wished it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, so far leave the fingers of fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge hand luggage three years ago and later followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the Spirit carry-on baggage fee would bring in US$50 million annually.
Sorensen, who used to hold a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what to expect at the gate if passengers were faced with the company's unusual hand luggage fee.
"The boarding process was among the smoothest I've experienced in my career in aviation," he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and palpable discussions at the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding ran like smeared."
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars demanded for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company explained that passengers who bought lemonade or juice should be allowed to keep the whole can and coffee will be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company had followed suit.
Frontier's move to charge fees for hand luggage when passengers are not buying directly from the airline is the latest initiative to target customers being directed to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to US$25 per ticket sold.
This provides all companies with an incentive to move passengers to direct purchases from them instead of through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began issuing only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, miles were cut again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A third-party air trip with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore only earns customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively when purchasing directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined 9 percent and flight capacity shrank nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get a grip on Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest High School got to know the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which in the evening light makes a special appeal.
Due to the time difference, the students were almost 24 hours on their feet, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day was decided in Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, it was over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of the 11. Septembers.
On the third day, the students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373-meter-high observation deck of the Empire State building, enjoying the view.
Afterwards, it was through the hectic hustle and bustle of New York streets across the Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity to slew in the fall sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, students have now arrived in their host families and are experiencing everyday school life at Weymouth High School.
For national and international investors, there is no way around Germany as a real estate location.
The economic framework data is correct, and the financing options are excellent.
This is the tenor of 9. Real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung was.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, has on the 9. Real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung pointed out.
According to Ulbrich, the view on the transaction volume shows how sought German commercial real estate is sought.
In the first three quarters of this year, it grew by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The teen's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in his high school's gym, are convinced their son was murdered, the family's lawyer explained Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was named on 11. Found January in an upright mat that stood behind the grandstand in the school gym.
Investigation officers from the Lownes County Sheriff's Office concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered," Benjamin Crump, Kenneth's attorney and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it lacks any logic that violates the laws of physics and against common sense," Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is covered up in order to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of their son.
"Her son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
That's what Moore explained at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts of whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I take the view that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from the consequences of a "position-related suffocation."
A second autopsy, however, resulted in another cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence to investigate Johnson's criminal or civil law, he will instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the county sheriff's authority was not immediately ready for comment at our request Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered Wednesday that authorities must release all surveillance video that investigators have reviewed.

John Kerry, in an unprecedented admission, declares that U.S. spying has "gone too far inappropriately"
John Kerry hinted with an unexpected admission of a softening U.S. posture regarding their surveillance programs by saying spying had "gone too far in certain cases."
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation on the part of its allies.
Speaking at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Quite without question, the president and I, as well as others in the government, learned of some things that have almost expired by autopilot, simply because there was the ability to do so, which was still to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, and of course to the 11th. September goes back.”
He then admitted as the first senior member of the U.S. government that U.S. espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said: "In some cases, that has gone inappropriately too far."
The President is determined to provide clarity, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be compromised.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop this before it happened?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the U.S. on counter-terrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to representatives of the European Parliament and other individuals this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism agencies due to frustration over National Security Agency surveillance.
"It is very important for the national security interests of the US that the Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who sits as a Democrat for the first time in the Senate and serves as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger at NSA programmes.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence agency said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents leaked from Snowden that the NSA had monitored Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence community, James Clapper, defended the spying on allies as necessary, declaring that this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his authority was preparing the congressional trip to be held this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MPs are due to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also said that there would be some "serious words."
He said European governments must be honest with their population about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
"Although we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is on a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the resentment of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and day-care centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
In cooperation with Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb, the Schwarzwälder Bote would like to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and crèches from the entire Zollernalb district can participate in the campaign.
If you have a building or beautification request for your facility, you can apply with it to the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Aktion Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury, consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the prerequisites for participation?
The wish should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many hardworking construction workers.
What is the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus provides the material with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and should then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, clubs and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit.
The mining magnate, who is in a court battle over paying 6 million dollars in carbon tax, made the claim when he wanted to wipe questions off the table about whether he was in conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which is important for deciding whether to cancel or cut carbon and mining taxes.
Yet Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
"He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive leave," Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it would take place faster.
Tony Abbott's daughters, Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote?
"We need a better system," he said.
Why should we not have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, dial immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils in marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
Tuning with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has considered the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office "very seriously."
A public office is about public service.
"We strive for no reward but that of history, namely, that we can serve this community at a critical time," he said.
Esa decides on major space missions: missions for billions
Far-off planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they plan to launch in the next few years.
30 proposals were available, five are still in the running.
Faraway worlds.
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life on some of them, at least, no one knows.
The choice is difficult: Should you look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover alien life?
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to decisively advance research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is about one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
In the next few days, a final decision is to be made by the scientific program committee.
The Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program, initiated in 2007, will find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, what circumstances can life arise there?
To investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems in our vicinity will be examined in more detail.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, thus looking for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also ultimately provide information on the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be examined by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Esa has already approved a mission of the M-Class (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, Esa envisages the first of the three L missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The "Juice" (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) probe is expected to begin its 2022 trip.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is intended to study the planet's atmosphere, as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could lead the physicists to a new theory, under the umbrella of which all known natural laws can be combined.
How did the universe come into existence and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we have in common, from which stars, planets and living things like we do, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of.
With "Euclid" the Esa has already approved an M-mission, the start of which is planned for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to study the distribution of matter in the universe in the entire sky for the first time and thus enable conclusions to be drawn about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could do the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, the best chance of obtaining an approval as an L-mission has "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
By this, physicists mean changes in the structure of space-time predicted by Albert Einstein nearly 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that were created during the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which is intended to explore black holes, among other things, "Icy Planets," another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism," a mission to survey the cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which is supposed to track down and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals for the return transport of samples from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids as well as solar physics have already been eliminated.
CDC publish allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines the U.S. government issued as the number of school-age children with food allergies is rising.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines include information for schools that are intended to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the Auto-Injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to counter a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed regulations so that schools can keep epinephrine in stock more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is on it” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Firefighters called to save a pooch who was stuck in a quarry 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rocky outcrop
Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a minor road accident
Three days later, she was spotted by a walker in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters roped off at rock face and rescued the dog from certain death
The fire department managed to bring a pooch to safety, which was stuck in a rock wall on a 15-meter-high protrusion.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel bitch Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who own the dog, arrived at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to get Ruby back in and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firefighters.
They had been desperately searching for their missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she escaped into the quarry after the minor road accident.
About 14:15 on Wednesday, a walker who carried out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the spot and roped off to the rescue of Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: “She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from above and the ground.
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate a few dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual effort.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was a chance she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To watch the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to keep her in your arms again.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters did great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson, of Keighley, added: "We were afraid she would fall down, but she stayed up."
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
US border: 'Super tunnel' discovered to drug smuggling
On the Mexico-U.S. border, investigators have discovered and shut down a "super tunnel" to drug smuggling.
According to the U.S. customs authorities, the more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railway tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized.
The tunnel had not yet been put into use, according to the statement.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig through under the radar," Southern California District Attorney General Laura Duffy said at a news conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where that had been discovered one end of the tunnel.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy assured: "If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them, we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money."
Both the U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 have been found in Mexico. 000 people killed in connection with drug-related crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about a year.
The track was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 metres from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depth to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters in height and 90 centimeters in width.
He would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was caught for the seized marijuana.
All three face life imprisonment as the maximum sentence, officials said.
Eight such tunnels had been discovered since 2006, according to the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities rather than through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the US.
No details were disclosed about those arrested, at least one was Mexican, it said.
You have to face prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama's pullback on health care policy
After intense criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his frequently repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, then you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a letter of resignation from their insurer, Republicans accused the president in recent days of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama put his original promise into perspective.
"The vast majority of citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep it," he said at a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the terminations, Obama urged those Americans who have received such communications to look for new insurance on the open market.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They're coming a better offer," he said.
The government described it as unsurprising that the five percent of the population who themselves have taken out insurance would have to look for a different tariff, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, stated that the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
That statement from an upset Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was recorded after a dispute with Republican Rep. Billy Long of Missouri. It was a question of whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed with the question of why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a state-sponsored insurance company in order to take out a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Parents of intersex children can choose 'gender indefinitely'
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with indefinite genitals.
Newborns are no longer rigidly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but can state "indefinitely" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure off parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for gender assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, maimed and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children are born each year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitals.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise that you should use the best available sexual assignment information if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide – if at all – for surgery.
New York Psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good cause."
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgical intervention, but for most children this does not apply," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child develops their gender identity in the first place is not very accurate.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret that people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people are distinguished from transgender or transgender people, because their status is not gender-related, but is conditioned by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically defines both at the same time or not clearly as one of them.
These properties were found in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the level of harassment, violence and prejudice crime.
Boys not matching the gender picture now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate on official documents male, female or "third gender".
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "sexless" person after a court granted the lifelong retention of a "not established" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third allocation in the future, X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, on the grounds that “if the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we are twisting two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Parenthood is already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your own child," she told the parent website.
Children need stability and safety.
Historically, children born with both male and female sexual parts were called hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Just ten years ago, medicine viewed gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are doubted, after it is now known how complex the gender identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong, because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender assigned by them.
“In the middle of 20. Century called this a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with indefinite genitals goes to Dr. John Money, of Johns Hopkins University, who took the view that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "sex identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses – as parents raise a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child and thus shaped whether a person considered himself to be male or female.
But in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan," his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a botched circumcision to completely neuter the child and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," Drescher said.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the Internet moving in, survivors of these sex operations have come out to the public, who are "not happy with the result."
Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoral or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should receive vaginal plastic surgery.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at my birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
Through the surgery, he has become infertile.
Today, he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to make intersex people perceive as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law could "encourage and stigmatize."
“Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to assign the child a ‘not fixed’,” she said.
We fear that favors intervention.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don’t know yet how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized as a third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force young children to do at this time.
When they are adults, they can decide on their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says the German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatry associate.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents space, which means they don't have to make rushed decisions," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and thus gives them time before they write "male" or "female."
In this way, everything is fine – you raise the child and love him.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parental happiness.
And you don’t have to hurry to do an operation that can’t be reversed.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that worries parents, because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea," is cut to the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his profession, acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago when fishing.
So the two just complement each other great.
One almost thinks to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman's boy Manolo speaks.
If Santiago sits tired of life bent in the chair, that's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is thoroughly a character role that Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage in long stretches as a single actor.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings about the attitude to life in Cuba with her songs and her magnificent voice.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Fancy ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice cream glowing in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of the marine animals and created a bright treat from them.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and Chinese scientists were able to convince to artificially produce the luminous protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company “Lick Me I’m Delicious”, says: “The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.”
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We have tested it in the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish phosphor is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes delicious for that.
Charlie's experimental Bristol-based company is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is set to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream."
This is impossible in and of itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to make it.
The ice cream utilizes the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conversation Forum
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday, 21. October, the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To hell with hell - Theological considerations on today's handling of the last things".
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, the Salem Palace and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how today the people classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries and had relied on those images of heaven and hell, "which still shape our ideas to this day", the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for completion was more characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been greatly driven out by Christians through the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
She said she had "supplied us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost our exclamation marks."
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is connected with the question of that longing, "which dreams that in the end everything may be good".
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The habilitation for fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the University of Wilhelms University.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has held a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hechingen: Fair gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake," said the philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to at least succeed in the wedding party were now given a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers around a wedding were represented.
A trend: The retro look has arrived again.
This starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, preferably covered or in cream.
In the front, the often ruffled and embroidered dresses are closed, often with a veil, in the back, on the other hand, they go down their backs and often end up in a train.
However, the spirits differ, as Stefanie Koch from the fashion house Kleidermüller emphasizes.
In men, the suit with vest and plastron dominates, but cream-colored or brown combinations can also be chosen.
The selection of the restaurant is important, it was explained.
Jewellery-free adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here, the domain drew attention to its own offer in the draw.
If you want to drive the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"Coaches are also popular for young female parties," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, flower arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more fashionable is the "after-wedding photo" - i.e. recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable celebration.

The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday slashed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid by him at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for US$4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that aligns search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit, which hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC make phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with the mobile products from Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google placed an initial bid of over 900 million dollars for the Nortel patents.
Google increased its offering several times and last offered 4.4 billion US dollars.
After it was outbid by Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for US$12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorola's library in patents.
"Although Google failed in its attempt to acquire the patents at the auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so," the lawsuit read.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google as it claims Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the accusation.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become sensibly more expensive.
The city's magistrate is deliberating this morning on a submission by traffic department Stefan Majer (Greens).
Parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the city council must decide.
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt thinks this is "not a good idea".
The parking facility immediately in front of the shop was "an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller specialist dealers".
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "entirely appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Oil price continues to give up to USD 96 per barrel
The price of oil also fell further on Friday after worries about a high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil grade for December deliveries had fallen 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in e-commerce on the New York Mercantile Exchange late in the morning in Europe.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a price drop of 5.8 percent in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that the U.S. supply had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, supply had risen by 25 million barrels.
Yet on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of an increase in activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, having reached its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude that is also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to USD 108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but eventually it goes home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Of course, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for this!
What could be more obvious than to go to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I like to be part of it when it comes to fast food picking up late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable.
Because what does one have to miss that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on the weekends, discarded paper bags are on roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or the next trash can?
It's not just that the paper stuff is ruining the landscape.
Bags have also already obscured traffic facilities such as guardrails and thus triggered accidents.
But what said "disposable society" does not think about, presumably it does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are on the road more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after partying nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage pile up there.
A few bags would more or less make nothing - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food leftovers of others.
I already see the day coming when the cities and communities are too stupid to clear away - and the fast food chains have to demand a deposit for their bags.
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quarker substitute.
The Vegetarian Federation will name others on World Vegan Day on 1. November.
The Vegetarian Federation of Germany will celebrate on the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1. November a number of vegan alternatives before:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt can be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk could be used.
Impactable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
A half-mashed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple sauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable for this.
Instead of egg, doughs become loose, for example, with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of cornstarch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can also serve this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people currently eat vegan, i.e. purely vegetable, in Germany.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can accommodate every car in the dashboard.
The devices that record every kilometer driven and report the information to the authorities are key to a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system to finance U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax assessments.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The American Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of privacy concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is really a must for our country.
"It's nothing we're just potentially going to use," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning a record of miles driven by all California motorists in the state from 2025.
The way we pay those taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from the taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is broke.
But in America, there is not as much fuel as before.
Cars use less gasoline.
The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 euro cents per litre) has not risen in 20 years.
Politicians, at high fuel prices, do not dare to raise the tax even by a penny.
"The gasoline tax is simply not future-proof," said Lee Munnich, an expert in traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system.
"This represents the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is appealing to urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the driving behavior in such a way that traffic jams and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California planners are relying on the system in developing strategies to achieve the state’s ambitious, legally enshrined climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also impressed by the idea of having drivers paid after the distance travelled.
"This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole," explains Adrian Moore, vice president of guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two previous American transportation ministers who, in a report in 2011, had urged Congress to move toward miles-based billing.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a 90-million-dollar pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
Yet the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push, responding to the concerns of MPs from rural areas representing people who often have to travel many miles in everyday life on their way to work or to the city.
Nevertheless, several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Most engaged is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees to the state instead of the petroleum tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how to introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical at the thought that the government could track each of their movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem," explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want to.
When the test started, Nevada's ACLU warned on its website, "It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult monitoring devices."
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is among a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can use to capture the kilometers they have driven, but not exactly when and where.
With that, Khan says, the public would also be more reassured.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The firm originally did not compete to help states with the taxation of motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are supposed to pay based on the miles driven.
But the devices it tested are also interesting for the street planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
"People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded," said Ryan Morrison, managing director of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs, big mistakes have been made.
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the miles driven by all state residents on average.
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officers want to develop a taxable device that also pays for parking fees, only has to pay insurance for kilometers driven, and speed data is collected in real time by other vehicles, thanks to which motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system," a city planning document reads.
Some transport planners, however, wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund's problem simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is enough," explains Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream come true for FC
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field lost nothing in the importance for the city and the football club despite the cold weather and the rain.
Everyone had wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason.
This went to the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as many speakers.
The FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, was therefore also wet.
He was especially grateful to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the municipal council, the companies involved and the members of the association who got involved.
Here especially Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sprightly pensioners laid 400 square metres of paving stones for the new paths.
The state parliament member Karl Rombach also paid tribute to this remarkable voluntary commitment.
Further greetings were given for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the southern Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office, who announced a donation to the club's youth department.
Mayor Klumpp recalled that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original grass court in such a way that it could not be used.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations to solve the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was considered.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up about the creation of an artificial turf sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete plans were taken up two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erbpacht, pledged a cost share of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and approved the land funding of 104 000 euros.
The municipal council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining 356 000 euros in the total cost of 560 000 euros, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter large artificial grass pitch took place on the 4th. June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3000 cubic meters of earth were removed, half of which was used for the creation of a dirt bike track.
Unknowns hurt girl by shot from car
Unknown persons have injured a twelve-year-old in a car in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators had fired on Thursday evening in Genthin probably with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
This was announced by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured in the left calf.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A slice broke.
They then drove away.
Criminal investigations are ongoing, it said on Friday.
Snowden ready to 'co-operate' with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the US intelligence agency whistleblower, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he has received asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin by Ströbele on Friday, he writes: "Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of allegiance and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible."
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges filed by the U.S. Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German representatives, then we find ways to make that possible."
Relations between the US and Germany are strained by claims that the NSA has wiretapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service, said it should take the opportunity to hear Snowden as a witness if this is possible "without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the US."
Ströbele, a Green Party MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, he would need an assurance that he was "safe" there, according to the deputy.
Snowden explains in his letter that he would face a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that drove him out of his homeland.
He was touched, however, by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have called the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance a merit of the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities of cooperation "when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Safety concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential figures
Thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique, to voice peace calls at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the country's future, she has traded her business clothes for a T-shirt that reads "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks now, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement initially backed by white-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict, yet recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal storage facilities in the northwest could bring investments of over 50 billion US dollars from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the USA in the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government provoked the recent clashes by making it on the 17th. October would have attacked its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos.
The assaults on the previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has been trying to downplay concerns about an instability.
Speaking to AFP, the French news agency, he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who "wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid a war.
But concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two adult men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) here who clash their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and a Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reform, has already declared it will boycott the November local elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as the attempt of an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial perks from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidential office," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacities Renamo has, but she has carried out trouble-making attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not good," Mazanga said.
The instability has further increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, the sluggish progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
"People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems," he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Hansjakob moves once again in Freihof
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years in the "Freihof" came alive.
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely entertaining scene.
From the arrival to the awarding of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that, under the direction of Cornelia Volk, received much acclaim.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explaining connections and bridging time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On 22. October 1913 Hansjakob comes home to his children's heaven, to his Freihof.
And then began the scene game in which Alois Krafczyk once again shined in his parade role as the city's great son.
He drove stylishly with the two-in-hand and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann knew it incredibly well to put herself in the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance.
To award the honorary citizenship, Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, who made his appearance on behalf of the then incumbent Hättich together with a part of the city council.
Her reception was subsequently made by the Three Kings singers, who led Hansjakob to the exclamation: "Oh, how beautiful, youth memories of my own Three Kings time come to life again".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud "Get out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time, as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of the war.
In the homeland, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene game.
There was a lot of applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after call
A Chinese newspaper that had demanded the release of a reporter on the front page who had been charged with defamation is to be reformed, a press regulator explained.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
Yet Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports about a part-state company.
Now the New Express will undergo a "comprehensive rectification," the regulator said.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several incorrect reports on the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator announced in a statement.
She said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and revoke his reporter's license."
In addition, the Yangcheng Evening News Group was instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant responsible persons be identified at the New Express and the new express leadership team was immediately reviewed."
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two appeals for his release on the front page and put himself behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television, admitting that he had published false reports against payment.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain the trust of the public," he told the state-run CCTV news channel.
I did it first and foremost because I was out for money and fame.
I realized that I was doing wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, explaining that it had failed to verify the reports correctly.
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely forced, despite a change in the law earlier this year, in which authorities were banned from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Löffingen: Köpfler still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a pioneering school, child, youth and senior citizen policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet registered.
As the only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer a candidate for age reasons, the 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen has so far been determined.
The application deadline is Monday, 11. November, at 6 p.m. from.
Haigerloch: Sacrament Church comes into focus
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city’s Cultural and Tourism Office will dedicate the last of its public themed tours on Sunday, 27. October, the Lord’s Supper Church.
After the visit to the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning conclusion is a visit to the Church of the Lord’s Supper.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the Protestant community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the Lord’s Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the one-and-a-half-hour guided tour is at the Atomkeller Museum at 3 p.m.
Maps are available at the cash register of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information, please contact the Tourist Office of the City of Haigerloch.
Mick Jagger explains he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" from 2004.
Perry explained that she had dinner with the old rocker, and that "he dredged me when I was 18."
She added, "That's been a long time and he was very nice to me."
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said on Thursday that he "categorically denied that he had ever made any attempts to approach Katy Perry."
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else."
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Her new album "Prism" immediately landed at #1 this week.
NSA declares that an "internal error" and not hackers are to blame for the website's crash
The shady National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight, because an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency explained in a message sent by email.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack (DDoS) was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unreachable for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Earlier, a spokesman for the NSA told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was "in no way" compromised.
Secret information is not in danger, according to the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, is now in the bright light of the public and faces sharp criticism after the revelations about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad, after the revelations about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data that were stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of targeted cyberoperation.
Snowden could testify in Russia, too
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the U.S. spying affair.
Representatives of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or also meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unspecified circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be resolved intergovernmentally, it said.
A departure of Snowden from Russia is practically excluded.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatens the extradition there, it said
Children should be taught myths and legends as “role models for life,” says an author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthurian legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, which is why Crossley-Holland advocated a "careful selection" of age-appropriate works.
"I think it's wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education," he said.
I've been suggesting this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that authors and teachers who were "excessively didactic" would "completely switch off" children, because in entertaining stories the messages were conveyed "subliminally."
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background if possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to convey hope.
Not everything has to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history, and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
You thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre appears to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its earnings outlook for the full year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects an adjusted annual profit before tax of between 325 and 340 million dollars, compared with 305 to 315 million dollars in its earlier forecast.
If the current target values are reached, it means growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of 290.4 million dollars in the period 2011/12.
As managing director Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre posted eight per cent profit in the first half of the year, posting a strong start to the second half of the year, particularly in the Australian and UK private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are on track for record annual income before interest and taxes," he said.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest earnings earners.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which offset a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Things went similarly well for Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK, while business customers also spent less here.
The US business rebounded from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so that a full-year profit is expected for the third year in a row.
Stocks of Flight Centre rose 3 cents to 38.20 dollars yesterday.
Falkenberg Discotheque makes for two great evenings

Fat beats and cool sounds are of course promised by the organizers on both days.
Post barely emptys on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for the Sunday emptying are still on various mailboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the fine print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you can quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP announces.
A request from the FDP has confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only in front of the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still emptied on Sunday, will not be answered in the answer to the question of the FDP.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to catch up here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially at Terminpost.
"This company is thinning this radical and unreasonable despite the price increase for letters on January 2013."
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberals’ parliamentary group and city association, supports his group colleagues: “What annoys me is the fact that the emptying times are changed or even deleted here.”
The post office is miles away from the proximity of the citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.
Also for the core city applies, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post did not communicate with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has advocated privatization.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on his split from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "life sometimes doesn't go exactly the way we plan or hope for."
Kerr and he himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
“We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and their son Flynn was born in 2011.
Haslach: Skepticism gives way to confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the basics will change in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is only one parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing more to change in the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day, it became particularly clear: the skepticism about the new one gives hesitant but increasingly a confidence.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the full-time officials of the pastoral care team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the new guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
In the future, SE Haslach, as a parish, will form a public corporation that will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual parishes so far.
There will only be a joint parish council and a board of trustees in which the parish priest Kraft Amtes is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called parish teams are formed in the six parishes on site.
In the future, their task will be to promote church life in the village.
When asked about the finances of the individual parish, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations provide that accumulated credits in the parishes are preserved for the purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, pass to the entire municipality.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the obligation of which all parishes will meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested in, which could be mastered by the individual parishes alone," Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach put into perspective.
Barbar Ritter, the chairwoman of the committee in the pastoral care unit Schutterwald-Neuried, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
They had set themselves the task in 2006, "Becoming one, staying five" and had to realize that this is not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council as well as the practical work of the parish teams.
The drafting will be made concrete in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget had imposed a stamp duty of 7% on apartments costing over two million pounds, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company rather than individuals.
Already, the revenues from stamp duty on residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which stood at 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 tax year, are exceeding revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increases in stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumventing, it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low taxed, regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"Yet this move could make some foreign investors more restrained about buying property in London, or stopping owners from selling," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten per cent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have become more expensive by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed steady annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four matchdays, the handball top league is still in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we finally win again.
"I don't even know how such a win tastes," Malmon expects a sense of achievement from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third-league reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet ripped out any trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have trained many players myself in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait to see whether there will be a reinforcement from the first," explains the SG coach.
In order to finally return to the track of success, the Malmon team must definitely improve compared to the past performances.
Especially in the cover work and the changeover game, it was last but enormously lacking.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely be better.
Therefore, I hope that my players finally got their heads free during the short break.
U.S. to continue prosecuting Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of leaking unauthorised classified information.
Therefore, he must face a criminal case in the U.S., said the spokeswoman of the U.S. State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Even Snowden's recent remarks would not change that.
Earlier, German Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbele’s remarks are that of a parliamentarian and not that of a German member of the government.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book, and it reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011" to find out if it looked better for Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national policy correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House employees, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the poll ratings to swap former Secretary Clinton for the vice president.
The potential change was a tightly-guarded secret within the Chicago and Oval Office campaign infrastructure.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers - including Daley, Obama's former campaign director, Jim Messina, and the former White House senior adviser, David Axelrod and David Plouffe - knew about the proposed change.
In Double Down, it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of the effort to exchange Biden despite her "close, personal relationship" before finally deciding against such a move, after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would "not significantly improve Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a whole range of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll ratings at the time, so we thought, "For God's sake, what do we do?"
While Daley called the investigations "bid care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that significant effort had been put into the campaign for re-election to find out if such a move would pay off in terms of the ballot boxes.
"In campaigns, not as much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don't seriously think about something," Martin explained on AC360.
It is not clear, however, whether Obama knew his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley said he did not believe the president was “conscious” of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was “possible” for Obama to know about it.
Martin added that “double down” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probing had reached Obama’s desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama didn't know about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Possibly," Martin replied.
Local council welcomes solid budget
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal council meetings, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal sack in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debts since 2005.
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a complete success in this sense.
This became clear at the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of around 7.6 million euros over one million euros was higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at about 1.8 million euros, was also around one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The asset budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned 1.5 million euros, it amounted to 2.5 million euros last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," according to Rothmund.
Since less investment than planned was made in the 2012 financial year, the supply of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around 2.1 million euros to a total of 4.9 million euros.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake such a work out of your sleeve," Gerster praised with a view to the annual account.
He and the local councils were clearly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good numbers that could soon cost citizens dearly.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality was able to do without high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, this has in turn repeatedly reduced subsidies from the country.
There are prerequisites for these grants from various balancing sticks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must present certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the topic of lifting rates, as there will be investments in the coming years for which we would like to have grants," announced Gerster in this context.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleiner Heuberg confirm their creed at the confirmation
In two church services, 101 15- and 16-year-old youths of the pastoral care unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
The church service was accompanied in the morning by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the Firm Sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The firmlings had prepared for the big feast day in the past months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners.
In different projects, they got to know different tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Desperation cry of an Obama voter
I have elected President Obama twice in hopes that change is possible
He says Obama has made laudable efforts that have been thwarted by Republicans' blockade tactics
The blockade policy doesn't excuse Obamacare's website issues, the drone strikes
Obama's memoir about the 2008 election campaign is a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book I believed would sneer up during the gloomy second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It's called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama for the 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient transcripts in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a speech away.
The election became a landslide victory and news anchors paused to show the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved to office in 2008, he had approval ratings of 82%.
And then I close the book.
Switching to the present again is a rude awakening, as if being torn from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of forced secrecy of homosexuality in the Army, and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, believe that partisan blockade tactics have tipped too many aspirations that our nation should be brought forward with: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration to colleagues and acquaintances countless times, I ended up with my attempts at explanation.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why the eavesdropping of foreign heads of state is allowed or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It can't explain why the National Security Agency is collecting data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished who disclose government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, and why public funding and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the findings of a report that says the White House's efforts to keep the media quieting are the "most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration."
And recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns preceding it.
Clearly, the MPs office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape the public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I re-elected Obama in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unfermented alternative, he did not seem to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
Yet by sinking approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into thin air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to pocket a heavy loss to Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his staff they needed to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this commentary are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Constance: Blocking after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
The accident had occurred, according to police, when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., in the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was on the left turn lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and changed to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer driving there.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW.
In total, around 15000 property damage was incurred, police said.
The roadway had to be closed during the accident recording, it said.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the municipal utilities, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a family of four people in Pfullendorf are entitled to 70 to 90 euros in additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This levy is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These quantify the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can charge through a levy on the price of electricity.
The municipal utilities Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher levy in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete pays would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," according to Bias, with the figure rather close to the 2 cents.
Josef Winkler has been writing the hardships of his childhood and youth from the soul for more than 30 years.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to bruised force and blunt sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - have been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is best known as a prose writer, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prose lyrics for his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in the Garage X at Petersplatz.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, his family belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a crumpled sofa on which significantly copulation and masturbating - the eight-member ensemble hangs through the textual material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance whitewashes the template with a wealth of directing ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses get their hands on the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, submerged with their heads underwater, stapled against the wall with their evening robes.
Forced into cellophane or bodice, they stake on dangerously high sticks through the staging, either monologue them loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this effort.
The best moments have the evening when singing - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk song material.
Only towards the end does the over-the-top performance come to rest, and Winkler's after-just absurd humor flashes.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants is growing
The chances of the league remaining of the sportingly relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wild card procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers is not applying for a possible back-up seat.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been putting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, a first sigh of relief was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure, as long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," Neckar-Riesen boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until 23. May, upstart Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration tribunal and prove its economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, however, the Rhinelanders have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last instance.
