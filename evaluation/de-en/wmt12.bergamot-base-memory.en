No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by Parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today refused to propose to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko had been convicted under an amendment to the Criminal Code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the exemption of the imprisoned Prime Minister, was rejected by the MPs at the second reading of the request for mitigation of the penalties for economic offenses.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for the conclusion of an allegedly adverse treaty with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicts is to be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself calls the ruling a political revenge of the regime and also in the West the trial raised suspicions of the court's bias.
The request to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the Prime Minister was convicted, from the Criminal Code was supported by 147 deputies.
226 votes would have been required to its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without it, the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As usual for this region, Islamists win in the elections, the question is only which - the moderate or the radical.
The National Transitional Council professed the common law of the Sharīʿa, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft, you can chop off the hand in short.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as quickly as possible, possible apostates of faith are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, society from mutually commanding tribes will be united by the Koran in the future.
In short - in Libya there will be an order that would hardly be imaginable in this country and, above all, hardly desirable.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only and objectively not the best and would hardly fit the aforementioned Libyans.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters were even helped by the unbelieving dogs.
To their apology may serve only the fact that the air strikes of NATO were not directed by any general from America, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after every successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only participated in an exchange of gunfire, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of themselves in the person of the dictator of a political ally, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are a concern - namely the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But do the petroleum companies get the black gold at a mock price even without occupation?
Hardly and so the West can finally boast with right of its selflessness in terms of the protection of human rights.
If this is not spoiled by the Shar'a representatives.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm low roared through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the 3. Quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, Germany and France increased.
The bond market is breaking all records today.
Investors are not only keeping an eye on Greece, but now also Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European Zone, Germany, Czech Republic and several other European countries published their preliminary forecasts on economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany's GDP grew by 0.5%, and that of France by 0.4%.
Both countries simultaneously corrected their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than had originally been expected (growth of 0.3% instead of predicted 0.1%), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (original data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent year-on-year in this year's third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to Tsch. Statistical office thus confirmed the trend of slowing growth in economic performance.
The results are therefore worse than the forecasts of the analysts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew 1.5 percent year-on-year in this year's third quarter, but it stagnated compared with the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the eurozone and the EU, the economy recorded 0.2 percent growth between July and September compared with the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent year-on-year.
The yield from its 10-year government bonds reached the value of 28.45%.
The yield on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds is below 4%, even as the situation in the region worsens.
In Germany, voices are heard saying that the ECB should become the creditor of the last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now celebrate their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a magnificent goal by Petr Jiráček, she won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not be missing from the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed reportage.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection also won quite happy 1:0 thanks to the final weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček in Montenegro and has thus redeemed her ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defensive game of the Czech team, they could only put more pressure on the Montenegrins in the second half.
The bad luck birds of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be part of the European Championships next year, it is also pleasing that domestic football will receive a premium of approx. 200 million flows.
From the first few minutes, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined lengthy and so was played mainly around the center line.
Even in the second half, the pressure of the home side was absent and the wide tees in front of the penalty area were successfully repelled by the Czech defence.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
A few hundred university students formed a living sign around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program before a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday lunchtime and subsequently announced death to the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Iran's Isfahan formed a living sign around the core technology center in Isfahan on Tuesday, where uranium is processed.
In doing so, they wanted to announce that they are ready to protect their country's core program, if necessary, with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran had apparently not given up its efforts to a nuclear weapon.
In Israel, too, talks about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed outside the entrance to the complex at noon and subsequently announced death to the US and Israel.
In the event of an intention-led attack to largely paralyze Iran's nuclear program, according to the Israeli press, the nuclear enrichment facility in Natan's target from the center in Isfahan would also be.
The menu of a fat-addicted child: It does not have breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of all pupils and 5 per cent of all children being overweight.
Current surveys have been shown - obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle.
This shows once again how important it is for the healthy development of a person, the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more common on the table than in families where normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of the overweight children had fries for dinner on the day before the enlightenment campaign under the motto "Obesity is no coincidence".
In families with thickenings, sports are not exactly one of the favorite activities, but this also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent replied that their parents find themselves at least once a week time for active exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, with almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic being surveyed.
This was already the second year of the campaign "Obesity is not a coincidence", which is supported by the General Health Insurance Fund and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4 and 8 have participated in the project. Classes part.
Unhealthy food and lack of movement in the family are crucial factors that are responsible for the frighteningly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, cited eating five times a day, in the mode of breakfast-second breakfast-noun-vesper evening bread - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," reads one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relative small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of the families of the students eat breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone eats breakfast for themselves.
Worst of all, the finding was that in every tenth family, it is not eating breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the cornerstone of healthy daily nutrition.
The survey test revealed, among other things, that unhealthy fries are consumed much more often in the families of overweight children.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed exercise, only less than half of their parents do so - namely only 15 percent.
Put together your own menu
Another part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own meal plan from opportunities offered for appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among their favorite dishes were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, sweets.
"Alarming is above all the great popularity of sweet sodas," is emphasized in the final report on this survey.
At lunch, the main course, pasta won just ahead of poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to Health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that the children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they get proper information.
"In the case of the control group of respondents who completed the questionnaire after the enlightening lecture "Obesity is not a coincidence", there was in many cases a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the results of the project stated.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet sodas, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also ticked poultry or fish much more often in the questionnaire than the main course of the day and were willing to eat less dumplings or sweet food.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I had complained a bit that was a bit too much material for the beginning.
I didn’t know what was to come.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how the "on the pitch" is going.
It's supposed to get worse.
The closer the exam approaches, the more information and practical tasks we are facing.
But even if the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully occupied.
This time we debated with Director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to attract a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And that's most of us after all.
Some have a too short neck, the others have a too young figure without decent curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal broad shoulders, to lengthen the neck or to conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to put on a woman type like Jennifer Lopez - so with big boobs, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging without it looking too provocative.
For example, if the difference between waist and hips is so great that the skirt or the pants really does not fit, you should at least have a piece tailored to your custom.
You certainly won't regret that, because well-fitting clothes are just priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in an off the bar, which always slips up and slip, stands out in the waist, etc.
Boyish figures can in turn allow themselves to wear clothing with pleats, blues, applications, embroidery or gathering.
With this amount of information and figure types, I'm glad I have a whole week to let everything go through my mind thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do given the applied homework.
Each of the students was assigned a celebrity, for which she should make up suitable outfits - daywear and evening wear.
We should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his figure type.
I'm supposed to "wear" Miranda Kerr, who you might know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I jubilate, because this is much better for me personally than, for example, attracting Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred kilos in recent times (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or also the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut the garments out of magazines or search on the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to the graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of the styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to concrete specifications, for example, trend handbags, coats, etc.).
This is what the stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about.
But that's not until Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall overview.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was spiced by three visitors from the industry:
by the stylist Jan Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to exploit this.
And sent-in stylist is able to work with a single piece of clothing in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over the jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on the naked body, put on your heel shoes and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks very different.
"Play with it," he insisted.
But the following advice came to me the most: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," Jakub said.
Finally I realize why we have to tamper all these teachings, what you can combine with what and why, even if you often see completely different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So you have to be prepared for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
So you have to expect all this in the design of the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed to us that image and style sometimes account for half of the success.
You just need Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, who has made a world star out of image and marketing.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are more reserved.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be thrown out money (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look is secondary).
And if anyone of us is already styling, then we should expect that he or she will most likely impose a very different (smaller) size on us than he or she really needs.
Then you only have to Google to determine with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has closed or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario advised us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must above all communicate with the people he styles and he must be a smart psychologist.
Assess people without showing off and standing by their opinion.
"If any manager orders us to see her closet and to add pretty pieces, then we can't clean out and tell her the whole closet - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to which you recommend what you can wear to it," Mario says.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So such a bag, which you button at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to such clear things, such as scissors, hair removal rollers or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (so the stylist helps to photograph products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are gathered at the back if it is too large (plugs or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and of course sewing stuff.
But in order for us not only to have to listen, but also to try something practically, we learned how to properly undergue shoes.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the sole of the shoe, let alone the outside.
We stuck and glued ourselves...
With the scissors you must not even touch the shoes, so that you do not damage them.
So you really have to be skillful.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without restrictions.
The mentioned skill is not exactly my strength.
All this was only the fraction of what we heard at the second weekend resume course.
One thing has become clear to me in the meantime - devoting to styling on a professional level is not a breeze.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
The originally carefree journey is caused by a series of completely avoidable, dilettante errors to the routine trip to the early shift.
Although it was possible to fulfill the ambitions to a large extent, but what good is this if obviously no one wanted to do a little more.
Even before he came to the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already year-old game series "Need for Speed" again a piece into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not only one of many action racing games.
We were also curious about how the fitted passages turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to with NFS, in the end, much is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially it's quite decent arcade races, but overall, the game is diminished by some superfluous errors that have been more or less present in this series for a few years.
So it is actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First, one is introduced to the story whose main character Jack has certain problems of personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the West Coast, you sit on the steering wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a number of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and into more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
You don't get a moment to get the impression that game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are also very pretty to look at, although the technical level of the graphic does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing world-moving.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through snow-covered scenery looks visually very pleasant.
From time to time, atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you will be surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts visibility.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are quite well installed one after the other.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (in principle a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then a personal duel with a single opponent awaits you.
And this is also the case with the police, who want to screw up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It is more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are much fewer such passages in the game than you would expect (in concrete terms probably only three).
Ultimately, this is more to the advantage of the matter, because so this element has at least no chance of getting boring - it belongs in the context of the above to the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model is following in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, seen from today's point of view, it does not tear out trees, on the other hand, one could not claim that it would be bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But an action-packed racing race will continue to do justice to the local driving model quite well, although you could find better ones with the competition.
Until then, everything is in the best order.
Real problems only arise after a while.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite O.K.
It is hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you do not know how the car behaves before any impact on any object, then obviously not everything is okay.
Typical example: When narrowly overtaking or passing on oncoming cars, you only "swipe" the other car slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you get into a skid and turn wild pirouettes.
Or the cart is about to go to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter anything, from an annoying thing it is all.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have total damage or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in every race you only have five restarts.
When you exhaust them, everything starts all over again.
The restarts are therefore more of a tool, in the event that something does not succeed, but you should rather not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, the restart does not even help, so nothing helps but to learn the critical section from the head.
What is very unpleasant is that the same things often happen in the same places.
Some curves, for example, you have to drive through in a very specific way, otherwise you just don't fit through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civil" cars in the same configuration, whether you come first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the opponent passes two oncoming cars in front of you, but until you get there yourself, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around or brake them.
And it doesn’t matter when you get there, because everything is designed in such a way that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The opponents have other advantages.
In the whole game there are a few places where you are always overtaken in the same place by the same opponent and again here without regard to the time.
This is the most crazy thing at the end of the game on the long bridge that you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake one here on devil come out.
And when he is already in front of you, he of course takes your view, so that you drive your own car in Klump a few times.
Of course - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly avoids you the joy of the game.
And that’s a shame, because despite a simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don’t know where your head is anymore.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what "guilt" is to do with it - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in a way that no boredom can arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the change of car in the course of the races.
You must not overlook the gas stations on the track, because here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have just has is enough.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for the urban areas, the strong American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical journeys, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story also goes the task mode (challenges) - so the races in the individual localities, which you know from the story.
Here there are not only medals, but also experience points for the own profile to win, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
To get to the higher driver level, various items must be unlocked: from the car, to the backgrounds for the profile.
This is also associated with the online function Autolog, which compares, among other things, the own results achieved with those of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of another incomprehensible carvings is a situation in the final race of history.
Here you come by car to a subway tunnel (mean reason), where you race in the dark on the rails long (because of me).
On the speedometer, digits between 150 a 200 km/h (my way), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives you uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial team we will probably argue for a long time whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that at some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this applies in particular to the accidents with a larger number of participants, where a continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The tone reproduction is so far O.K. and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to a more young audience as wide as possible scale, a soundtrack a lá "from everyone something" was created - but who buys such a game already because of the music?!
Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game were not diminished by the totally unnecessary mistakes mentioned, we could have claimed with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that's how the game seems kind of unfinished.
In itself a great pleasure, but one should be prepared for these mistakes with the power of airport headlights in the eye.

EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have the reputation of negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has put the balance among the individual institutions palpably out of sight."
I didn't expect such a hard war to be kindled.'
"It will be five or six years before the waves will smooth over and everyone will get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law quite sharply.
How seriously she takes the motto "Understandable and open about Europe", she showed in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual organs of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that it could have envied some of the lecturers of the Faculty of Law of the Charles University.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent chairman of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, criticism was voiced that he was too inconspicuous - a gray official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say, it has taken everyone's breath away how well he has taken on the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, to have clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy in response to the question: Who is this actually - the European Union? Which number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards agreement and better readability of EU policy towards states, such as China or India.
No one wants to ban us from our oil cap quargel
Ms. Vicenová also devoted herself to the agenda according to which the European Union lived, living and commemorating living in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency of two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organized the summit for Eastern Partnership.
She described the case of the government during the presidency as a major negative, which had severely damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the ambassador, it was not only the chairmanship, but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, quite hectic.
And the seven-year budget of the EU still has to be approved, which makes things much more complicated precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and economical budget, which economic sectors will take precedence, which countries will be more and which will be supported less - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans, with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe."
"If I don't like something, it's grayish abbreviations, foreign words and technical jargon that no one understands.
How can I, as a citizen, actually know whether one really thinks of crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes in Brussels or whether someone actually wants to ban us from quargel.
She would also have liked to have used the soil of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in prospect
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics who perceive more the negative than the positive sides of the matter.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
This is due to many factors, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also raised the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, which said so-called V4.
"Believe me, if a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and there's a Slovak nearby, then the Frenchman next to me means: "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?" and makes a pretty sour face.
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects hard rules for the budget policy of the member states in the future.
As much more real, as a "European Federation" it sees the concept of one of Europe of two or even different speeds.
"We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries away from the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the institute of a strengthened cooperation."
"For the first time, it has been said that only the countries that want it and those who do not want it should stand quietly away should work together."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which ultimately amounts to a strong "Europe of different speeds,"" Ms Vicenová expects.
In this respect, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle, according to which all issues with impact on the entire EU must be discussed by all member states and not only by the eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
Innovator IBM is entering the second century of its existence
If you wanted to look for a suitable word that characterizes IBM's strategy most accurately, then this would probably be the word "longevity."
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The foundation for this longevity was already laid by their first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already took the slogan, countless worldwide problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a bit.
His slogan "Think!" thus became a trademark in order to reflect the life of the future giant (and at the same time the title of the company's internal magazine, which was started to be published by IBM in 1935).
This was also the basis of the company culture thoroughly prepared by Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thinking means a continual movement towards the future.
IBM survived and was successful for a whole century because it has remained true to its principles and did not shy away from changing everything else around.
This allowed us, in the course of our first century, to transform the technologies, the business and also the society.
We hope to create even more in the next hundred years," Samuel J said. Palmisano, the company's current director on the occasion of the anniversary.
Thoughtful system
Watson already ran social care for his employees in the 1930s - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid leave, an insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as workwear and a well-thought-out remuneration system for best newers and traders.
Also ingenious are IBM's long-term relationships with its customers.
The company was brilliant in talent promotion from the beginning - as one of the first companies worldwide, IBM lifted any discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that Palmisan at the helm of IBM will be alternated by a woman next year - is also - by Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has taken the position of sales, marketing and strategy chief.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming, which is what makes many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, in the company almost half a million people is employed.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unwavering position in the business guarantees the company a strong image and this both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Economist Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems using technologies," added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, it is a difference to only be present in the market or to form it directly through this presence.
IBM - in the states of their logo called "Big Blue" because of family, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies ever - IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM has the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include e.g. ATMs, credit cards, financial swap, barcode or even the floppy disk.
With approx. This year, IBM was the second largest technology company (equal to Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
The look ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - for example, the attempt with their own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on the forward movement, so you must not emotionally bind yourself to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms - and if they don't work, leave them again.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
IBM’s profits are largely attended by services, software and hardware are participating in one-fifth each.
In 1990, hardware with a more than fifty percent share was still the most represented.
Since 2000, IBM has sold little profit-dropping assets worth 15 billion dollars, but in the same time it invested 58 billion dollars in the purchase of promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept across the world for the first time like a storm.
Here, too, IBM remained the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson faithful, who increased his investment in the midst of the great global economic crisis.
So far, it seems that the company IBM survives today's crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares has risen 120 percent rocket-like since 2008 and the company's net profit is growing continentally.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - just the values not.
This is another reason why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also handle the next crisis.
IBM history: From cheese cutter to space flights
Founded in New York a hundred years ago, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
She took over the name IBM only in 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a branch in Canada and South America.
The foundation for the later company IBM was the merger of four companies, whose history until the 1980s. Century goes back.
They possessed technologies such as the famous lancing card clocks to register the start and end of work.
Charles Ranlett Flint became the architect of this new company, who also held the chairmanship of the Supervisory Board until 1930.
And it was Flint who was the boss of rival company Thomas J. Watson hired to help him manage the company.
This leader even eclipsed the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still based today on the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began manufacturing and distributing all possible machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled its revenues to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable for the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to develop artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, technicians and computers from IBM helped NASA conduct flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn, and in 1969, man's famous flight to the moon.
Meanwhile, IBM developed the first computer family with the same computer architecture in 1964 - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC that determined the computer standard of that time was released in 1981 under the name IBM 5150.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consultant part of the company PricewaterhouseCoopers and thus fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off in the last three years is the concept of "Smarter Planet."
It embodies the intention to use technologies in a clever way in areas not even planned, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and city administration.
In the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the "Smarter Commerce" platform, which is intended to help traders lead the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
Already in 1932, IBM founded a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia - the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Central and Eastern Europe headquarters is located in Prague and here is also a top world-class research team that deals with the technology of voice recognition.
Darina Rychtářová on her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - You can keep this donkey, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become their lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still remained the hope that Joseph would wake up from his pink dream and come home.
But now it is finally over with patience and for the further life she has set herself clear rules.
"Josef can come home, but nothing more than my partner," D explained. Rychtářová.
As Darina Rychtářová the singer I. Bartošová had offered refuge in her own house, if she had not even dreamed of how it would turn out with her husband.
When Iveta moved out and back to Říčany at her insistence after 30 days, Joseph immediately went along.
He even publicly confessed that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned, even as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the running pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář Iveta should leave Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not welcome open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to decide his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person to whom I still have certain bonds," Ms. Rychtářová revealed; but she also said that she had already separated from him emotionally and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked his back door has so far been borne by Josef with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm sticking with Iveta, that doesn't change."
"My wife wants paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company keeps running, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the property, I do the shopping."
"I talk to Darina as normal, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to seek a new love, he does not want to prevent it.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who that is.
I realize that's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and that's why I take all responsibility.
The worst female dungeons: What about you?
If you ask the men to name some typical female virtues, then they invariably shake some out of the sleeve promptly.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few immoralities that let the men want to swell the blood in their veins?
Shopping addiction
Does their husband accuse them of being shopping addicted?
Do you need to buy at least one sliver weekly?
Do you like to go shopping and can it be a little more with promotions?
Then your case is really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their shopping pleasure under control.
But hand on heart, which woman can already stroll through a clothes shop in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try everyone (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even if shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times they've told their husband - you'd better stay outside...
Constant discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I'd have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or do gymnastics?"
"Do you even like me?"
Does that seem familiar to them?
Yes?
Then you probably belong to the women who are obsessed with how they look.
That doesn't mean you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife is constantly whining about their appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are increasingly incompatible.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's a battle against windmills.
Cleaning windows, swiping tiles and dust, chafing the tub - and this at least twice a week.
Scolding with your partner because he is once again trampling on the clean tiles with dirty shoes, you scold the children, because the just chafed sink is already dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet already has fingerprints again, when polishing makes so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that you must not overdo anything and that order and cleanliness in family life are not the first priority.
This excessive purity fiddle can ultimately also harm the mutual relationships and especially the calm in the family.
Stings
"Dirty gym pants come into the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put on the old socks again tomorrow?"
"A wet towel isn't just thrown on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that this puts him on the palm.
Of course, this is not bad, they just want everything to have its order.
If the men knew this, then the women may not have needed to complain so much.
Gossip and gossip
Some women like to clap and gossip, there is behind the back whispered or even slandered or one forges alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to pant through such topics, such as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably each of us women has a bit of harmless gossip and gossip in stock.
Hand on heart - that's probably all women's own.
But this is not to be confused with gossip of the coarsest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is holy, who probably despise everyone in their environment and who pose a considerable danger especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia to victory with their assistants
The hockey striker Jaromír Jágr had a large share of the 5:3 victory of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina in the Monday game of the NHL with two assistants and is thus again the most productive Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old ice hockey star was Claude Giroux in both cases, who added an assistant and was declared the best player of the match.
Two assistants in the same game were also recorded by Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček.
Jágr claimed to journalists after the game that he had predicted a big evening for Giroux.
"Even before the game, I tell him that he's going to do a hat-trick today."
I kind of felt that.”
"Every now and then such a feeling comes over," explained Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored a goal on the first shot of the Flyers.
A bit later, the second hit also had "a Czech lane."
Voráček fought the puck behind the goal of the Hurricanes and placed it between the circles to the successful Maxim Talbot.
A second before the whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third then belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr, he scored his third goal, after which Wayne Simmonds steered his shot to the fourth goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but certainly he's among the top three," Jágr paid tribute to his center.
"I wouldn't have thought in life that I was playing with such a hockey player at the end of my career as I did with him."
"I'm very happy about that."
"I'm cutting my game towards me."
"All the years in the NHL, my teammates set their game on me and now the skewer is turning around," Jágr smirked.
Carolina still made play the drama - by the hits of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came up on a goal.
Matt Read, however, prevented any further complication in which he was successful in number two against one.
"Excellently, Pronger was still acting in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last hit of the match from his point of view.
Through this victory, Philadelphia put itself at the forefront of the Eastern Conference.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav Špaček injured in the game against Buffalo and retired in the second third because of an injury to the upper body.
In addition to their experience, the Candiens also lost their lead in the penalty shootout 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not turn one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points hurt the coach of the home side probably the high illness-related failure on the defensive - the game they played only with five defensive players to the end.
"This is bad."
"We only finished the encounter with a single experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done, we have to deal with that," Jacques Martin said.
"With every change, one wave of attacks after another and we had nothing to oppose it."
"We should have made the game easier and put the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," P said. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec fought off thirty shots from Tampa Bay, contributing significantly to the 5:2 victory over Winnipeg.
Five different shooters played a share in the gates of the Jets, which hereby ended a series of five defeats.
Travel prices since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five approved state travel agencies in the ČSSR at the time: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies sold only trips to the socialist Eastern bloc countries, in the West at that time only chosen.
And so Czech tourists travelled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to Lake Balaton.
A clear exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore the trips to Yugoslavia were severely restricted.
It was a great paradox of those socialist times that it was not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (i.e. the Czechoslovaks) allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of the ČSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge queues or stay in the sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, things hadn't gone long.
The so-called. Foreign exchange commitment - the condition for leaving the West - was only granted to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so it would have been impossible to find the necessary financial resources (Western currency) for a trip to the West without a foreign exchange commitment.
Most Czechs, therefore, spent their holidays domestically, no wonder the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and daches - a habit that continues to this day.
The velvet revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution of the Czechs on the foot.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their foreign holidays in countries around the world last year.
A huge paradox, which one is no longer aware of today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday country of the Czechs - Croatia until 1989, because it was part of the then Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the obligation to exchange for foreign exchange was lifted to the neighboring Western European countries, which provoked a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough of their travels to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech holidaymakers slept in the tent in the park when traveling to Paris, because who would have had the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a guesthouse at that time.
A typical feature of foreign trips from Czechs at that time was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and permanent sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech krona - after decades our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our living level and thus also the average salaries increased, which led to another important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies began to regularly prepare for charter flights after 1997, making air travel incredibly cheap compared to the past thanks to the ability to negotiate volume discounts.
At the end of the 1990s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already had forefrontless payment transactions with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel came in 2000, when the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - to Thailand - thanks to the high demand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to far-flung sunny countries every year; this year, twelve exotic destinations are flyed directly from the Czech Republic.
About 100 Tsd. Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On the 17. In November 2008, the US lifted the visa requirement for Czech tourists, which definitely placed our country among the highly developed countries of the world.
In 2008, the Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time and for the first time in their history they gave more than 15 thousand for a single holiday stay including the costs at the holiday resort. CZK per capita.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
For almost five months, Czech football has no chairman and threatens that the successor of Ivan Hašek at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
To date, there is still no agreement on the election regulations to be elected.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties would like to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek resigned from his function, prompting his colleagues to agree on and find a strong personality who could lead football in the future.
Only - in the post-Hašek era, the old quarrels broke out again between the two association chambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was clear and clear on the 16. September, when the new chairman was to be selected.
The delegates of the Annual General Meeting had come to the Volkshaus in the Prague district of Smíchov for nothing, because the negotiation led to no result and it was not only about the election itself.
One could not even agree on who is actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the representatives of the statutes or the functionaries equipped with a power of attorney.
This single point reached at least partial agreement, to which the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law also contributed, the opinion of which, in the opinion of which, a representation on the basis of power of attorney, was not permissible.
However, the disputes over the election regulations continue.
The Executive Committee also did not bring any more clarity to the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - nothing else is on the agenda in principle.
Even if the views on the election changed a few times - the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how should you be in the 3. Take action to avoid a stalemate situation?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model must be found," Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of the FAČR, who represents professional football in management, noted.
According to the statutory model, in the third round, the candidate who receives the greater percentage support in the chamber for whom he is running wins.
Moravia is supposedly willing to compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, in turn, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense at all, this mode would call into question the entire two-chamber concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would best not bend the election regulations, but to vote according to the valid statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees, even if it is clear that the statutory electoral order is most likely to meet Pelta by all candidates.
"My wish is that it is largely elected according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical replacement variants are devised, as at the last Annual General Meeting," explained the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and in his statements especially Pelta delimited himself.
Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also work together constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly contribute to the calming of the minds."
"When football only rides on the euphoric wave, the willingness to cooperate is also greater," says the functionary from Jablonec, who has the greatest experience of all three adepts and this both on a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambiguous."
"This is not a matter between the people of Bohemia and the Moravia, but there are certain efforts to "bend" the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a renewed blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"However, I hope common sense ultimately prevails," Rajchl said.
Only - a lot of time to agree on all sides is no longer.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete at all until the qualifying match.
The charter aircraft, with which, among other things, Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl were to fly to Podgorice, could not take off in the morning in Prague because of a technical fault and so one was feverishly looking for a replacement variant, how to bring a part of the executive committee to the venue of the first leg of the barrage.
Ultimately, the meeting at ministerial level is decisive, which is supposed to come to on Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to persuade the divided parties within the country's largest sports association to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state grants, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming Annual General Meeting of the ČSTV, which is intended to point the new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
Paclík goes into the battle for the chairman's position because he doesn't see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen footballers, could have identified a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have engaged in the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good contender, I would fight for him and give up the election."
"But in the current situation, it failed to find such an adept," Paclík ČTK said.
So the main reason for Paclík to go into the duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from getting to the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to carry out the function of chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of the chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in the football event.
"I spoke to some people in question personally."
"It's hard to believe that some told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to have changed," he said.
Most of all, Paclík reportedly disrupts Pelta's association with the chairman of the Pilsen district football association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For this reason, it is unacceptable for Paclík that Pelta would hold the position of chairman.
"In his victory, today's state of affairs would be preserved and in Czech football it would not go ahead at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football," Paclík stressed.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name fell some time ago in connection with telephone interceptions for investigation in a corruption affair, but from which Pelta emerged free of penalties.
"I don't know what prestige a victory of Pelta the (ch.) Football should bring in.”
"And how would we stand in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who said his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsner football club if Pelta becomes chairman," but already sees it a little more calmly.
Should Paclík win in the Thursday election, however, he could certainly imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
The same is what another candidate thinks - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the Annual General Meeting in October, which ended with a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's able to lead the association as a manager."
"I'm not stuck with my nose in matters that I don't understand," said Paclík, who caused a stir in September that he was behind the removal of the refereeing commission with Luďěk Macela at the helm, which Dagmar Damková replaced.
Paclík himself claims he feels grown to the role of association chairman.
And invokes his skills in the management of private companies, since last summer he is also head of Pilsen, who celebrated the first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football environment and contribute to a certain cultivation of this."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups who tend to influence disciplinary and appeals commissions, which degenerates into disgusting situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy, for example, to Sparta chief Daniel Křetínský.
As one of his priorities, he would see the strengthening of relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby the political politicians for more money from the lottery tax to flow into the sport.
“This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should devote himself to.”
"If it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but then they also have to say quickly and clearly where the money goes," he said.
Paclík also does not see his connection to the Pilsner Klub as a handicap, although he himself emphasizes that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta, in turn, is associated with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not exactly ideal."
"However, it does not make much sense in my opinion to make a hypocritical transfer of my shares in the Pilsner Klub to a third person in order to return after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which will in future exclude a stalemate situation.
Two days before the Annual General Meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that in the event of his election, he would make a strong case for the FAČR to get new statutes, which will exclude disputes over the electoral regulations from the outset in the future.
The functionary from Jablonec is confident before the Thursday hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself in the eventual success of the Czech selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would focus on the national team and the acquisition of finance in the event of his election.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last Annual General Meeting and so the two-month break would help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and present it in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the association is headed by someone, says the man, who is mainly connected to the Jablonec club, but who also acted for many years at Sparta and the executive committee.
This is another reason why he thinks that he has sufficient experience to lead Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, bylaws were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they had not allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
He used precisely the revision of the most important document of the Citizens' Association as a lure for the delegates.
"Should I become chairman, I take on it personally and am ready to take personal responsibility if it does not work out."
"That's a principled thing he can't be without," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to distinguish himself from his opponents.
Earlier, he had announced that he could imagine a collaboration with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes because of his legal education and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
In football, he has been moving for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his election campaign."
"This is another reason why many doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who probably remains true to his proclamations, which he already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest game classes, to the national team.
And this should be the figurehead of Czech football.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Causa Bohemians, to the reverberations of last year's corruption scandal."
"Right after that, I would rush to negotiations with the private and state sector to ensure sufficient funding for all of football," the forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios accompanying the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not go to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
"If really the only contentious point should be how to choose in the third round, then we get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it only regains it when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his functionary career.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the previous deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Annual General Meeting on Thursday, this would supposedly spoil the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that in the event of his choice, one will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and hold the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football, and otherwise continue the work that the previous chairman Ivan Hašek has begun.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national selection, professional football, to performance football for the youth."
"I don't want to say that I want to do everything alone," Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and therefore want to distribute the competencies in the executive committee in such a way that each member is dedicated to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football in every segment can move forward with mileage steps.”
Many would not be excited about this because, instead of just criticizing the work of others, they would now have to start working really hard themselves," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, it was considered not to run at all.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it makes sense and that people are behind me who don't constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take," he said as an explanation as why he hesitated.
"A lot of people told me I shouldn't give up because otherwise others would do it."
"That's trust that you're not allowed to squander," he said.
He is also said to be motivated to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years we've done a big piece of work and I don't want to just throw that away now."
"Proceedings have been launched that will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would be reluctant to see someone stop them," he said, expressing his concerns that in the event that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would be elected, the situation could return to the times before Hašek.
"I believe in systematic action and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make football so that he would only be there for the chosen ones."
I guess I can be accused of a lot, but not that I'm partisan."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone is fine and not just the chosen one," Rajchl noted.
He also disagrees with the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even though some people say the opposite, I really plan to do the best for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which then each ascended to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsner Klub Tomáš Paclík has now also joined the fight for the function of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has elected me its vice-chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of kronor for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations for the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the association not pulling together in a single strand.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to help Czech football to new confidence," he considers the second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"Should he be elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek initiated and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things in his favor," Rajchl judges his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in UFO look, pomp pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience your blue miracle - and after a city tour or a hike, rest the tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
If Iris Meder went on a research trip in the past year and a half, one thing could not be missing in her luggage: her bathing suit.
Backling lying on the water, she looked up into artfully designed domes, she swam towards marble putts waiting for her at the pool edge, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she took it in her notebook - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools explored architecture historian Meder in this way - and now introduces her in her recently published book "Badefreuden": Volksschwimmhallen in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Through 13 countries she led her "trip to the most extraordinary baths in Central Europe": in addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder - only in the water is different.
Annoying only that swimming fans have to come to terms with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birdsong in the park.
"I was wondering one day why swimming pools must always be so ugly," says the Vienna-based Meder.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splash in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real treat: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, springboards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found a nitrate-containing water in a quaint karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath, whose pools are filled with alkali-containing water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Spectacular views, on the other hand, offer many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria: While you have the whole city in mind from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can enjoy the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton look out over the snow-covered Arlberg - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can observe the hustle and bustle on the ski slope.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO just landed in the Alps.
From three bowls open upwards, it steams in winter, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not every swimming pool, the pool collector Meder climbed the smell of chlorine into the nose.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the Árpád bath in the Hungarian Békescsaba it stinks so much like heating oil, which you hardly believe to have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkaline hydrogen carbonate-containing medicinal water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to the skin as soon as you glide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing spots: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech town of Bad Luhatschowitz, she found a closed-off terrain.
The bathroom, designed in 1902 by the architect Dušan Jurkovic, has since been closed.
When Meder glanced through the weathered windows of the red-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds proliferate between the tiles.
The decay, on the other hand, was counteracted in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath already has three phases of construction; not only neo-Roman elements, which date from its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, which was added around 1900, can be discovered.
Since the careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of the pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally from the Black Forest.
"It's already a feat to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank lets commodity business shine a light
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank giving up its business on agricultural commodities?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg -
For Germans, the matter is clear: 84 percent of Germans find it not acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn, according to a study.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions pull out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report that Foodwatch presented in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges are driving up prices - and the banks are therefore partly complicit in the global hunger problem.
The campaign of consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank CEO Josef Ackermann, even if big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike the U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to examine the allegations and said no business was "worth putting Deutsche Bank's good reputation at risk."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be completed, then the results will be presented to the Executive Board of Deutsche Bank - including a recommendation on how to deal with it.
At the end of January, the top of the bank will announce what consequences it is drawing.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity business, or even the complete departure.
Ackermann tinkers with his image
Foodwatch CEO Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but also reiterated his criticism of the financial industry: "Betting on rising prices of food shows particularly drastically how recklessly banks are damaging the common good today."
As the top banking lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly committed to the obligation.
"Deutsche Bank must remove all investments from its portfolio where money is used for betting on food prices," Bode said.
"Whether it's Mr. Ackermann about hunger-suffering people or about the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the Group CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before his departure from office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, unlike planned, the chief executive will not move to the supervisory board.
With a departure from the controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And in order to make possible losses, he hardly needs to care - that would eventually have to do his successor.
One in two would cancel commodity plants
Foodwatch is making an effort to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have already participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Institut Forsa on 7 and 8. November 1001 people interviewed.
Just eleven percent think it is legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which prices for food are betted.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank is participating in such transactions: according to the survey, one in two would terminate all investments where money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances from such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about canceling their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The reschedled pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy ending: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion of Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and lost.
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition house.
When raving about modern post-war architecture, clear shapes, glass halls, bold turns and new building materials typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels World Exhibition is an apt and famous example.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so well known that he also built Austria’s pavilion at the next World Exhibition.
With his legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like branch building in Munich, he finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, which was planned as a temporary exhibition building, was erected after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden at the Vienna Südbahnhof, rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20. Century opened - the "20s house" it was called.
However, the building was not spatially and technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art in Vienna got a new house.
Since 2001, the building has stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used in the future as a museum for contemporary art.
Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the house belongs, opens the first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new start was completed by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, a doctoral student in art with a considerable career, among other things, in his youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, strongly enforced the conversion among politicians and preservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined the use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, a café and a bookstore were to be available, and an office building had to be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, small budget
For the implementation, Krischanitz was the ideal occupation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was an "enormously important place" for him, where he had looked at the exhibitions "almost every weekend."
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which lost its generosity and ease when it was transferred to Vienna and its conversion.
There were far bigger problems with the current conversion: The building was "an energy slingshot," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass facade were replaced, glass-fiber-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel beams have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been refurbished.
Two basements brought space for the new use, a lowered light ditch between the house and street provides the exposure, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light tailer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish brown rust protection shade.
And the cinema hall is even exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also pleased the monument protection office," says Krischanitz, pointing to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such an architecture "always stands in the wrong place" and still wants to "arouse a real awareness."
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban planning stroke of luck has occurred: Around the Swiss garden, the completely newly planned "main station district", with office and residential buildings, is currently being built.
And another stroke of luck will perhaps still occur: The 21er Haus could get reinforcements from another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporary Kunsthalle, and as you can hear, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborly location in the Swiss garden.
Railway plans winter crisis package in the millions
The railway has devised a crisis plan designed to prevent train cancellations in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train cancellations and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments of a total of around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
This should achieve better availability of vehicles and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, a doubling of the internal and external employees for the removal of snow on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people is planned.
The aim is to free platforms from snow and ice within four to five hours by the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessary points for operation.
Two months ago, railway boss Rüdiger Grube had warned of train cancellations and delays this winter after a top meeting with government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had significant problems in passenger traffic, as it lacks reserves in difficult weather conditions, among other things.
For example, numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The railway has also been struggling for years that it has to have axles of ICE trains tested significantly more often in the workshop after an ICE in Cologne's main train station had an axle break.
Deutsche Bank to pay million-dollar fine in US
After the tumult around boss Josef Ackermann, new trouble comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now also catching up with its past in the USA: The Frankfurt Institute pays in a settlement 145 million dollars (106 million euros) to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five large cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It's about selling mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a number of large banks of having tempted the cooperative banks with false promises to buy the financial products; they would have downplayed the risks.
Such papers lost great value during the financial crisis and took the banks into the deep.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to move to court," a Deutsche Bank spokesman said in New York.
The bank admitted no guilt with the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed to the payment of 20.5 million dollars.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the welcome of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US cooperative banks and jumps in at bankruptcies to protect the customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billion-dollar damages incurred.
The comparisons now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also buttoned up other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble burst in 2007, it became a doom for a variety of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers overturned.
Even if the events are already several years ago, the banks are currently blowing a sharp wind in the USA.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits to receive redress or punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has sparked the biggest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having over-advantaged the two state-owned U.S. real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions in the volume of around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit brought by the FHFA, which involves several transactions worth a total of 14.2 billion dollars from the years 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that Frankfurters stand up for "substantive losses" without, however, giving an exact sum.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the claims as baseless and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought up shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies could only be poorly forecast.
However, he has now read IBM’s annual reports and changed his mind about investment in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM primarily offered services and procured computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett's investment is considered a knighthood in the financial world.
As a result, the IT veteran IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Buffett has now revealed on the US economic channel CNBC that he has bought IBM shares worth 10.7 billion dollars since March.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway has thus risen to become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 per cent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM knew anything about the commitment so far.
He praised the management, which had still provided for decent gains even in the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on the lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had been more likely to avoid tech firms to date.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he also understands.
Instead, Buffett accessed a freight railway, for example, at a lubricant manufacturer or machine builder.
In addition to around 80 subsidiaries, his holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and expanded it with clever investments to one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Still, his lifestyle is humble.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unmistakable sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the Buffett investment became known, IBM's stock rose one percent pre-market.
"Big Blue," as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he did not want to get in.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is palpable
After the uncovering of the "Zwickauer Zelle" Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
A newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now revived.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small business owner in the years 2000 to 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being reacted to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, this is a long-believed ghost: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
That there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimension is far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk."
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators is said to have been a V-man of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish community of Germany reacted calmly: it reminded the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated in a ceremony of the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, the togetherness had been staged - as a story of success.
The coverage of some Turkish media seems like a slap: "Germany's gift to the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the background of the murder series.
The German edition of the "Hürriyet" also does not hesitate to draw this mental connection.
"It's starting to smell," is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people have been murdered who have paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work.
The action of the police and their later search success is discussed extremely critically in German-Turkish Internet forums.
The authors are surprised why the German authorities had not already much rather thought of looking for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some, at least rhetorically, are prepared to use drastic means: "If there is still a slut here, the migrants have no choice but self-defense and armament".
“This will be the best self-protection.”
"The goodness of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network very strongly depends on the inner peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What it means when the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen in the nineties made clear.
The photo of the Solingen fire ruins is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, that suspicion and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
The attacks, however, sharpened the sense of we on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press at that time, the failure of German politics after the attacks was criticized: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a stem of condolences to the Turkish President, but was represented at the funeral service in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech at the time how many levies the local Turks made.
As if a person’s value is calculated according to the amount of his tax levies.
The current coverage of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since.
In addition to the efforts of an extensive enlightenment and reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, open words are needed this time.
The Scandal Bank of Lake Zürisee
Europe's most adventurous bank is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German is supposed to judge it.
Axel Weber certainly didn’t think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank in July, it became known that he would start an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Swiss major bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career step.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS whether its newfound solidity and dropped friendly remarks about the future colleagues.
“UBS has made the turnaround.”
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
But it became clear in September that everything would be very different.
A UBS dealer in London had circumvented all of the bank's hedging systems, squatting around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker not only praised in Switzerland, had to leave.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has since also been considered battered - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board in May - not until 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
For Axel Weber, this is going to be tough.
He is not a banker, but an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed a training period.
In one fell swoop, he then assumes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proved once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank."
Because UBS is huge on the one hand - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand has been slipping from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
The image of the secretive and solid, but also exhausted Swiss asset manager had combined it with ambitious goals: it also wanted to become a very big number in investment banking.
In 2007, for example, UBS managed 1.6 trillion dollars more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, she had advanced to the league of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The former banker and later long-time banking professor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "I always presented UBS to my students at the time as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I be so wrong?"
He was hugely mistaken.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something went wrong in UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli surprisingly resigned, who until then was considered a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker.
A few months later, it was known why he had left.
The bank's investment division had gambled with subprime papers and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs.
But she actually found investors, but some of them, some of whom would have sniffed their noses until shortly before: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund, which was so secretive that you did not even know your name.
But that was only the first blow.
It got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still the second best paid Board of Directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the disaster followed: UBS was facing collapse in the face of its malinvestment in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The National Bank bought UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion Swiss francs for a forced convertible bond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shaken - because it noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it hosts such large banks.
After all, UBS’s 2007 balance sheet total was more than five times the economic output of Switzerland (see chart).
"Again, we could not save UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The second followed the first disaster.
Just a few months later, UBS surrendered in the tax dispute with America and agreed to release the data of wealthy customers who may have evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, she agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions including a penalty premium.
Thus, UBS confessed more or less openly to having helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, she lost something that had always been her capital in the competition for rich customers: the nimbus of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customer funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: investment banking due to the misspeculation and in asset management through tax evasion assistance.
And just when things got a little quieter, just when it was thought that UBS would be able to do it again, this unfortunate dealer story follows: A single trader gambles 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: With the risk management in investment banking, it obviously still does not work.
"With the Adoboli case, it has been found that risk control has changed too little," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the banking institution of the University of Zurich.
The Chief Financial Officer of a major German bank is also certain: "The problem of UBS is that it does not have risk control under control."
It was precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago to become guardians of the great fortunes of the world: not too great a risk, but security for money - may even beyond the Alpine republic collapse the world.
The vaults of the Swiss banks had become a symbol of unwavering reliability such as Lindt and Sprüngli for particularly noble chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is only a bit larger.
The situation is already classic.
The bank is headquartered on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which leads directly from the main train station to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as the confiserie Springli.
For centuries, Swiss banks have resided here: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
The reception room of the UBS is entered by a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are marble-clad, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bench logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: safety.
However, both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have replaced this idea of the Swiss bank at some point - or reveal how the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, he, like all Swiss bankers, also does business with the two major banks.
UBS has become far too big, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first gave it high profits and then the debacle: no European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the Swiss big bank.
On the 15. The disaster became apparent in October 2008.
"That Wednesday, the ruling coalition of the small seven million country decided the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash."
Up to 68 billion Swiss francs or around 45 billion euros were approved by politicians to save the major bank facing bankruptcy.
How could it have come to this?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of Switzerland’s three major banks merged into a huge corporation.
A bank was created that was already too big for small Switzerland during the merger - and continued to grow.
This helped to ensure that the two different predecessor banks complemented UBS: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer but already more internationalized.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers came cheaply to a lot of money, with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, humble, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the belly person who has worked his way up from the banking doctrine to the very top."
But Ospel finally relied on Wuffli.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were the reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
What is clear is that arrogance came before the fall.
Employees of UBS clearly remember the executive meetings on which Group CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Goldman Sachs pushes from the throne.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the League Tables, the rankings that documented the success of the banks of that time.
That's where UBS wanted to go, to the very top.
Some steps had already succeeded.
In the foreign exchange business and stock trading, she played at the top.
However, management consultants who were commissioned highlighted a weakness: in the international interest rate business, in the banking language "Fixed Income", there is a huge distance from the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime investments.
It developed into a huge machine that packaged and passed on securities to American mortgage loans – but also retained risks itself.
Even when other banks were already looking to get out.
"Even in the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
So big the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up were more difficult than thought.
Posts at UBS became the slingshot seat and are still shaky to this day.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He needs to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all the obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: to end investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking is expected to shrink sharply, that much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank chief Sergio Ermotti will present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly separated from predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: He should lead the business of UBS permanently, the Zurich bank announced on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to push the investment bank back to the mid-1990s.
He cuts 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does she want to make money from?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is sure to ask himself now.
Publicly, he only says so far, he will look for an apartment in Zurich with his wife.
Next year.
Fears of recession in Europe weigh on US stock market
The threat of recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the start of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome were without clout.
The cursed industrial production on the continent nipped hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the changes of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass was still considered half-full last week, not half empty - but now the problems have again come to the fore, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financial stocks in particular were on the sales slips.
The Dow Jones index of defaults traded at the close of trading, down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points.
In the course of trading, the market barometer commuted between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, a minus of one percent.
The index of technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax bid farewell with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 eurozone countries has significantly reduced its production and is gearing up for the end of the upturn.
The companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to the statistics office Eurostat.
That made U.S. investors sceptical: "We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to free itself from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do everything possible to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, in his view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the top and entered the U.S. technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and initially had it listed almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at 187.35 dollars.
Buffett has paid an average of 170 dollars per piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Shares of Bank of America declined significantly more than the market at 2.6 percent.
The house silver-plates almost the entire remainder of its shares in China Construction Bank, pocketing 6.6 billion dollars for it.
With the net profit from the business, the institute wants to cushion its capital ratio and thus meet tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased and thus limited the losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul aircraft of the type 777 on Sunday and estimated the value of the order at 18 billion dollars.
Including options to 20 more machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, about 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values increased, 2281 declined and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, sales of 1.38 billion shares closed 630 up, down in 1913 and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows are spreading in cities
In many places, seed crows are considered "problem birds": but the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities, experts claim.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: Crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities, residents' complaints about dirt and noise of the animals accumulate.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer available from the cities, experts said at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian town of Leer.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out.
Are you looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of the particularly protected seed crows: The use of chemicals in agriculture increasingly destroys the traditional habitats.
The hunting, increasing development and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs are available in Soest, Westphalia, in the northwest, including in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen, and in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project to kill crows in the county had caused negative headlines.
Critics had described the catching of the animals in bird traps and the slaying with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal displacement, the debrising, is of no use," the city and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer has noted.
Spraying nests with water or cutting down trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dodge, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Disturbance is only conceivable as an exception at hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away anymore."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of the debris of the animals from sensitive living areas and attracting offers is conceivable in order to resettle them in other places.
"Infotafeln instead of chainsaws", on the other hand, the psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens advocated a completely different approach to the animals: "After all, we can best endure a pimple on the face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberg crow trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of the highly intelligent seed crows.
The project is already being accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and skill of the animals are legendary: seed crows not only use aids to get a treat, but even produce their own tools as a tool.
Behavioural scientists from the University of Cambridge recently tested on four seed crows how far the intelligence of the birds extends.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to collapse a scaffolding with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape of a stone in order to collapse the platform.
In a second attempt, the smart crows then had to solve a trickier problem.
In a vertically positioned cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had put wire pieces on them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket on the handle from the tube.
Three of the four seed crows even succeeded in this immediately.
Cristiano Ronaldo blasts Portugal to 2012 European Championships
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup remained.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and also Ireland will be present at the European Championships 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have released the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth European Championship participation in a row perfect after the 0:0 from the first leg.
The Czechs were handed a 1:0 (0:0) in the play-off second leg at outsider Montenegro, after the first leg (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia also did not burn anything at 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland took a loose 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted trade metre (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had twice cut short for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed Portugal in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got a tailor-made start.
Ronaldo chased a free-kick from around 30 yards to the early lead into the stitches.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range shot qualities and scored from 25 yards to the 2:0.
The Bosnians, who did not take place in the first half-hour, had their first clear chance through goal-scorer Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburger from the English leader Manchester City put a header to the lower edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding took centre stage.
After an attack against Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark gave a controversial trade metre after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely converted.
But after the break, the runner-up of 2004 made everything clear with four hits.
For Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek finished in the 81st. Minute also the last doubts.
The European champion from 1976 will go to the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
The team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg), however, were also lucky and had to survive a scare second in the initial phase.
Final man Petr Cech prevented with a reflex at the last moment a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had their greatest opportunities when duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40. Minute from the spin from the penalty area boundary just narrowly past Cech's goal.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had pulled away (50.).
The goal just before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks in Zagreb did not get beyond a 0:0.
While national coach Guus Hiddink must thus almost certainly vacate his place on the bench of the World Cup third of 2002, the Croatians can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship final.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got off to a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit only the post in the seventh minute with a distance shot, attacker Kazim Kazim also could not sink the bouncer in goal.
After the scare, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croatians didn't let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who from the 62. Minute for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic made way, were still Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship participation in Germany since 1988.
Stephen Ward brought the team of coach Giovanni Trapattoni, who had already made a preliminary decision with the 4:0 success in the first leg, in the 32. Minute in the lead.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) equalized for the guests.
Ireland pushed for pace from the start but had to go until 23rd. Minute wait before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead.
In the 32. Minute, though, was the time.
After an accidental defence by finalist Pavel Londak, Ward was on hand and pushed the ball over the line to 1:0.

SAP to double number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
Around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are to flow by 2015, the Dax Group said on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," co-chief executive Bill McDermott announced at a customer show in Beijing.
The workforce is expected to grow from the current roughly 2500 to 4500.
The number of branches of the world market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
SAP is currently present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4000 of the world’s more than 176 000 SAP customers are based in the Boomland.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase sales to 20 billion euros by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfer had redeemed around 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the business of the software provider, which employs 55 000 people worldwide, is running as well as rarely before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott explained.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China through comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Empathetic and generous, Peter Englund's new book, "Beauty and Horrors, begins. A story of the First World War, told in nineteen fates" with a long list of main characters that goes to your heart.
Here’s a tip on how to proceed: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novelistic narrative. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments where, like Englund's, you're lost to men and women in the fog of war and deprived of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which is the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book that he does not incorrectly describe as "a work of anti-history."
It contains few big names, important contracts or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, frenzied reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about how it was." It's about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods."
"Beauty and horror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war together, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some coming in, while others go out.
Englund's book differs from the usual history books.
It also corrects the idea that the First World War was only the devastating war of position on the Western Front.
"Beauty and horror" wanders with expert view over other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
On the soldiers in this book fall beehives, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, Tsetse flies are an insoluble problem.
This is a moving book from the beginning.
The war is flooding the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like a hurricane Katrina smelling like Kordit.
Imagine you're a woman who's at home with her children, and you hear cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or do you take flight?
Who's coming anyway?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged in the first place.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "have been refurbished with conjectures, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individual persons such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life reports can be terrifying or poignant, but they are extremely alive in English from the collection of small moments that lose in detail.
Many of them are about lack and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he recounts: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Replacement coffee, false aluminum, false eraser, paper dressings, wood buttons."
He tells more about the replacement dinner in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and most recently served with a false bone made of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes that were sold with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the manufacture of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge to be fierce and says of the war: "You feel that despite everything that was intended for men rather than sitting in the armchair, with the evening leaf or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whisky in hand, and pretending to be such a facade means civilization and as if there is no barbarism behind one's own strengthened and fogged shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die and no one will take notice of it or take care of it.
"When you refrain from the thought of sacrificing yourself, you want to think this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it is as terrible as "a convicted man who was hanged in secret."
Other observations are about the old Europe that falls apart, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has increasingly become an economic contest," Englund writes, "a war between factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the word-turned and ideologically convinced mass murderer in the custom-made suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in an unforeseen way and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who were actively trying to get infected with a venereal disease in a prostitute to escape the frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be discovered in the trade with gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals, hoping to get to the hospital like this," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eye, which led to them being blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund’s poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive and adapts perfectly to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the way the war "unleashed uncontrollable forces in a unique way: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are getting them to fight.
The best books about the First World War were mostly more distorted than Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels such as Erich Maria Remarque's "In the West Nothing New" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read of in a nonfiction book.
I'm not giving it up anymore.
But it's like he snatched away this page with the main characters in front of his nose with his book and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a minutely planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of whom were wearing operational helmets.
One had decided on the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at that time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and few senior officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed they were participating in an exercise.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the midst of them and his presence underlined the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of the past few weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violates the rules of the department and gave the squatters a huge increase in public sympathy, were no longer allowed to repeat themselves.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by watching occupations in other cities being handled.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randalls Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training - counter-terrorism measures, including the rapid relocation of a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training unit was held Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the orders, which spoke for a declaration as an "exercise."
"The few police officers who were involved to my knowledge did not know that it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wishes to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the high-ranking officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On 14. Officials wanted to clear the park in October, but then backed away when hundreds of protesters came together after they learned of these plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including operational squads from across the city - hundreds of mobile officers who are usually deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr Kelly said that over the course of the day, many people enter and go out of the park, almost like commuters, so 1 a.m. at night is a good time to go in.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people in the park are staying," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lamps and loudspeakers stood before the departure at the Pike Slip and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive ready near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and pre-recorded messages roaring out of the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When public officials entered the park in their light blue windbreakers, many protesters simply gathered their things together and left the place.
Police said no tents would be touched by 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack their belongings together.
Other teams of officials were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests in the park become necessary.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the police commissioner, said this had happened for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to stop them from watching the police actions in the park. And they said the officers' handling was very rough.
Mr Browne said television cars on Church Street on the west side of the park could have taken photos.
When the police moved to the west through the great confusion of personal belongings of the protesters, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags with clothes, followed her by employees of the city cleaning, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared on the Internet a short time later.
A main core of protesters moved into position near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodological arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp banded together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called in to cut them loose.
As Mr Kelly said, up to approx. 3:30 p.m. no arrests carried out in the park.
The eviction was completed after 75 minutes, according to police.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were due to "unsustained behavior and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent official on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the department's chief, the department's highest uniformed official.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of the crime scene department, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly "did not direct" the operation, as Mr Browne said.
In case they were supposed to access, a second group of officials waited on the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
Barricades were erected in Cortlandt Street, a roadblock north of the park, and in Pine Street, a block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police continued to expand the perimeter around Zuccotti Park.
In one place, several officers, many of them with protective shields, were observed driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police bus.
In one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an officer and a protester came to the hospital.
Association of carers will file suit against the city over dismissals
The union, which represents hundreds of school supervisors who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday as the layoffs are not necessary and discriminatory because of their unnecessary influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is probably the last possibility that of the union, District Council 37, is still open in its efforts to reverse the redundancies.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, care coordinators and other staff who were among the city's worst-paid employees and on the 7th. October in a move had lost their jobs, which union leaders have described as political revenge for the fact that last year the city had refused access to a health fund that the working groups maintained, with which the budget gap should be closed.
That accusation was categorically denied by the authorities.
At a City Council hearing, Dennis M. said. Walcott, director of schools, last month, said the layoffs were part of the budget that was passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back and explained to him that nothing specified in the budget that staff would be laid off from school aid.
City Council Officers 37 said they had and warned the Department of Education against a lawsuit. There will be a press conference on Wednesday at which the filing of the lawsuit will be formally announced in the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will be Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and count eight laid-off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are women of color or Latin America, like most of the aid workers who have lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Justice Department, said the city was not facing the lawsuit and thus could not comment on its individual claims.
According to a bill filed with the New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs at the schools in the city's poor districts to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. She claims poor schools have lost more aid workers as they are chronically underfunded.
She lays out that while there were no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school assistants lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 aid workers were fired in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
With the finding of the loss of five out of eight school assistants employed in public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states: "This is not a neighborhood of sheltered parents who can organize donations to catch budget cuts."
P.S. The budget of 36. Districts were cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its calculation method for extra funding for each poor school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of high schools were misled by the language in a memo that approved the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the plot, even if "excess" in the U.S. usually describes the change of a teacher from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six care coordinators have been dismissed, not transferred," the bill states.
Mission ended, Congress ready to agree on Libya
It ultimately looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already agreeing on the uprisings in Libya.
All that was needed for this was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi and the end of American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee resolves a resolution to Chairman John Kerry (Massacussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut) is under the authority to praise Libya for the successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of the support of its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House disputed the wording of a series of resolutions to endorse or disapprove of the U.S. military's role in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain tabled a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was dismissed in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and no vote came to be held.
But on the same day, that bill fell through in the Senate. The board also overruled a decision to cut funds for American operations in Libya.
As a result, the U.S. mission got into a kind of legislative purgatory - with a Congress that, while upset enough to criticize Obama's course of action as part of the mission, it was not angry enough to finally pull the ground away from under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overtaken by the events.
Tripoli fell among the Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi became on the 20. October killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on 31 September October.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The Committee on International Relations' resolution "congratulates the people of Libya to their enormous courage and their extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "praises the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support the military operations to protect the people of Libya, for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in a successful and irrevocable transition from Libya to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the Panel on Foreign Relations or will they divide lawmakers, as the June law did?
The final version encounters the opposition of Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the committee's top Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he has not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to Capitol, it's up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional legislature of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional change to the budget or any other area that is currently coming to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far unsuccessfully tried to put their changes to the vote, even though they have tried it often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional changes submitted to this Congress that cover a whole range of issues.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to both Congress and the Senate - others only slightly deviate from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the compensation budget change in the Senate alone and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their clients - especially beginners to the Republicans who want to polish up their resume - the possibility of bragging that they have "written" such a measure.
The budget control bill, passed in August, requires both Senate and Congress to vote on a change in budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution that supports the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can present, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to lift the limit on two terms of the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a number of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
A change that prohibits marriage among same-sex people, as well as a change that prohibits the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of states reject them.
As eager as the members suggest changes, they are moving as much faster as in previous years.
In 111. Congress submitted lawmakers 77 of such changes. in the 110. Congress 66.
The pace is fading compared to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to the figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination
Ten months after an armed man shot at her from a distance during an election event in Tucson, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than the one to return to Congress.
When she appeared along with Diane Sawyer in the ABC messages "20/20," she wrestled for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage the bullet, which divided her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back, has done.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January assassination attempt, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughing and singing - describing her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford (41) replied: "Quite good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special recorded shortly before the release of the couple's new book: "Gabby: A Story about courage and hope."
The special has been following Gifford's recovery since the assassination of 8. January.
In videos Kelly had recorded in the first few weeks, she is seen in the hospital bed, with a bald shaved head and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift a finger or two if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair, while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod with your head.
A twitch with the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast to be changed.
Videos played in the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: one sees the congresswoman singing along with the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and to Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'."
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours of therapy a day, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he was Giffords on 12. March read an article by a daily newspaper about the assassination when she interrupted it and asked for the first time about the six people who had been killed during the assassination.
Alleged gunman Jared Lee Loughner is in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly treated while awaiting his trial.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords Sawyer recounted.
"Tough, hard, hard."
In the course of his wife's recovery, Kelly told Sawyer, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I'd say, "Gabby, you didn't get defeated?"" Kelly said.
You were just hit.
And you're going to get through this and you're going to recover and you'll come back stronger than ever before.
Troops are more likely to feel compassion than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On a keyword, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedoes stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers and female soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraising campaign in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, watched by the chief of staff and then-chairman, Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know this.
But it was no respect, really not. It was pity.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their victims.
But the praise has its price, service members say.
The public is increasingly acting as if the people in uniform were suffering.
"We were by no means victims," Brigade General Sean B said. MacFarland, which commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But seemingly the only way of support is to press us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or in dispute with the public they serve.
They have also realized that the anger that returning troops were fighting in the last years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion in silence and private between war veterans take place.
After his two sons returned from battles with the Marines, the Colonel warned a.D. Mark Cancian before that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, as they had defeated rebels and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran is hiding below the surface," said Cancian, who had fought in Iraq and took over an upscale state post in Washington after his return.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some of the respondents subtly asked if he was able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington right after his return from battle.
"When you talk about your service, you have to hold the negative impressions against it," Cancian explained to his sons.
The lack of ease of the military is partly rooted in the Americans' lack of interest in the war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely singled out as praise by a country that has little experience with the military and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer appreciate military heroism as was absolutely customary in World War II," said Lieutenant General David Barno a.D., who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public largely focuses on the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are getting credit for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or for the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on harsh crackdown on rape
This week, a major hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with non-intervention in a rape in the military court.
Should it not come to this, hundreds of plaintiffs are ready for the next hearing.
Higher-free Elizabeth Lyman was 25 and in the 11th. Week pregnant when she was raped at night by a fellow soldier.
It was in October 2008 and she was just returning to her barracks in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she encountered a male colleague carrying a 12pc pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went on," Lyman said.
But the Texan wiped her concerns aside.
I was like, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after she went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushing her down and raping her, she claims.
This week, on the 18th. November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, in which it is decided whether a lawsuit they filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be admitted in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not crack down on widespread rape within the military and in violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially included 17 plaintiffs, but they rose to 28 in the following months: 25 women and three men, all claiming that they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict or provide appropriate jurisdiction after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's pursuing the top military leadership as the problem begins there.
"The military is hierarchically constructed," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in the position of repaying the culture of eradicating? The leadership.”
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in a basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to maintain the pressure.
The Defense Department's team, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss lawsuit.
The court's files, which are available to Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or previous soldiers for injuries that have occurred in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law, the so-called Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for any injuries inflicted on active-duty soldiers.
"The alleged damage was caused during the military service of the plaintiffs," the document states.
The Department of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not admitted to service in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in contact with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat operations.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her fight: three other complaints besides hers are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Independently of this, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is acknowledging a lawsuit against the military, which focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received to release them from service - a common course of action, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed suit in December against the Veterans Administration, in which she accused her of discriminatory practices in her handling of benefit claims for individuals who claimed to have been sexually abused on duty.
Nine laws were independently submitted to Congress by a mix of senators and representatives of both parties, which provide a number of clues.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuses were reported, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But most abuses are not reported at all and according to the Pentagon’s own estimate, this figure takes into account approx. 13.5% of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur per year.
The report, released in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases in the military came to court, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape of the military police less than an hour after the raid.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a whole host of police, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape set and the blood of her attacker, which came from a cut to his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During that hearing, she was asked about the sex she had before assault with her boyfriend.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I still remember the day when the verdict was read out," Lyman says.
"I thought the contractions would start. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out again, I said to my commander, 'That was not his procedure.' That was my procedure.”
Lyman was told to see a military psychiatrist who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her incapacitated.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, so she does not receive any support whatsoever.
Whether the lawsuit that Lyman and the other plaintiffs have filed is progressing is pure speculation, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes, "In my view, they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I'm a critic of the Feres doctrine throughout my life.
The military is lagging a decade behind, because they do not have the same incentive and the same deterrent that liability entails.
He adds: "The odds are against them... but it's important for them to try."
These things will only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its path, Burke, the plaintiff's lawyer, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whatever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers are watching you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who broadcast their anti-immigration opinion online.
On Monday, Breivik, who confessed to having committed in a July rampage in Norway that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he has spent a lot of time until his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social networks.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
This is easy - you only have to log in to Facebook.
"We found it wasn't hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British ideas factory DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding place of personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply need to use the page's advertising tool to accurately set their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their level of education, attitudes toward violence and the assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even having to leave their office once.
"It's a fairly new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online sponsors of far-right groups are mostly young, male and angry about immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twisting, "those who combine their online activism with an offline activism are more sensible, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMO’s work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Idea factories, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends like in "Likes," text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding on average three content per day, Facebook's "Datasupernova" is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with the name of this page in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that you can study through this page people you don’t usually reach with your clipboard on the street.
"If you used to try to question people of the British National Party, it was very hard to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first and that would never have granted them access," says Bartlett.
"On Facebook, all this falls away - you go straight to them."
Others say the site provides a way to recognize and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues has found that students who discussed their full-throated on Facebook are significantly more prone to problem drinking than students who were silent on this topic.
Moreno suggests that peer students, for example, residential counselors, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you didn't recognize it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and head of Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle told The Washington Post.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The site's data team has compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Lucky Index (which primarily used information that only Facebook has access to - masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its large data treasure trove accessible to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they want to or not. In order to be able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to dispose of your own personal data.
But what if Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how to collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, says of a 2006 study in which he examined the public pages of students on Facebook.
"As far as she is concerned, it was all about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information is true in a user profile and in posts.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools that anyone can use.
"There is no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social - and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
'Cold and inhumane': Anders Behring Breivik appears before a public court for the first time
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two rampages that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance in a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knight Templar of Norway," he said outside a courtroom with more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you have received your mandate from organizations that support hassideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I do not plead guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue, as he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform where he can express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to contact the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered that police keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, he has four weeks of no access to the media. He said authorities will closely control all visits and all correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in the hope of being able to look Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he remained behind the lock and bolt.
Everyone participated with the goal that everything boils down to a way.
"I thought he seemed cold and inhumane," a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after I see and hear the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and a blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered the building and left again.
Despite Breivik's bizarre hint that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not insane and said there was no evidence that he had had accomplices.
It may please some that the attacks of 22. July apparently was the work of a single extremist and not that of a group of radicals.
But does that automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still senses?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the relative of a victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the late Steve Jobs, which was shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on the 5th. In October, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technology genius as a great modern inventor.
What Apple fans may find most revealing in the recently rediscovered job interview, which was dusted off this week before special film screenings in the important markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer and self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer eagerly tinkering with diagrams - a man who believed that many executives suffer from "a disease of thinking," "that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of the Professional Idiots" about the departure of the personal computer. And he sat with jobs for more than an hour, in which they had one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
By that time, it had been 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple. And he was already working hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was looking forward to the broad adoption of the internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in specialist idiots, he says the copy templates of the interview were missing from the delivery.
Only after Job's death did a full VHS copy be discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview," which comes to the Landmark Theatre this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for loathing extensive interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four times longer breaks between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he reacts seemingly impatiently to Cringely's questions and pushes him to address issues or side actions of greater importance more quickly.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview somehow seems eerily farsighted when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right or wrong in their opinion and represents their own vision of the computer's future.
It's one thing to read posthumous tributes of career Jobs'. But seeing jobs here as the eager dreamer who is on the jump to the greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went off and made it.
A quick look at seven notable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"During all the years in the business, I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's how it's made."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks about things in detail.
That's what I've found.
Jobs continues to carry out its efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Amazed by how costs were recorded - most of the time "standard costs" started, which were estimated to be mere guessed and which were then adjusted with "deviation" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that the business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was fooled:
Jobs tells of the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
A lot has already been written about the device, but Jobs enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a paid phone, making a call and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent stuff half a dozen times around the globe and when you roared into the phone, it came out again a minute later in the phone next door," Jobs tells kichernd.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that can control trillions of dollars in infrastructure around the world."
We both, we didn't know much, but we could build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think there would be Apple without it.
Jobs continues to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican via Blue Box in the middle of the night and wanted to talk to the Pope while they could so well imitate Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the pope himself came to the phone.
How he fell in love with the technique (and unpreparedly called Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after her 20-minute phone call, Jobs received a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
“That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I'd seen at that age and it shaped my views on what a company was and how well it handled its employees.'
Later, Jobs became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
He was as big as a suitcase, had a small screen with a brown tube and I fell in love with him.
I would climb up at HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he installed some circuit boards, he was asked by a client to assemble the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... They shouted at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer.'
Ninety days later we had a mouse that we could build for $15. That was incredibly credible.
About large companies that are slacking off:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the paths in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They own the share monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [is it those people] who ultimately run the companies and the product that people use to be pushed out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is eradicated by the people who have no concept regarding good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
That happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if it could have been Microsoft of the 1990s...
They have caught defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about your subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Ultimately, it boils down to the taste, it boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff people have created and then trying to bring these things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who work there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it hadn't been the computer industry, they would be creating fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health laws, as court accepts case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically sharing question of whether one will hear a challenge to President Obama's health laws, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the firm that the case will be represented in court.
The incident took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became a buzzword among conservative activists all over the U.S.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, which is believed to be boosting its outcome, presumably, will boost the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing at the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial and claim that the law is to be overturned will presumably be Paul Clement, once attorney general under the George W government. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the nearly two dozen companies that supported the federalist society's annual dinner, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which contest the law.
Another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially hugely involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place a few hours after the court discussed the case at a Washington hotel.
Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader of the Republicans and a declared opponent of health care reform, among others, had service
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And that doesn't violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are freed from the code of conduct governing the actions of the lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under principle 4c of the code, which states: "A judge can participate in charity events law closer and other organizations, whereby the judge must not be a speaker, guest of honour or, according to the program, a guest of such events."
Nevertheless, the extreme proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms related to the case, as well as to a company with a massive financial interest in it, were enough to alarm morale and government activists.
"This startling break with morality and the contrast to the code punishes the lawsuits of some judges' lie, the court adheres to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the U.S.
"The judges won and dined during a benefit event with lawyers with pending proceedings at the court."
Their appearance and support for a fundraising event for this event undermine any claim to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little consideration for critics who say they mix court matter too easily with groups that are guided by the agenda, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
By contrast, the Conservatives claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a prosecutor general under the Obama administration when the first law challenges came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case for bias, as she was too engaged in the defense of the law to be unbiased.
Kagan doesn't make any attempt to do that.
Boeing pulls record order of 18 trillion dollars ashore
Emirates airline orders 50 two-course Boeing 777 aircraft with an option on 20 more aircraft.
In addition, Boeing is selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a store worth more than 1 trillion dollars.
It is really a rare message that a company is getting an order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it's big business if the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 aircraft is at a record sum of 18 trillion dollars overall.
Equally unusual is Boeing's principal: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines from the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth 450 trillion dollars in the coming 20 years.
Boeing announced its biggest order ever for commercial aircraft over the weekend, as measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has, Boeing announced it at the Dubai Aviation Show in 2011, an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will increase the total list price to 26 trillion dollars.
On Monday, according to Boeing Oman Air, six Boeing 787-8, the so-called Dreamliner, ordered the enormous improvement in gasoline consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than 1 trillion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar's stock market expert.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle East airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the planes. Rather, an increase in oil prices, which usually harms airlines, as this is one of their biggest cost points, is not as damaging as the country earns on a higher oil price.
That's important as they tend to cancel or postpone aircraft orders less than other airlines when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
Emirates' order reaffirms Boeing's leadership position in the wholesale aircraft market and helps keep Airbus competitor SAS at bay, which attacks supremacy with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the aviation show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
One postponed the introduction to gain more trust after customers demanded a higher payload and reach.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister apparently losing election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims drug trafficker opponents have supported Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for the governorship post.
President Felipe Calderon's sister has apparently lost her application for the office of governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favour of one of their opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, won the race for the governorship post in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the election process, and especially yesterday, is alarming, not just for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... They've occupied voting booths, set up road blockades ... and hired people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled in Mexico for seven decades until it lost its presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in those efforts.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the July presidential election.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had yet to lead in the polls ahead of Election Day.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party PRD, the currently incumbent governor, came in third place, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left-wing leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been ruled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is President Calderon's homeland and he has chosen Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates have dropped out of local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how disgusting the elections in Michoacan appear.
The man who will presumably represent the PRI in the race for presidential office is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said: "I think this victory will make us look boldly into next year."
ADB urges Asia to provide aid to eurozone rescue
Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to support the eurozone's rescue in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will curb the growth of Asia's economy.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the ADB, based in Manila, said the world's two fastest-growing economic nations must do "everything in your power" to accelerate the recovery of the currency bloc either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct mutual agreements.
He warned of the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) that are "sufferingly" looking at the difficulties in Europe, and said that financial support from European leadership and European resources through Asia helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
“We’re all in the same boat.”
"So anyone helpful who can help Europe out of this crisis," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's not immune."
"So if China and India can help, it's by all means."
Europe's monetary union has been in a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe's emerging severe debt crisis is fuelling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and led to shouts that the leading emerging economies would have to team up to support the eurozone.
Mr Nag predicted that any support of Asia will be channelled by the IMF, but said that mutual agreements - such as the purchase of bonds of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stabilisation Facility (EFSF) - would offer greater bargaining power to European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone, as its own economy is now suffering from falling exports and drying up foreign capital flow.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to continue to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We face major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a mission, because where else do we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help the rich Europeans if they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at the US Brown University, said that politically it would be very hard to sell aid to the 1.2 trillion people in India for Europe, of which more than 800 million of 2 dollars or even less a day live in.
"At some point, they will find out that the Greeks are retiring at 50 and spending holidays on the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to retain the numerous and well-paid public service employees in Greece, with jobs in poorly managed, losses-inducing facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the crises in the eurozone will have "significant domino effects" on the whole of Asia.
The ADB's forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for the years 2011/is now threatening "the risk of gradation" due to the looming danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets would have to create "crisis plans" to protect themselves for a downward trend and a significant capital churn of their words.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would weaken national security unnoticed. In doing so, he triggered a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon's halls to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already thinking through cuts of 450 trillion dollars over the course of the coming decade, but now fears that further cuts by 600 trillion dollars or more will become necessary if Congress cannot make a deal in spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the Department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a congressional failure in achieving a budget agreement, which will lead to so-called seizure, would result in 23% general cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a high cut, carried out in such a careless manner, would make most of our ship and construction projects unworkable - you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily separate ourselves from much of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would certainly have to take a leave of absence from civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who sustain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts were ultimately hitting the combat troops," Panetta said.
"While the wartime quotas in the anti-terrorist struggle are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious intervention in the basic budget would adversely affect war efforts," Panetta warned.
"Personnel settings have been cut, which would lead to delays in the hiring and hiring supervision that support the war."
"The salaries of the staff would be cut, which will lead to late payments to wartime traders and the legal as well as political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago and asked for more details regarding the potential influence of the automatic cuts on the Defense Department.
"The consequences of a seizure by the Department of Defense would initiate a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon as they released Panetta's letter.
"This is a result we can't live with, and it's certainly not one to impose on us."
"The seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and their occurrence should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta's letter and the senators' new warnings will increase pressure on a compromise in the budget or intensify demands to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has increasingly bluntly pronounced the possible cuts, even though he has been able to gain many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before he came to the top of the Pentagon, and knows he faces heavy decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense minister painted a bleak picture of what might be imminent - a military with a shell, but without a core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of completing the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morality and alert and that is unable to take on potential opponents."
"She's actually making you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta cited new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, serious restrictions on our worldwide operational and intervention capability, leading to unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the cancellation, including those who have already been tested and are already in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation of ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that Army and Marine need to replace the Humvee.
Would one stop the further development and testing of the F35 would save this up to 80 trillion dollars in the next 10 years, but proponents say it is an important next step to rearmament, so possible dangers can be spelled out by China and other opponents.
How to Unmask a Lie
A look at the current headlines shows how questionable and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trying to deal with the allegations of sexual harassment on the part of several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State's leadership is accused of perjury, as one has allegedly withheld reports that a retired football coach sexually assaulted boys.
Last week, an open microphone was heard when French President Nikolas Sarkozy told American President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were very quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of the violations in campaign finance, which is related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton sparked when he lied during his second term in the Oval Office regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Stories about cheating at school and at college exams are widely available.
There were incidents in which teachers gave their students the exam answers so that they were good even in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lies and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times every day.
Many of these lies are considered to be no need lies.
Another study shows strangers lying to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "Uncovering lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a social game such as charades, in which the goal is to shout "Have you!", unmasking a deception is a serious field of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that conducted far-reaching research projects, especially in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been unmasked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stammer, blush and fidget.
From this, however, it must not be concluded that these liars are difficult to detect and expose.
A practiced unsailer of lies can penetrate to the truth by learning about the structure of the assertion, the subtle facial expressions, about questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific results of the comprehensive and ever-growing area of unmasking. And it is clear that unmasking a deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us to navigate our complex world, especially if hiring or questioning people or negotiations or administration are among our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and mastering their own emotions. And they intuitively feel how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverted people are more likely to lie than introverts that men are more likely to show up "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - usually they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people lie to their partners less frequently than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that if one person has been exposed as a culprit, others feel less guilty of lying to that person.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, by observing the normal behavior of this person.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the attitude, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
You should know better when someone usually trips with their foot all the time, so they don't wrongly blame him when he's going to trip with his foot during a meeting.
Then watch for accumulations of striking verbal and non-verbal behaviors.
Consider these accumulations as alarm bells that shrill, not as evidence of unmasking.
People who are fooling may freeze when they try to remember their story. Perhaps their feet point towards the door or they lean towards the exit, change their position in a significant way or show a "relaxation after the hiring conversation," this deep, relaxing exhalation and the change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often falsely signal that a hiring interview is over, only to look for this relaxation after the hiring interview.
Also, pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slip-up is famous when he used the past form when he claimed his slain wife was still alive and sparked a national search for her.
Deceptives can also use a distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or when you repeat a tricky question in the whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when they answer a tricky question: "Now... to tell you the truth ... as far as I know ... to the best of my knowledge and belief."
This makes the answer more perceptive than objective, which often makes the alarm bells ring.
There is no magic tool for unmasking lies, but you can learn skills that allow unmasking.
Thanks to these skills, anyone can become a casualty of fraudsters less often, both in both private and professional life.
Controversial plan of an oil pipeline is being revised after endangering delayed U.S. approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which angered the unions while reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is scrambling to re-plan the project so that you can get back to normal.
TransCanada said on Monday evening that the planned pipeline will be diverted from the ecologically sensitive area of the Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska parliament building.
Alex Pourbax of TransCanada said the company remains confident that the pipeline will ultimately be approved, albeit with a different course.
This was according to an announcement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs last week, after which a decision regarding a federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course was reviewed, which avoided the area of the Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a large underwater supply.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review, which the State Department has ordered, may adjourn a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, even if officials deny politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama stated in a written statement last week that the decision was a State Department task and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline was connected to Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
She would pump 700,000 barrels of oil a day from Alberta province to the Texas refineries.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them, because they estimate the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
Yet Nebraska's lawmakers, who oppose the plan, are weighing the laws to force a departure from the region of the Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The current study on influence on the environment of the State Department has found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the source of the energy industry states that the ministry's principal auditor has requested a separate probe of the review process that focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, is in a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company that was commissioned to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice since it is related to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged as she allegedly forced a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle would have been given a raging attack in the lobby of her Manhattan building, which would have so scared her little daughter that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she was suffering from "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family said outside the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
It was on the 10. November last year, when stage worker Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were about to embark on a family outing.
While Kevin Monk picked up the car, Roseanna Monk walked with her luggage and Genevieve on his arm into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped off her daughter for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, "Do you know what your daughter is doing right now?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle admonished the pregnant woman angrily.
"She said in an aggressive tone: "You should not put your daughter off near the door," Roseanna told Monk.
"I told her, "I don't care what you say or think.""
She got angry and started scolding - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and started tipping water from the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, "See what you did to my daughter,"" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve on her arm, and had to be held back by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby screamed so much that it had to vomit, she said.
Later, the LaBelle family asked for an apology in writing, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representative did not respond to calls asking for comment.
The lawsuit is on an unspecified compensation, but the family's lawyer, Sam Davis, said he was not charging a fee and the family was planning to donate the money they would give to the child cancer charity.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for their behavior," Davis said.
"This type of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when it is displayed to a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old baby on her arm."
Climatic adversity put the brakes on the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
In 2011, Sinaloa will be remembered in the economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and raised high hopes regarding economic growth, is at the government. However, as a result of the climate adversity, growth cannot be mentioned, but on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the millions in agriculture, but also set tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter. This is mainly due to the historic reduction of agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a slowing effect on other economic sectors.
According to a Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (ed. Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) report on the effects of the frost was damaged in 582 000 hectares of agricultural land, of which 78.03 percent was completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed. Especially the vegetable, corn and chickpea cultivation were affected.
The decline in economic activity until November has caused unemployment in the Mexican state to rise steadily. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid rise in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloa had no employment, which corresponds to 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74 000 unemployed people in Sinaloa. That's 18 969 more people than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa in that year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the politics of public institutions indirectly declares the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is a rise in unemployment, which has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of the cuts in funds by the legislation passed to combat money laundering in Congress, because for those who illegally accumulate dollars, it is not easy to let them work for themselves, to invest them or to use them for anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that growing unemployment is also a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, particularly in the United States, has declined. This is due on the one hand to the entry problems and on the other hand, because it is also difficult to find work there. These people stay here and look for work here, which raises unemployment," he says.
Black work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when taking into account the high proportion of undeclared work. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 percent of the employees in the country who work without paying into the social insurance funds.
Low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to the statistics of the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Authority for Labour and Social Care in Mexico), come to unemployment and undeclared work.
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos by September; this is much less than the general government average, which stands at 7375 pesos.
Decline of ADI
In addition to the reduction of economic activity and growing unemployment, the largest decline in foreign direct investment (ADI) in the last ten years is recorded in 2011. According to Secretaría de Economía (state economic authority), the ADI was 630 597 dollars from January to June, which corresponds to a decline of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 143 312 dollars in the same period in the previous year.
For its part, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Authority for Economic Development) has a total investment of 17 280 000 pesos in 2011, which is mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3 000 000 000 pesos, which should be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The National Congress approved an amount of 200 600 000 pesos, but no positive impact of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be identified by November.
Reactions
For the representatives of entrepreneurship, the first year of government made Mario López Valdé's incapacity for government evident.
Miguel Loredo López, Chairman of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico) represented that in 2011 no effort was made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the state government.
"The economic activity in Sinaloa this year was really very poor. It has to be hard work to regain the terrain lost this year and in 2012 we have to put in a double effort. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-attended government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López expressed that events, such as the frost at the beginning of the year, made the country's economic development difficult and slowed.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowed economy that is not sufficiently moving to evoke an economic dynamic that could generate a decent flow of processes, products and services. That's why we're going to close the year well below our expectations," he said.
Redefining appeal
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, chairman of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana (Entrepreneurs Association of Mexico) in Sinaloa, said that the state had to be persuaded to do more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we observed that work was done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redetermine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There's a lot of work to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that puts the government's efforts in better shape.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he explained.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress on the government.
"There are areas in which one can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A resident of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 daily sentences for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's public prosecutor's office announced that the drug trafficker was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was punished for a public health offence - here the possession of marijuana intended for trafficking.
According to the file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was born on 7. Junio 2010 by Mexican military in monitoring of the street Cipriano Valdez opposite the guard post No. 80 arrested in the village of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug trafficker drove in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and in the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the judge of the district and the punisher is still in the prison.
Debt for construction work
The social buildings for migrants planned in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes are at risk of not being completed due to a lack of funds or only with great delay, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The head of the municipal authority for social development explained that although the construction programs have already progressed, they are now in danger, since the state government has not paid the funds it is entitled to, which exceed 11 million peso for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs amounted to nearly 50 million peso, of which 25 percent fell to the state. Until now, only the Federación and the municipality had contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the construction termination is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and even though the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they should have paid us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be too late, we have already started construction work, and they are already well advanced, but we need the money."
He emphasized that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of its reign. That would correspond to the amount that the central government should have raised.
"This had already happened to us in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to get the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the state authorities were obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance , requested to speed up administrative work and to pay out the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is already coming to an end, they haven't given us a penny."
The court approves the transition to digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of analogue to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional actions filed by the Senate and the House of Representatives against the presidential decree, and by virtue of which the switchover from analogue to digital signals must be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to a lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, were of the opinion that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his competences when he issued the legislative decree with the details of the switchover to terrestrial digital television.
This decision rejected the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate, as it did not receive the required qualified majority of eight votes so that the court could decide on the constitutionality or non-constitutionality. So the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, which was drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the legislative decree unconstitutional, since the regulations concerning radio and television are the responsibility of the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico), which is why the Legislative Decree would be contrary to the hierarchical principles and the law
In favor of the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero themselves voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies filed constitutional complaints against the Legislative Decree. After the actions were taken, Minister Sánchez Cordero no longer applied the Legislative Decree and ceased all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering the debate on the project, which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible for.
In his contribution, the Prime Minister expressed that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government must not regulate with general regulations the measures that the public administration should take.
"I also don't think that if you did that, the independence of the regulatory body would be compromised." It also recalled that for constitutional reasons, the central government is responsible for planning strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, because it is in charge of state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals with digital is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it brings about better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The postponement of the changeover, she said, was a postponement of the benefit of digitization, which was a decision in the public interest, which not only had technical aspects, "because it encompasses economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "necessarily made the action of the entire system necessary, according to the principle of economic governance by the state, they included a group of features that put the constitution in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries worldwide had already carried out the digital transition, even though they had highly specialized facilities.
It could not be concluded that the government would intervene in the competences of Congress with the release of the contested legislative decree, because the laws passed by the legislature would be complied with," she assured.
The possibility of counting the ballots in Michoacán individually is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes totaling 6074 not yet counted.
The possibility of the individual counting of the ballots is a reality in the elections in Michoacán this year, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is almost 27 percent, with 879 votes of a total of 6074 not yet counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, has reminded that just on the past 9. November the electoral office had adopted a number of regulations on the harmonization of local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be remembered that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law, nor his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they had not come into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided her publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines provided for this, with the argument of still having objections to it.
On the 9. In November, the Supreme Court of Mexico (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional action filed by the local legislature and judged the voice of the state commissioner on the constitutional reforms to be "invalid and unlawful" because he did not have the right to "decide on it or to veto it."
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of the individual counting of the votes that, thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, there would now be the possibility that the local election authority could partially or completely count the ballot papers.
Thus, under the following conditions, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may not be partially counted The results in the minutes do not match; the record of the counting and calculation of votes is not available in terms of file or it is not in the possession of the chairman of the election committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the total counting of the fully completed voting slips can be made if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the one in second place, which is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is an explicit request from the party or. Coalition chairwoman, who is the second of the candidates mentioned.
The counting of votes can also be carried out in their entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is established that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate has become second. In this case, the election packages that have been suspended from a partial count would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where according to PREP the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 election protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down this Sunday night on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the show of the dead and a funeral mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last will was that his ashes would be scattered across the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After an honor, the family of Bacio Cortés, along with the others, returned to the capital of Coahuila in the accident on a Mexican Air Force plane. The closest persons to the colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve noon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes landed on the funeral hall, which is on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, and where the family members and friends came to.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Saltillo Technological Institute. This morgue was prompted by his former classmates from the technical high school diploma and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for high school.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and that his ashes would be scattered over the Zapalinamé Mountains. He had always said so to his family and friends," Sandra Bacio Cortés, sister of the pilot, announced.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she is of the opinion that he had stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, extraordinary as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought it was even dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strived to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo, and already the whole family wanted to welcome him, as if on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he had driven to Zapopán to graduate his family member. That's why he knows his uncle died when he did what he liked best: flying a plane.
One last goodbye
Mexican Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Felipe Bacio Cortés was passed with all honors under the direction of Governor Jorge Torres López. The people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, the headmaster and students of the technological educational institution of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out as excellent in both studies and sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flown, in which the secretary of state, José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same authority, also sat, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizens of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez, on the forecourt of the barracks by the funeral home. There, his family members, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, pupils and teachers, were already waiting for him.
The abandoned body was found on a property at the Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the find, military personnel introduced eleven people arrested in the same town in connection with organized crime to the media.
Three men were found by gunfire in different body parts and a mercy shot murdered in an abandoned finca in the town of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.

When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters further inside, which they immediately told the relevant authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him was another dressed in a white top.
Just a metre away, another person's body was lying with red T-shirt and blue trousers.
All three were on their stomachs.
According to the information obtained on site, the three people must have been murdered in another location because no bullet casings were found.
On the wall of the country house, inscriptions can be read, which an organized crime gang writes to another, in addition, several bullets were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (State Secretariat for National Defense) introduced 11 people, including a minor who were part of a crime that was mainly in the town of Cadereyta, and who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (human hunt) and secret funerals.

On Wednesday, formation of the new Italian government
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which is to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of the economic collapse.
The Prime Minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet with the President of Italy tomorrow to introduce him to the new government, which is to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of the economic collapse.
A message from the presidential palace announced that Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, would meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm the formation of the government.
It is expected that he will present a cabinet composed of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of the talks with the political parties on the formation of the government.
"I want to reaffirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU commissioner told the journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments show that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "frame is well staked out now," he added.
Monti has managed to form a government in less than three days, which is far less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is battling a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of the debt to an unbearable amount.
The new government, led by former EU commissioner Monti, must pass a tough austerity package called for by euro politicians to regain ailing confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry, which weighs on Monti, was further intensified by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were burdened with 7 percent interest for 10 years. This corresponds to the state of Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European bailout.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian industry association Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the best of our ability."
We believe this government is the last chance for Italy to come out of this emergency situation.
The chances of success of Monti were considerably magnified by the support of the party PDL of Silvio Berlusconi, who had to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe Professor Monti's efforts are destined to bring about good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a government consisting of technocrats, which Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
The new government of Monti needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or delaying the reforms could once again bring about a devastating attack by the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure with its indication that a failure of Monti is a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business associations, as well as youth and women's organisations.
Tuesday night, the session round is scheduled to be completed.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has set in motion an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a short sigh of relief towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, the cost of Italian government bonds has again reached critical limits as a result of uncertainty about the new prime minister's success.
A rescue of Italy with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue umbrella.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, which are expected to be held in 2013, despite predicting that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms, rather than preferring the elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that this should consist only of technicians, a reference to their concerns in light of the procedure imposed by the pressure of the financial markets.
Political sources point out that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties make the inclusion of people from political life complicated.
Spaniards have more play opportunities than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten have over 50 international matches on the hump.
From the side of Costa Rica, only one of the 22 conscripts has 50 games behind them.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries, set up for the friendly match, which takes place today at 15.05 in the National Stadium of San José, are compared.
While the world and European champions, the number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of class A selection games, the three-tone team only has the defensive player Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached that number last Friday with the match against Panama (0-2) at the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players who play in the League de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England have the opportunity to participate in numerous home games (League and Cup championships) as well as high-ranking European Cups such as the Champions League every year.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish Furie in complicated elimination games at the Eurocup and the World Cups.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international encounters in the context of the Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see the Spanish team pull out their last stop: the goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who reached a tie with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against the three-tone team today and Spain a new record of 127 international matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian team that had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the centre-forward of Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
The number of hundreds is also approaching Carles Puyol with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana, left-back Júnior Díaz with 48 games and striker Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came on over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The one with the fewest games.
Fewer than 30 matches are played by Spanish team Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the side of the national team come to less than 30 games Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest isn't even approaching the 20s limit.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar records only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet had their debut.
Spain's historic goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its 20th anniversary
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is coming to fruition"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They were expected to spend more than 20 years, but the band assures that a dream comes true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
That's what the group's bassist and co-founder, Jeff Ament, assured Viva of an exclusive interview last week from Brazil.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their 20th anniversary and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day, they will perform at the National Stadium from 19:30 together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You can read an excerpt from the conversation, the complete transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, a dream comes true when Pearl Jam is set in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what this means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also a reality for us.
This is just the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I was only on holiday in Costa Rica once. It's such a beautiful country that we'll definitely stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to get our music there.
I'm asking you this because the band's fans are completely devoted. You will experience the days before the concert intensely.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry to have taken so long to get here.
Some people even think your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put some pressure out of your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've put on over the last 21 years have taken place in the last two weeks.
We've played on a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and we're hoping they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like to surf and are thrilled by the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves for surfing?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, about people who love surfing, we learned about it.
With a look at the tour you have offered huge shows with many songs.
What plans do you have for the Costa Rica event?
Since we have never played there, we have no limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from every album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why? Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision we will play is not easy.
If we record two or three songs that we have not played for a long time, we can better maintain our concentration and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think so for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty years of history.
If you look back, do you find it difficult to believe in your success?
Yeah, totally.
First of all, I think that none of us imagined to play in a great rock band, and for more than 20 years. It looks like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and think it’s great to be able to make music together now.
We like each other and are excited to bring out music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places of the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things could not stand better.
What did it mean for you to have actively participated in the birth of the grunge?
It has always been an honor to belong to this group of bands.
We're good friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and abundantly unusual when a movement emerges from a group of friends.
Every once in a while, a band emerges from a city, but it's already unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud of it and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on her tour. We're excited to still be friends with all of them and it honors us to be part of that emerging Seattle sound.
It is also very unusual that a band like yours has stayed with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I think we are all lucky to still be alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't do better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you could always do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find a balance.
We make sure not to be on tour too often, because it is too easy to fall into this game with huge crowds that love your music.
As long as you think people have come because of the music, that reminds you that you have to pay attention to the music and what it has launched without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. We never cared anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and in the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We're still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think of what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It has always been a joy to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why the band chosen for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band best. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. I'm sure it'll be exciting.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings him, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to his mind.
Who were you influenced by as a bass player?
Of so many+
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk about the bass players I like all afternoon.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge alive, even though it is no longer a fad?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, I can think of the bands I mentioned before, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else who came up at the same time. If they are still important today, I think that’s great, because it’s worth listening to this music and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever before.
Initially, her music was darker, now she's more positive.
Why? Why?
That's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit light. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
To both of them, tears came to me when I heard Ed play them. They're very dark songs.
I believe that as you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - that affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also think that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came to the hospital again for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to investigate the muscle loss of his legs, his GP informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for violating human rights during his reign (1990-2000), has several conditions, including tongue cancer, which operates four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal physician, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Peruvian hospital Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower body limbs.
Aguinaga commented that, in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned for humanitarian reasons. Nevertheless, he did not wish this because he considered him innocent.
He has had four times to undergo tongue cancer and he has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and blood circulation problems in the legs, the doctor enumerated.
Fujimori has been at the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía detention centre since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the death squad of the Peruvian army, which secretly worked during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official secondment, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and entrepreneurs, will launch their visit from Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues of the region
Mujica meets with his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. That will be the culmination of his fully booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the Uruguayan president.
The discussion of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support regarding the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude those countries that still act as tax havens from the international community. That statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to his ambassador to the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20 since November, a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialized countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information to avoid double assessment with the South American country.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has tried to speed up the concretization of tax information exchange agreements in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This is what countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustache-like installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for the rescue of Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser for 25 years, but never in three dimensions until now: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which comes to the counters of all over the world this month, has been tailored from the beginning to the characteristics of the Nintende 3DS wearable console, with which it is possible to play three-dimensionally without special glasses.
"Mario is the figure who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," assured Omar Álvarez, the person in charge of the press specializing in Nintendo in Spain at the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" was "the first video game from Nintendo that was developed for this console from the beginning" , because until now, successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of 3D" have been adjustments of already existing titles.
Nintendo's spokesman underlined that although it's three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for a fast, fluid game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contained two games in one: the first part is "light" to capture the less-seized users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the different levels of games that are becoming increasingly difficult.
Also, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, to overcome the obstacles without becoming a victim of the "optical effects" must always be played three-dimensionally.
This trip Super Marios to the three-dimensional world also means the figure's return to a portable console, which has not been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The mustache-bearded installer has to overcome platforms peppered with dangers in order to free the Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom vouches for Portillo's extradition to the United States
Guatemala's president, Álvaro Colom, announced this Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to be responsible for the conspiracy to launder money of US$70 million in the United States.
Thus, the trial of the request of the USA for the extradition of Portillo ends, so that he can be brought to justice there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of judicial power and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that he had not interfered in court decisions during his administration and had granted all the extradition requests he was informed of.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's actions are a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies are exhausted to condemn the former president of state (2000 -2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited if his legal situation in Guatemala is clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzling 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defence during his reign. This negotiation preceded the extradition, but the minister objected and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organization was created to avoid the marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social welfare organisation have led to important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion were supported in order to find a way out of their difficult situation.
In addition, there are over a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, in which over 300 people took part, was taken stock yesterday.
Trinijove was launched in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with low levels of training, no work, with drug problems that were threatened by the risk of marginality.
The celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous officials from institutions and institutions that have cooperated with the association during these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions during election campaign times proved the impartiality of the work done by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the celebrations were attended by the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former mayor and currently left-green city councillor Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family Affairs, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of the Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was launched in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far is "a good basis."
For the president of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a role model who knows how to fight against difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in trouble.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it is doing," he explained.
Occupied house where giant parties were held were vacated
The homeowners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on Balmes Street No. 51 (Barcelona) occupied.
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without resisting.
Everything points to the fact that the nightmares of the neighbors of the house No. 51 have come to an end on the street Balmes.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they illegally occupied and in which they had organized huge festivals that had driven the neighborhood to despair. The eviction was made by court order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," the property manager confirmed.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical facility and part of the water supply with them. In addition, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
In the three lower floors, huge parties were celebrated, which lasted up to two days and drove the tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage from it.
Her owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that her business would have declined by 80% since the start of the squat.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters made their unfair competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while these cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure restaurant had been reported by the neighbors for disturbance of peace, while according to her statement the noise did not stem from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and in particular from the guests of the festivals, which were organized there, and which, according to the statements of the angry neighbors, became more and longer in recent weeks.
The manager of the discotheque explained that the harassment had been so great that it agreed with the owner of the building not having to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (urban police) also confirmed that it has received more complaints from its neighbours in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in Barcelona's city council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had last week called for the building to be cleared immediately and to get a grip on the problems of bourgeois coexistence as well as the coming down of the district.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building had been occupied, but that the squatters had penetrated into all floors of the building and almost all the apartments in recent months. In some, thefts had even occurred.
In that sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to crack down on the asocial acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris neighborhood was cleared by Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached Montreal No. 35, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had watched four people want to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree with the tender, apart from the disputes over the fees.
The municipal call for tenders for the 16 gates opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now-vanished Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its insulting letter on the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
He was even compared in numbers with New York's Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park became the upper limit of Barcelona again in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread in a north-south direction, but upwards (mountain) and below (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park plays with this idea.
The role model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boar in the role of yogi bear.
So far, when the city issued a huge call in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either that's the case, or someone intends to put goals in the countryside.
The question arises of itself: Collserola, Park or Berg?
The call for proposals is not only from an organisational point of view, but also the topic of discussion in the mouth of all architects from Barcelona with regard to a reflection on the city.
It is almost a recurrent topic that two members of this old-established caste, who meet in the elevator, can fall back on.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare correspondences between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The tender is appropriate.
For Roldán "it is necessary" to talk about the "front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, who has not been carried out over the green apples.
"One should start from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," judges the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": it must not be imagined "as entrances to a park, but as a containment of areas in which action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, regards the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers."
Dangers due to the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings today" according to the experiences from the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the field of the forum.
The first fear is the own limitation to what may be built.
"To limit something always means to set the next step," i.e. to cross it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current [referring to the plan General Metropolitano (PGM) ] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who is more close to the question, thinks simply, the side of Collserola, which is heading towards Vallesana, "can be understood as a park that does not in the direction of Barcelona," for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronate of Collserola that should not "fall on deaf ears," although he is grateful to the city government for giving his panel the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment."
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the escort letter, which allows the architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" on whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams launched ("just the right thing," he says) "We architects should only be a tool."
Bayona hints that the answer to the question in the headline of this article is complex, since a global view of Collserola is missing from the tender conditions: "16 competitions were advertised in cross-section," he says, "on the axis mountainous sea. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area in its entirety.”
That has led, at least in his case, to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and the definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should absolutely guarantee that the strip is equipped in its entire length directly above the Ronda de Dalt in its entire length, creating a soft transition between the city and green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who is free
After 72 days of silence, the Casino Red plenipotentiary freed the mayor's brother of Monterrey from the trial being brought against him for alleged blackmail.
After 72 days of imprisonment, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after Casino Red's plenipotentiary has awarded him to the District's Second Criminal Court, which is leading the trial of the mayor's brother of Monterrey's mayor for blackmail.
After the assassination of the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, who is allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city government approves the secret operation of the betting house.
After the criminal complaint, the public prosecutor's office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panistic mayor, who on the 2. September was arrested for 30 days.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the capital's Barrio Antiguo.
At this location, he remained 49 days after a second arrest warrant after the Ministerio Público's official rejected the offences for bribery and organised crime.
On 19. He was transferred to the Cadereyta detention centre in October for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he remained in the middle security wing for only a few hours, as death threats were against him.
Authorities allowed him to take part in the court proceedings as the inmate of the San Nicolás de los Garza municipal prison.
On the 25. October was served a detention ordinance on him by the secretary of the District's Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez. He found that after the nearly two-month investigations, there was sufficient evidence to find Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in order to open it in return.
This Monday, Casino Red's representative, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to enact the sentence to the mayor's brother, which is why he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had repaired the damage and which of the owner of the betting house had expressed his forgiveness. The lawyer, however, withheld the name.
According to Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted. In the following, no objections can be made against the trial, and no compensation is required.
After the hearing of the representative of the betting house at 15:50, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, drove to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to tell Jonás that he had been acquitted and his case would be put to the records.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome announces details of the plane accident that killed government secretary Francisco Blake and another seven people.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results about the accident, which killed the government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and another seven people, indicated that the helicopter with all its intact structure directly bounced against the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communications and Transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before takeoff that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades had contact with trees at a height of 25 metres, with the helicopter losing the hull, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for the transport of the personnel.
He also said that no helicopter parts were found during the investigations in the area where the machine had come down.
"No aircraft parts were found elsewhere in the search, the mark-up affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, it is a priority to get the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Relief Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter had flown by the Estado Mayor Presidencial on the surcharge with cruising speed and the plane had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of the impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points to be considered in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In line with the flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew would have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at the start. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds drew up.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the crew had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Impact point:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter are in agreement. There may not have been a loss of control over the aircraft or a deviation from the flight route before the impact.
Disseminate the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available up to now indicates that the helicopter had bounced from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of scattered aircraft remains suggests the helicopter had impacted the ground with its unharmed structure.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft offer at the scene of the accident do not indicate fire or explosion.
The latest investigation results point to several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter has probably broken.
Some information suggests the helicopter may have had multiple ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area that went beyond the cordoned-off area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the unharmed aircraft structure had bounced against the ground.
MSS Announces a Research Protocol to Find the Gene for Obesity
She Social Security Institute of Mexico is leading a research project to find the gene for childhood and adolescents, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institution of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for childhood and adolescents under the title "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence," with which the genetic markers are to be found in conjunction with obesity.
Miguel Cruz López, Head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutrition specialists and social workers was established.
This team is supported by specialists and students of the postgraduate degree program at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and at the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the valley of Mexico, where tests with children and young people are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 a.m.
He stressed that the investigation began on the Cuauhtémoc sports field (in the west of the state of México) and has been going on since 8. October will continue on the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of México).
When the target of 500 to 600 investigators is reached, the study will continue on the Independencia sports field (in the south of the capital district) and will be completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the aim of the study was to get to know the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of obesity and the identification of risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents for the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the worldwide day of diabetes, he explained that it was sought that three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 should fill out nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and their family history of illness in order to control risk factors that could lead to diabetes or kidney failure.
He also stated that on the mentioned Saturdays, the subjects measured (weight, size, waist circumference), their blood pressure would be controlled and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt of identification of genes related to childhood obesity) would be determined.
Cruz López stressed that this investigation would be conducted on the occasion of health workers' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"The 1999 and 2006 health surveys found that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of the girls with obesity by 47 percent. Overweight has also increased dramatically," the IMSS specialist stressed.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was based on the genetic history of the population of Mexico differed from that of other peoples.
He said that a (e) Mexican (in) is on average 65 percent Native American, 30 percent European and 5 percent of African descent, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
In general, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of the energy (calories) taken to us, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit to the participants would consist in a comprehensive study of the children, which would determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even examine the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the pre-stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain all measurement results to the parents and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three fundamental factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, that is, lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamals, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University of UNAM, is using polymers to develop modified asphalts to make the mixture more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention were paid to the signs that originate from the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 potholes if the rainy season at the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (city area of the Valley of Mexico) breaks out, said Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at the University of UNAM, warning and assured that if the laying out and maintenance of the asphalt surface are adequately reduced
In his lecture "Pothles from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year on Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalts modified with polymers in order to produce a mixture similar to the asphalt, but which has greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as in some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of the petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltene - and the other part a low - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic tough-elastic behavior.
Tough-elastic behavior of the asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, at 120°C it is very viscous and almost solid at 50°C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on the weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," the chemical engineer explained.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City had a majority of a flexible road surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which included asphalt.
Between the top layers lies a wear layer of asphalt, which consists of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
If the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be even better distributed," the chemical engineer said.
"Across the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called support layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. of sand, which was also bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require a greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must produce friction.
The most forces of this road surface are received and distributed, the support layer also requires an appropriate thickness and the material it is made of must be maintained.
The weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other, important factors to consider, especially the water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behavior of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes moist, water penetrates the layer and only emerges again with difficulty. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole is created," he said, "the cover layer is first removed, while the wear layer is only impaired afterwards. But the damage does not occur immediately, but is a process that would have to be maintained at the first signs through appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load was another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of the road surface must always be in relation to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is observed in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that many more research work was still waiting, for example about asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which the potholes could be repaired simply and without the application of high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate del Valle to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle gets his 14th Mistitles.
Once again, Valle del Cauca went blank when awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to be content to be on the winning podium, to display a silver crown and the ribbon she identifies as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and the cedar, the department already comes to 14 mistitles and Melina joins the Legion of Women from Valle del Cauca, who had almost held the crown in their hands. The proclaimed misses include: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1991)Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite, who had shown at every screening that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of the Police and the Mejor Rostro Jolie of Vogue, titles that the beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro had also received, and who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered crucial to the jury's decision to appoint her first miss is that she had not convinced the answer to the question "What book has influenced you most and why?", which had been asked to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I pretty much believe in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing, ultimately I believe that the book that shaped the most for my childhood is 'The Little Prince' is a rather profound book.
I am currently reading `guilt and atonement'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I am currently reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that is called `Passions'.
An answer that met with little mutual love, firstly because of the term ‘clibrate itself’ and secondly, because it had not concretely explained how each book she mentioned had influenced it.
But after the ceremony concluded, Melina declared to feel calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little `The Little Prince.' It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota indicated that the fact that she was the preferred one who received all the acclaims and who had received all the prizes in advance (Easter gastronomy competition, audience vote on the best hand-tailed costume and Reina Madre) "had made the other contestants jealous, which the queen stressed, who therefore could not shine on stage."
And this was noticeable at her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she certainly appeared with both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico flaunted.
Ariel Osorio, journalist for the "Como en casa" program at the RCN channel, said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not become queen after all."
In addition, Valle went out of the way at the end of the press - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle was unable to convince the jurie regarding her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty pageant.
It will already be grounds that two days before the international jury's compilation, Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derrier and fibrosis, which was noted in the stomach area. But that's contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for `natural beauty' with a healthy body, good dietary habits and responsible physical work.
The coach of the queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem with the fibrosis on the stomach, which was frankly hard to notice for me, squeezed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos is of the opinion that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical interventions she had undergone.
"The operations are ok, but Valle didn't know how to get them done right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay this place.
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Competition, a cruel prediction emerged after the appearance in the bathing suit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo had given Melina a consolation prize so as not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether that's true or not, the fact is that Melina is starting her year of rule from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that offers her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions on the appointment of the National Beauty Contest.
However, as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming appearance for Cartagena, the crown has been eluded, will go down in history.
Such was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano."
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last 4. In November, a lopscopist of the investigative unit of the prosecutor's office (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing the fingerprints.
Of the seven lophoscopists in the CTI department, this week Eliazar González had volunteered, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he frequently had to go to the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the required courses he specialized in lophoscopy, which is the examination of the skin, which is exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and foot surfaces.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
Friday night he flew in a helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew he was supposed to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one could be that of the man who had run the oldest guerrilla in the world. That's why he should take the ten-finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his actual name) with him.
However, when he reached the place where the corpse was located with the most examination, he could not identify it because of his physical appearance, because this did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media, in the least.
He had no beard, was dressed like a farmer of the area, did not wear glasses and was very much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a planting trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the corpse's fingerprints to those on the imprint sheet.
He had seen right: It was "Alfonso Cano."
Even the same night, this man, from Puerto Tejada, was responsible for telling the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was actually the head of the FARC.
In search of traces
For a dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the appreciation given to President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the use against "Cano" was very important.
Many people don’t know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science without an error rate, which can be a key factor in the resolution of a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify bodies, they also support investigations into murder and robbery matters and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arrested, many criminals present false identification papers or they have none.
We take the fingerprints off them and search for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house in a theft, because the thief had supported himself with his hand at this point when he pulled out a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprint removal. But in this case, we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had taken part in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of the fingerprints, murder suspects can also be exonerated or charged.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
The investigation was suspected that a family member might be suspect, and in fact, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, he is nevertheless associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A Dactyloscopeist of the CTI explained that "the fingerprints with chemical or physical reagents would be taken from the object."
When they appear, a planter or ribbon is used for taking it.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identification papers," explained the expert from the CTI.
He said that not everything was as it would be portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not all gold, which shines, is not all that you touch, a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make a corresponding comparison.
The "indignants" are challenging authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters crowded into tents in Zuccotti Square.
Much of it complied with the eviction order and changed its location to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement this Tuesday challenged New York authorities when they tried again to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared from the square at dawn and trying to occupy another place on the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters crowded in front of Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to gain access with a court order that allowed the "indignants" to camp again at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement adhered to the eviction order, occupying a park further north in the city, where there were nine arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp in the square, we will come together in another place and continue the battle by legal means to return to Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmans for the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray stated that the "indignant" response to the eviction of her tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced eviction of the square and authorizing the protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indignants" occupied a new park, located at the intersection of the centrally located Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is the property of Trinity Church.
They were able to occupy the place for at least an hour. But after that, police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, though Bray can't give exact numbers. He assured the Efe news agency that he had also seen several journalists handcuffed underneath.
The organization assures that hundreds of people have gathered at this point, where a secondment of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support of the members of the movement and to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a private property site) remains closed in anticipation of a judicial hearing still scheduled for this Tuesday, and at which the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn is to be analyzed.
Some of the protesters driven off the square carried photocopies of this judicial order with them and distributed them. They even gave it to some police officers guarding the square, which resulted in "some small clashes," as Bray reported, who had indicated that some police officers had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from clearing members of Occupy Wall Street from the square as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting the protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other stuff they had used before."
Mayor Bloomberg clarifies to the press that, because of this court order, the reopening of the square to the public traffic and the protesters had been lifted. The protesters pointed out that the city laws did not allow them to set up again with tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square, which was carried out at dawn, in which nearly 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violated the right."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evict the square because he had "turned into a place where people did not come to demonstrate, but to break the laws and in some cases to harm others" because "some business would have received threats" and local residents were "frightened for their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting the financial interests rather than protecting the interests of North American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
Those in charge of "Occupy Wall Street" informed that they were thinking about organizing "big actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to the two months the protests have been going on since 17th. September is already lasting, to commemorate.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary on the TV Christmas show
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will be on 1. December appear in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas"
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," lifeguard in "Baywatch," rabbit on "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show of Canadian television.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson along with the "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities on the 1. December in the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" will appear and breathe life into a very special Virgin Maria.
CTV today circulated images of the television program in which Anderson - who also appears for the distribution on the Internet of a self-shot porn, in which she appears along with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe," Tommy Lee - as a virgin Mary with a doll in her lap, which is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American origin who recently worked as a presenter on the show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, appears as a baby Jesus.
CTV's Christmas program not only relies on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, at one of his concerts in New York, Bublé had referred to North American Kim Kardashian as a "whore."
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy had been paralysed, which is still in recovery after the destructive earthquake that culminated in a nuclear crisis, and the worst disaster that Japan is to 2. World War had experienced.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo assessed the property damage to 300 000 dollars, a blow that seems to be weakening despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of continuous cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September served to finally conclude this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% to the year-on-year rate.
The value measured in the second quarter - in Japan the financial year begins in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline for investments recorded from January to March, the first decline after six months of unstoppable increases.
Despite this, the actual turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, initiated by the growing expenditure on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has confided in the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - flees into one of the "refuge currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone's debt crisis and the murky forecasts for the U.S.A., a privilege that, like a tombstone, weighs on the accounts of export companies.
With a tougher currency, the products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy is based on the health of major technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak business results from July to September to the yen's listing.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, for example the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," said Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy.
The perspectives are really not very sneering.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that most member states had clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which precedes the turning points of the global economy, brought to light that the brakes would have been drawn at the greatest economic potencies.
Because he dropped by four-tenths to loose 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below that average, which is at 100, having fallen by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says the austerity measures would be passed, but the Conservatives will not sign a written deal
With the high-altitude risk premiums of the peripheral countries and widespread uncertainty, Greece is also further lost in the labyrinth that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek interim government is more of a reaction to the pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being proved by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, pointed out yesterday that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon in his appointment may be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative party Nueva Democracia, Antonis Samaras, assured that he would support the new austerity measures and by no means his demand for new elections on the planned date, the 19th. February, will take back.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit of 26. October was hit," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will peak tomorrow with the vote of confidence for the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, the reform of disciplinary law for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's communication does not clear the doubts about his stance: "We have committed ourselves to support the transitional government, but otherwise to nothing."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that needs to unlock the 8000 million Athens desperately needs. He clarified that he would not approve a commitment on the fulfilment of the austerity measures.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated by the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that it was not to be shaken by its demand: economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties "do not sign a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika's inspectors were coming back to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed for the payment of the sixth section" amounting to 8000 million euros, even though there is no final date yet.
The Greek skein still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "predominant" position on this type of funding
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the role of micro-financing worldwide."
The Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has become the second donor for this means of international cooperation worldwide in the last two decades. His "being" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity on the basis of trust in man."
The Queen yesterday inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that these types of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium targets set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal, the number of people who have to live on incomes of less than one dollar a day, i.e. below the "poverty limit."
Spain "continues to work" on expanding the beneficiary network "to the last corner of the world and it is carrying out this task responsibly," noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will run from the summit, which lasts until Thursday, will be "guaranteed to create new capacity and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have recorded many successes" and "stand by many challenges."
The summit on micro-credit is not only a forum for debates, but also a platform to kick-off "two fundamental goals."
The Queen said it was seeking to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and that ten million of these households would cross the poverty line by the end of 2015.
The conception of the micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition."
She described the father of this financing instrument as an "admirable idealist who has dedicated herself to the fight against poverty" and whose work she has known for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to get to know the loan strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings on Ivory Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all, "we have been able to observe a continuous development," explained the Queen, whose commitment to this project yesterday earned her the assessment as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as an "advocate of the poor."
Finally, Queen Sofia ended her lecture by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to find solutions in the fight against poverty.
'Ethical bid'
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic booms, because it was a "permanent obligation."
Jiménez was of the opinion that the micro-credits were a "serious and rigorous policy of eradicating poverty," and that the governments of industrialized countries now had to work "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and should not allow the solidarity of the crisis to fall victim.
For Spain, micro-credit is one of the "most important forms of development aid."
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success," "marginalized" people "who are always in front of closed doors" to "give hope" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens their gates, infected by the spirit of solidarity."
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president on the basis of general voting
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU on Monday, the 14th November in Leipzig went without real difficulties for Angela Merkel, chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, in particular to satisfy those activists who regard the Greeks’ policy today and possibly Italy tomorrow as too lax.
The European Commission's presidential motion proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Among 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The several minutes of standing ovation, which initially applied to Angela Merkel and Wolfgang Schäuble a few hours later due to their intervention decrees, leave no doubts open on the part of the three European-incoming finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea - as well as the requests - bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "no less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also there "nine million jobs directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be expressed by an amendment to the Lisbon Treaty, which strengthens the control of the European Union, with regard to the budget policy of the countries in the eurozone; however, this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general voting in order to give Europe a face."
However, this is in any case one of the motion proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly stood by Wolfgang Schäuble Godfather.
Certainly, it is little likely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the matter, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy agrees with the same opinion.
However, the milestone is set.
Likewise, the delegates have overwhelmingly rejected the proposal of the weighting of each country in the ECB board according to the weighting of the individual economies, which would obviously entail an strengthening of Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is looking for calming the climate within her party, has therefore reinforced the reference points to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, she has no longer tried to win her congress at the expense of the "little" or the European countries in trouble, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
As far as the European motion dedicates a paragraph to the significance of the "French-German friendship," Angela Merkel does not call France on the plan.
At least not directly.
Because this is reminiscent of the fact that two centuries ago Leipzig was the focus of a bloody battle.
In fact, one of the most highly humbling defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does the fraud represent in sick reports?
After the family allowances, UMP and the government are now taking up the sick reports.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15th November arrive in Bordeaux to visit a family allowance fund and to present a speech on the issue of the fight against social fraud and economic dependence on the state, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which is based on the effort to put the economy to a test of hardship, but on the other hand, it is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on employee sick reports.
First, with budgetary objectives: the government is targeting the introduction of a fourth waiting day before taking into account a sick report on workers in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the wages of four days without the approval of the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that threatens to provoke anger, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And which would be accompanied by a different measure of a rather symbolic character: to give the state officials an unremunerated waiting day in the case of illness (so far there is no waiting period for them, in contrast to the three waiting days in the private sector).
Meanwhile, these questions are in the discussion, the majority is also rekindling the subject of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absence of work.
"Controls will be significantly more important, and beyond that, these are repayable if required," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, the 13th. November in front of the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the effects of this report on the reality of fraudulent acts in the area of sickness reports seem a little disproportionate.
This has indeed been the subject of permanent observation since 2002, as well as political offensives that have borne fruit most often.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let's first linger with the nationwide digits.
According to the Landeskrankenkasse CNAM, more than 237 million euros of daily severance payments were paid in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of the Health Care System, the daily severance payments in 2008 represented 11.3 billion euros in 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% in maternity leave, occupational accidents and 54% of sick leave, which means 6.2 billion euros.
And 2.5% health care expenditure.
In 2010, the French were admitted to an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
One mean that covers up certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, website for career planning, showed that 75% of the 40. 000 interviewed, French workers said that they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, clarifies that 37% of sick reports in 2010 were of less duration than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers do not tend to be incapacitated more than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absence rate (substantiated or otherwise justified) oscilled, namely in France between 10% and 11% against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The fraud in sick reports represents a vanishingly small proportion in terms of undeclared work.
With regard to fraud, only a weak extent is achieved here.
The reinforcement of the legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic checks on sick reports that exceed 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public college of education and training of technicians and engineers) found under 1.5 million checks that 13% of the 285,000 of the realized, short-term sick reports, that is, in 37,050 cases, were unjustified or too long.
In the case of the systematically controlled sick report cases of more than 45 days duration, less than 1.2 million 11% of "unadjusted or unjustified" cases were counted, which is 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases on several million workers who have claimed a sick report.
A digit that represents only a weak extent compared to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to the UMP deputy Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this question published in July, this represents between 9 and 15 billion euros in tax loss per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily allowances, and thus much more than the defraudation at the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to capture its economy.
This was announced on Monday, 14 November by the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos in front of the Parliament, with the fact that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to complete this task.
"In order to continue the efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners as well as a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on Parliament's vote of confidence.
Implementation of the Euro Summit on 27. Decisions taken in October was the "main task" of the new government, as the participation of the country within the eurozone was "at stake," as he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos planned to reduce the country's government deficit "around the 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after this was 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The rights reject the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday given his approval of the already approved measures regarding an attempt to escape from the debt crisis, but forwarded that his party would not agree to an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of members of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight against waste, but was hostile to any policy that would prevent the economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, an EU commissioner entrusted with economic and monetary tasks, who had prevented the IMF and EU from releasing the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties about their support of the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and accompanied suicide must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
The Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians worked together to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and beyond the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in a denial attitude towards death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions in which they want to die and make dispositions to this end.
This is one of the conclusions of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, in which six experts were involved who are linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the criminal law in such a way as to allow accompanied suicide and euthanasia where this choice arises, in the case of patients who are considered to be able to make such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent company EIU, which had compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the globe.
Although Canada is on the 10th. Rank has placed, the study notes, that "medical death care in Canada has produced a culture where people are afraid to cut the subject of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkilling agents, according to the experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of the Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of these ultimately die in the hospital.
Viewed from the whole country, the rate is highest at 86% of hospitalized deaths in Quebec.
On the delicate question concerning euthanasia and accompanied suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions, which are opposed to the position of the federal government, which has already expressed no need to make any changes to the criminal law regarding euthanasia and accompanied suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts, who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach have legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and accompanied suicide, there is no proof that such decriminalization would entail abuses in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or accompanied suicide of uncompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, much more cases of such transgressions are encountered, especially in the countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed in a teleconference yesterday.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Even accompanied suicide is practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians support euthanasia
Let us remember that, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already spoken in favor of euthanasia, because they believe that they allow individuals to alleviate their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia does not result in conveying the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people are less valuable.
With regard to the persons who have already practiced an accompanying suicide, the respondents represent 41% of the opinion that they should not be prosecuted.
As for maintaining or cessation of funding in patients, situation is less clear, according to the report's authors.
Likewise, these suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the deposition of the funds for which a legally valid rejection had been present should not be considered criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the task of respecting the end-of-life funds, and to fear this without criminal prosecution.
The panel stated that governments, health care institutions and physicians worked together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, and this goes beyond the cancer cases.
Most recently, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-encompassing measures already widely applied in the Canadian institutions for health care, the panel is at least considering them, since these served as little as euthanasia to reduce physical pain and relate to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of health care have already raised reservations about the conclusions of the expert report of the Royal Society of Canada.
RA Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the attitude of the report-signing experts, among other things, as "extreme", since this does not set any limits to the euthanasia practice in the case of the sick in the final phase.
"This opens the gates to a situation where anyone who is life-tired and older than 18 is asking another person to assist him in his suicide," according to RA Deschamps, who had reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place the individual’s own responsibility above all other values involved in the social impact of society.
But now, he says, there would be "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a health law specialist, has also expressed "a strong resistance" to the report's conclusions, which she described as a "pro-euthanasia manifesto."
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, doubts in particular the reports regarding the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and accompanied suicide are legalized, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan is calling on President Assad to resign from power
Damascus denounces a "plot"
Syria is increasingly isolated
The partisans of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the authorities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syria of Bashar al-Assad, which, however, counters this thanks to the support of Russia and rejects a "complacy" directed against the country, has intensified yesterday.
Two days before the Arab League's exclusion of Syria, the European Union has tightened its sanctions on Damascus, even though Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighboring countries, had taken a position in favor of a resignation from President Assad.
King Abdullah II Of Jordan yesterday, the incumbent Arab prime minister who had called on President Bashar al-Assad to "resign his official power in Syria" in which around forty civilians and members of government power have already been killed.
"If Bashar were to have his country's interest in heart, he would step down, but in addition, he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of political Syrian life," the king of Jordan, neighboring Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
Turkish diplomat Ahmet Davutoglu, for his part, had complained that the Turkish mediation attempts, which had been directed to the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year, had not been successful.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy it must go," he explained, in reference to Syria, the neighboring country, to which Turkey is taking a steadily rougher stance.
The United States, for its part, has welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad, as well as the machinations of the Syrian regime" as a result of the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"International community, United States, EU, Arab League and countries like Turkey have struck an increasingly sharp tone in the face of repression in Syria," observes Mark Toner, a spokesman for the state department.
During this period, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the government power in the region of Dar'a in southern Syria have died, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights OSDH.
Two other civilians had died in "gunshot changes and serious bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to this NGO.
On the occasion of a press conference, the Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim was nevertheless of the opinion that the country "taxes towards the end of the crisis".
By the way, he has reacted emphatically to the decision of the Arab League to suspend Damascus from his duties, which, in his estimation, represents a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not yield," he added, under the assertion, "the plots forged against Syria would fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently investigating a "protective mechanism for civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Trade Minister Alain Juppé had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from the regime's repression that he is encapsulating himself in his "paranoia."
A new assembly of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to implement the one on 2. Plans decided to declare a crisis trip in November, but in particular the controversial, expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday deemed the Arab League decision "incorrect" to beware of the advocacy of possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already admonished Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti urges markets to be patient and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, future Italian head of government, has demanded a little more time from the markets to form his staff and implement a program that "claims" to regain creditworthiness lost during the final months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties yesterday before today's clash of trade unions and employers' landlines.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in parliament, which is relatively strict of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, Member of Parliament, one of the numerous smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting with the incumbent President of the Council.
Gianfranco Fini, president of the Chamber of Deputies, had for his part waited to see Mario Monti put a vote of confidence in parliament by Friday to make sure the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements are made in the one of M. Monti's presentation of a deletion list that will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock market and bond markets called for their time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government as well as a government program, he stressed, under the remark, it was "certain that the markets will show themselves to be patient and commitant."
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected industrial production decline in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should establish a staff consisting of predominantly technocrats, although he had emphasized that he would also like to involve "politicians".
The new government should only pass until 2013, the date of the next general election, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the confidence of parliament by Friday.
M. Since the recording of his function, Monti has committed himself to working in all the urgency in the sense of the goal of making Italy the "renewed protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis towards the Italian economy does not change even taking into account the new government."
The EU, which is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget compensation target in 2013 despite the austerity plans taken up in these last few months, has in particular applied for new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, head of the chief executives" of Italy, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need for economic boosting," since a country that has no growth whatsoever cannot respect the deficit figures."
M. Monti, who is known for his competence as well as his independence as EU commissioner (1994-2004), stands for a "change of epoch" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as an "other Italy," according to the editorial authors.
The great unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy now has to pay for 200 billion euros of state bonds from April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop an explosive capsule that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute of Science and International Security ISIS is based on the recent report of the International Agency for Nuclear Security AIEA and other documents originating from this UN agency to determine this scientist.
The AIEA had last week communicated its "serious concern" on the occasion of a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to extensive studies of the AIEA documents on the part of ISIS, Danilenko, who was born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) since the beginning of the 1960s and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds produced by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he is said to have left the center to start a company in Kiev that produces "nano diamonds."
His company's economic difficulties would have led him to contact the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he had then participated in an Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that the Iranian development" of a nuclear explosive system" had been supported by the work of a foreign expert who was not only primarily proficient in this technique, but also, as a member of the state told the agency, had worked his entire professional career about this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and crimes have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, whereas other racist or religiously motivated violent crimes have either declined slightly or only slightly increased in the same period, according to FBI statistics released on Monday.
According to this data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, whereas a 13% increase in violent acts against Catholics, a 4% decline against Jewish crimes and a global increase of 14% of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate-motivated crimes" has risen to 6,628 cases in a very weak majeure, including 47.3% due to racial differences and 20% by religious differences of motivated crimes, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is worrying to see these crimes and crimes grow again," the human rights organization Human Rights First stressed."The rise in anti-Islamic acts of violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First had emphasized for a long time that the violence directed against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, a leader of the organization.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these assaults," he added, assessing that this could be done while improving the police stance on the "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" presents itself in American federal law as an heir from the epoch of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King in order to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or descent and now also include crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and is more and more like Facebook
The microblogging website Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday to enable its users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their entries, which once again makes the service resemble that of Facebook.
The new tab "Activity" and another"name" better allow you to understand the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("tweets") are followed and the following your messages.
This allows you to find out if they allow you to follow your messages, whether they subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet spread on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, equipped with somewhat esotherically suggestive wording (RT for the referenced repetition of another person’s post after).Friday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus a
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" over the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and too similar to Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The "Activity" function will help me to better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," @dannykronstrom said in a statement.
Austria
Registration of a "Golden Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the large Social Democratic/Christian Democratic coalition, which is in power in Austria, decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also to avoid any degradation on the part of rating agencies in the top creditworthiness of Austria (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann who had announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public Austrian national debt is 74.6%, far above the criterion of 60% set by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen from AAA to AA+ in one fell swoop, we would have to pay three billion euros in additional interest every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, vice-chancellor and Christian Democrat foreign minister.
Austria is also calling for the Brussels summit of eurozone member states to be called for 26. October instead: The Heads of State and Government would have demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012, as well as a return to the public account balance in the constitution or by adopting an equivalent law.
The measure taken by the Austrian government is similar to the "German model" since Germany had been the first European country to include such a "rule" in the constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should be reduced by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and from 2017 the state’s structural budget deficit should not exceed the 0.35% limit of GDP, whereas the regional countries, as well as the municipalities, should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to honour the budget debt in the horizon of 2020/21 under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement.
Strong yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda on Tuesday warned that Japanese authority would again intervene in the currency markets should the yen continue to rise.
"Should we establish excessive volatility" in the yen's exchange rate, we will intervene just as we did the last time," M explained. Noda in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen, in turn, had spiked close to the historic levels that Japanese authorities had on 31. October forced to intervene.
That day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars to lower Japan's foreign exchange value, which is about to head for a new record high since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen regularly over it, doped by purchases from investors who see the yen as a "refuge" in these uncertain times of world economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro has slipped below the symbolic slat of 105 yen close to the levels that had triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar listed around 120 yen, the euro more than 160 yen.
This straw fire from the Japanese motto harms the exports of the archipelago, as it increases the cost of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange it in national currency.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11. March, which has ravaged the Tohoku region (Northeast), for its reconstruction," M insists. Noda, who fears that this price of the yen can kill the weak upswing in the bud.
The third economic world power, with growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter-, has once again gained traction for the first time this year thanks to skyrocketing export increases and the consumption of households "plomped" by the disaster.
The Prime Minister, however, estimates that the price of the yen does not "reflect the economic foundations of Japan."
For his part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to invalidate the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has informed that the BoJ has already initiated "suitable measures," with which he announced that no additional currency easing was to be expected on Wednesday.
On the occasion of the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank had increased its state bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to repay the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
Interest rate feet skyrocket, stock exchanges back down
The risk of contagion of the debt crisis constantly undermines the European key figures.
Despite the taking office of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise.
The exchanges, still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are also drifting this Tuesday, the 15th November a little more into negative realms.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% by 10 a.m., falling to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt declined 0.4%, while London declined by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions over government bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global stock markets are continuing to issue a portion of their recent gains.
"The investors are nervous and only too well aware of the risk of contagion," Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, explains, quoted by the Reuters press agency.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange, which in turn is suffering from the renewed fear of market participants in terms of capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, had closed with a bearish of 0.7%.
""Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trading is moving on limited variation corridor as long as investors have no evidence that the situation has stabilized," estimates Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the eurozone's future is damaging the single currency, which continues its baiss on Tuesday.
The euro has been moving at its lowest level for a month and a half.
Around 10 a.m., the European Valuta was worth 1.3570 dollers, so it gave up 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, which had gathered in Congress on Monday, granted a motion that in particular provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to quit the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% limit.
Italy and Spain's loan interest rates remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the return of Italian bonds reached 6.85% for 10 years, and that of the Spanish titles matured to 6.2%.
These tensions of interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investor fears.
Future Italian Prime Minister Mario Monti called for more time from the markets to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
For his part, the new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed the implementation of the on the occasion of the on 27. October eurozone summit decisions made are "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets as parliamentary elections are held in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate gap between the German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
In anticipation of eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, which was a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office (INSEE) had revised the beard of the figures for the second quarter, with a decrease of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of a stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries economic experts the most.
Germany, for its part, had a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
An initial projection of the entire eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of a renewed recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts should prevail over dogmas
If there is a topic that must not be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, this is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an occasion to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores the total economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050, not an enormous proportion of the world’s population should have to do without a vital element.
At the same time, the scarcity of fossil resources must be mitigated in order to continue to produce electricity without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to live in isolation in its decision to refrain from nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which subjects its decision to the need to find a substitution-capable source of replacement, nor in Switzerland, which just intends to build only nuclear power plants of the last generation.
Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name just a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
The United States, for its part, has decided to join its park in addition to its park by re-operating the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which is geared towards renewable energy sources, is occasionally set as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in the form of a price increase in the price of electricity, an increased energy dependence on import gas, especially on Russia, an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
The totality of these unpleasant effects will become apparent within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
Denmark is, on the one hand, the European leader in the table in terms of wind energy, from which it draws 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country is one of the strongest users of coal and gas, alternately used with wind energy; due to this, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are each 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average value.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill, unlike our French households.
Since the price of energy in the globalised economy is a key role in competitiveness and a demand for industry stability on national soil, French companies have an advantage due to the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Polls found that this was a price that the vast majority of French people are just as willing to pay as they show opposition to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a large number of specialized small and medium-sized companies to the international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
Should France decide to phase out nuclear power, most of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the annual 6 billion euros in capital goods and nuclear energy exports would shrink more and more.
Which electrician would commission an EPR designed to work for sixty years if the decline of its producer was pre-programmed?
In order to solve the energetic equation, it must be admitted that there is no more a miracle drug for the generation of electricity than a devil's work.
The low-carbon solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of security is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a security agency that carries out uncompromising and transparent checks in existing plants such as construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, who have made a name for themselves because of their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the security idea.
Within 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious incidents.
Only one, namely in Three Mile Island, has occurred under normal operating conditions; so it went without consequences for people and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was conjured up by reactor construction as well as inend-custom, human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions that caused the deaths of several tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw its lessons from this accident as much as it had done after the two preceding ones.
As a fruit of this approach and a cooperation of the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a draft that enables it to be resisted by such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power plant, a construction stop in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF, leaving them free rein to take the leadership position in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that equally determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticized from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies on the basis of a policy subject to the figures, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights," as France had titled itself.
Recently, the harassment directed against foreign students from the authorities had shaped the newsreels, the interior minister had casually (see Libération of 23. May) announces that France "does not need talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad."
But this policy has rarely been analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a wide-ranging consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
From the right, the tone of Jacques Chirac was struck, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed people, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country," from the left by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 had stated that France "could not absorb all the poverty in the world."
The only difference is in the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of the national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared in 2005 from both the right and the left.
From both camps, the immigrants were perceived as a burden to the economy and French society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity that is willing to admit to immigrants.
Francois Hollande limits his programme to banalities that indicate that partnership development allows us to solve our "migration problems."
This notion of immigration as a burden, as a problem, can potentially affect the elections; however, it is economically costly.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron present to us in a recent work that summarizes the latest findings regarding immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 p.), there is a broad consensus among the specialists regarding the positive influence of the immigrant flood on economic growth, wages and jobs in the immigration countries.
Restricting immigration would invalidate growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears about the influence of the migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to substitute the domestic workers, especially the less skilled, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in truth much more complementary than the domestic wage workers, since they focus on occupations in sectors that are unutilised in terms of employment.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract any incentives to domestic wage workers, the more skilled among immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not matched to the supply of work.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country where there is a lack of anesthesisists, so this complementarity also between locals and migrants has a positive effect of immigrant influx on wages and the domestic labour market situation.
Giovanni Peri has calculated in this way that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants brings about a co-involved, long-term increase in real wages between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity of idea creation and economic growth brought in by the immigrants is beneficial (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
The migrants also contribute net to the social systems, in the European countries on average about 1% of the total budget.
The World Labour Organization estimates, for example, that a person who immigrates to Germany at the age of 30 contributes on average a net contribution (income minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing intersections "with the teeth" to start his mandate.
However, these said teeth, which were supposed to deter immigrants, achieved exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens, more than two thousand years ago, the entire 20. Century about the tragedies of the First World War, of totalitarianism, of the Holocaust, of the Gulag, but also Francos in Spain, Salazars in Portugal and the colonel in Greece had endured.
Some had probably believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible to see democracy prevail over its enemies once and for all.
One knows since Napoleon "the little one" that it was a feature of the attitude of mind.
The universal right to vote, which is the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient condition for this and can just as well become an "instrument of oppression" as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires far more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, separation and control of the powers, an education, an enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, a jurisprudence.
The crisis in Europe we are in is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first of all a political and democratic crisis.
The change of mind of the Greek truth-false referendum would have had a double insightful character in this respect: once that of the necessity of a powerful return of politics, but on the other hand also that of the disturbing feeling of their impossibility, their inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
Truth is that the front lines of democratic struggle have shifted today, and that the Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in pushing for a success of the domestic referendum, which was organized in dependence on the necessities and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European sole ruler or a leap blindfolded into the void of nationalist withdrawal: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, of full law, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time on a European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - by the way, you don't know where to end the list anymore - since there is only one crisis, and this is prevailing in Europe.
It is all of Europe that is bowing to the dictates of the markets and credit rating agencies, which suffer from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is all Europe that is humiliated at international level.
One is troubled by transfers of sovereignty towards Europe - but it is all of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to restore the leadership of the European project to popular sovereignty.
Because it is because of the whole, whether the Europeans can reduce the burden of their debts, free themselves from the markets and initiate a future through investment.
The exit from the crisis has decisions at European level as a condition that cannot be made without total democratic legality, without certainly leading us into ruin.
After this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists was fought over for a long time, everyone is pushing European economic leadership today.
Agreed.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as it envisions citizens - would be a renewed folly and another impasse.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To create the republic in France, it took the fact of "creating" Republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not be enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to form a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by creating a more politically democratic Europe, a truly European people's sovereignty.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards become common goods
The world trade fair for smart cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic position.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 should actually end with a 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (EC cards, SIM card telephone), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is the contactless technology that allows payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card to a reading device.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year before, 460 million contactless smart cards were to be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent over 10% of the global smart card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in terms of contactless payment after lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept these.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless visa cards were spread.
Consumer markets, however, are steaming.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speed, it is now necessary for the banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two large French financial institutions have committed to systematically handing out bank cards to their customers in the future, which are stocked with contactless chip," announces Gérard Nébouy, Director General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first stage on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A vanishingly small percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out these transactions.
“They’re in default.”
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"In 2012, we expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced yesterday the start of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE operates a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société Générale had also testified yesterday to prepare the market launch of an offer that allows its customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist front, of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspiced relations between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself had confirmed that Algiers had now "obtained certainty" about it.
"The way in which both organizations proceed, as well as the intelligence relations, suggest clear cooperation," he explained without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be doing a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French people in Niger, which took place last January, has brought to light interfaces.
The Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by supporters of the Aqmi, are said to have been killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors on the occasion of an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators are said to have found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the guided telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: one number leads to a Nigerian who had long been in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, who had been staying the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
“This is progress, but you don’t have to wait for clearer evidence before you can speak of an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem.”
"It is conceivable, however."
"For years, it has been known that the sect draws financial and intellectual support from the outside and that it is increasingly active," said the Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In these last months, these "support services" have become increasingly obvious in their course, as well as the speeches and the operating modes of Boko Harem, which now indicate the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives, which bear the same handwriting as those used by Aqmi.
The International Community, to start with Washington, has been putting pressure on Abuja since that time to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have indeed considered the grouping to be the community of Illuminati for a long time, which does not need to be given special attention.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram - which in Haoussa means "the Western education is a disgrace" - is persecuting the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
She politicizes herself and claims strict adherence to Sharia law, while the activists affiliated with her campaign against the ungodly central government.
The activists initially target churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, the activists of Boko Haram showed particular activity with their increased attacks against the commissioner's office.
However, the reaction on the part of Abuja is indifferentiated as usual.
The army surrounds the city, one counts 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who was taken in captivity, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect is becoming increasingly radical and leaving its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she confessed to an assassination attempt in Jos that claimed 80 lives, then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is assigned the blame of a suicide bombing that occurred at the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations became the primary international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has been worrying all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and the Niger, the Somalis operate on al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat at the center of the continent.
Last week, on the occasion of a discussion with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned about Boko Harem and showed himself ready to communicate all the information.
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry rival in simplification and ignorance of China, Iraq and assistance to Israel.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, not to say: simple-minded ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates like that, voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their colleagues have been repeatedly proclaiming their thunderous statements, as well as their statements regarding foreign policy, traditional Republican focus.
About China, Iran and Israel aid, slogans - often in no way underpinned - are falling.
Mitt Romney, who is highest in the course of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to quote the Chinese before the WTO and accuse them of "currency manipulation" - the leading topic in an America that is irritated by the emigration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupid run if this is to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost constricted his air in terms of his emotions-flattering behavior.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also the current attitude of Obama).
But Huntsman is not being heard as he stagnates in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran should sanctions fail to halt the nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran," he said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll get the bomb."
He has also promised Israel increased military assistance and accused Obama of remaining guilty of this partner’s obligations.
The entrepreneur Herman Cain, second highest ranked candidate, in turn shows a shameful file ignorance.
Recently, he called for a counter-to the Chinese military threat, as Beijing "tries to develop a nuclear power" - and seemed to ignore the fact that China has been in possession of military nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, is in turn ready to take the American army in Mexico into service against drug cartels.
The recourse to torture measures against suspected terrorists, which Obama banned in 2009, was also endorsed by Cain, Perry and the candidacy of Michele Bachmann.
One is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican nominee in 2008, a foreign policy heavyweight.
The current presidential counterparts, Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite all this.
They recall that Obama was also an amateur and had to give water into his wine in terms of counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecision in Libya, which also earned him the reputation of weakness.
However, this hostility is not so unforced.
The population is more likely to appreciate the positive balance of National Security under Obama that has turned off bin Laden.
Since Iraq, she has been wary of military interventions that lead to a slack.
And Obama is more appropriate by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to bring his leadership position to new life.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs on the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is intended to supply gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with splendor and glory.
Over 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline last Tuesday on the Baltic coast under orchestral sound system and at gourmet buffet, which directly connects Russia and Germany below sea level.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands have symbolically jointly turned the wheel of the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European network.
With the new gas pipeline, 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year are to be delivered to Western Europe through a first pipeline of 1,224 km in length, which connects the St Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
A second pipeline, which allows a total supply of 55 billion cubic meters of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption - is to be completed by the end of 2012.
And you already let the eventuality of the construction of a third line sound on its own track.
For Gazprom, the timely and precise completion of this enormous building looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will enable direct gas delivery to Germany, while avoiding any route by third countries (Poland or Ukraine) by land.
For this reason, these two countries are losing a little power: for them, it is now becoming more difficult to put pressure on Russia by threatening to enter Western European markets.
Warsaw, most committed to the debate, was not shy away from comparing the Nord Stream pipeline with a "new German-Asi-Soviet pact" in connection with the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the purpose of the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe has gained an even higher security of supply by advocating for this Russian project.
This, however, at the expense of an invalidation of European energy, as the project has struck a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
Russia has managed in barely five years to push through its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, Western countries that have strong gas consumption and whose gas deposits are running out.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us in an organic way," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out to what extent the major gas contracts are also important from the political and economic side.
All this explains the broad smile of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technology.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing, which is intended to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at about 200 m depth.
During their construction, mine fields dating from the Second World War had to be dodged.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect the fauna and flora.
The line is a long snake made of metal, heavy like 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything over the entire length: neither by valves, nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from this, as the Swedes were not eager to see a Russian state-owned company settle in a permanent way at the height of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas passage in less than a minute," Jens Müller clarified.
In the event of a leak, the gas located in the gas pipeline thus escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered unlikely by the designers, as the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas transmission is ensured both by an underwater robot, which is controlled for external observation purposes from a seagoing vessel, as well as by a device that circulates inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, with one meter diameter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three complete days of locomotion through the line at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about any deformations of the metal on its arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to function for fifty years without having to undergo even the slightest repair.
The gas circulation is easily ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the access point, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have combined their strengths to realize this project.
However, the line guidance remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, here are the German companies E. ON and BASF (each 15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group of companies GDF Suez (each at 9%).
These five companies have formed a corporate community called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then rented out the entire capacity of its gas transport to this company, namely on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real transported amount of gas fails," Jens Müller clarified.
The financing of the gas transmission construction was secured by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amount was 240 million.
However, minority shareholders are sure to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy coastline wooded with pine trees at Lubmin.
The 4.5-meter-high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per passing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Launched by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give the letter a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent by candlelight with writing.
The notebook of Moleskine is easily recognizable again, with its black, rectangular cover, its rubber band, the eggshell-colored sides, aged as if over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as it is known today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a specialist consultant for the company, is responsible for the market launch of the new product.
The notebook was inspired by a traditional production technique, called the Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton bag that is used, for example, for upholstery benches.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that goes back to 20. Century was considered an icon of avant-garde artists," explains Maria Sebregondi, now responsible for the brand at Modo Modo.
Success kicks in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and establish themselves with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is a long way from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine passes the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom picture of the buyers, because the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultivated and open-spirited customers.
The small, Italian company, which had 12 employees in its early days, now employs over 100 people and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notebooks in bookshops, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques of the city centers and is committed to enforcing its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which exist despite the upswing of the emails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the company Moleskine: Recently, the brand launched an exposition called "Detour (Detour) ", in which architects and artists exhibited their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a cover with a leopard pattern on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and cultural zeitgeist and knew how to diversify his products: bags, schedules, fillers, computer sleeves... The brand has the full range of items.
A success that brings envy to the plan: In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of the company Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today begins the"15. Work for the disabled."
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Disheartening?
"No, so emphasizes Éric Blanchet, director general of the Association Adapt, which is hosting the "Week of Work for the Disabled.""
"The progress made within fifteen years is considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not double, but threefold so high."
"Nonetheless, there is still a lot to do."
However, it must be said that for disabled unemployed people, numerous obstacles continue before they get a job.
More often, it hits the elderly: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with a higher education degree.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% among the disabled, compared to 38% in the overall average.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it more difficult to start work again, and which "form the core of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, Director General of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 that helps companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
Remains the unspoken, the attitudes of mind, which develop certainly, but still slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers surveyed have "a weak level of knowledge regarding the disabled" that is "over-represented" by persons in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually inferiors.
The result is that the private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go in order to achieve the employment target of 6% disabled workers, which was enshrined in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, originating from 2008, point to a quotient of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, reports the organization tasked with collecting contributions from companies that disregard this law.
The proof: The number of "fees of paying" permanent establishments, as well as the sum of the amounts paid in, decreased between 2007 and 2011, by a pay rate from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for contribution increases, created a strong pressure on the companies, Pierre Blanc explained."
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of permanent establishments employ between 20 and 49 employees who are disabled, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they foreheaded the "Blue Tuesday Evenings (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed their pleasure, which brought them the friendly game.
It would be too far to claim that there has been a secret agreement between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the spectator podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well have made peace.
Five months after his attacking player's spirited gesture against Turkey, the Belgian national coach had garnered nothing but praise regarding his person.
"I am very pleased with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look ahead," the native of Liller, for his part, assures.
As for the contrast between his portrayal in the club and the national team"It's a unit, that justifies everything."
"In Lille I am all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
“It’s time for me to start.”
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania regarding the match against France, to finally "shine."
Without, however, refraining from the note of "pleasure."
He has been cheering the French national team since the age of 7, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I have always been supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to reinforcing even more the "unique" character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he envisions.
“We just crossed paths.”
"To be able to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, hinted at "Pride" with good-naturedness.
"The pride of performing a galamatch."
"Pride" also to confirm - in his capacity as a "neighbor" - that France" has become a team at a very high level again," and that little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing in the next European Championship, the technician sees himself very well sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... in the direction of Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians are coming out big," he insisted.
“We’re planning a thing, the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.”
"You'll notice that at the upcoming games." The game against France included.
Portugal very confident
The Portuguese team of Paulo Bento looks forward to the return match against Bosnia (22:00 clock) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
In the first leg, both teams had lacked objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao," his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, that means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play, and an opponent to serve up, namely Bosnia.
Considering the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the dice have not yet fallen.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the important stamp on the matter, which would have taken the pressure off it.
"This is a good result, but it carries some risk, as we have not scored an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly shining Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to make their way through to an audience that should also be called on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic, but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but are completely convinced that we can win the upper hand," explained the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being part of the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can already be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"That's a good result, but it carries some risk, as we haven't scored an away goal," Bento regrets.
"We will compete against a squad that has high technical qualities and has players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese would plan to put maximum pressure on the Bosnians at the beginning, so as not to give them time to think."
A good idea, provided that it is put into action this time.
