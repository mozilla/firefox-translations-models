No liberating amendment for Tymoshenko by parliament
The Ukrainian parliament today rejected a motion to abolish the paragraph on the basis of which opposition leader Yulia Timoshenko was convicted as part of an amendment to the penal code.
The new regulation, which could have paved the way for the release of the imprisoned ex-prime minister, was rejected by MEPs at the second reading of the motion to mitigate penalties for economic offences.
Timoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison in October for concluding an allegedly adverse contract with Russia on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet final, in December the appeal of the convicted is to be heard in court.
Timoshenko himself describes the verdict as political revenge by the regime, and in the West, too, the trial raised suspicions of the court's bias.
The motion to remove paragraph 365, on the basis of which the former prime minister was convicted, from the penal code was supported by 147 MPs.
226 votes would have been required for its adoption.
Libyan victory
The history of the Libyan liberation struggle or Libyan rebellion already knows its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown location in the desert and without him the war is over.
Now only the winners have to be defined.
As is customary in this region, Islamists win the elections, the only question is which ones - the moderates or the radicals.
The National Transitional Council professed the customary law of the Sharīʿah, of which one now has a certain idea with God.
Libya would become a country without crime, because for theft you chop off your hand.
Women should also forget thoughts of emancipation as soon as possible, possible apostates are executed, and so on.
Instead of a single dictator, the society of mutually feuding tribes will in future be united by the Koran.
In short, an order will prevail in Libya that would be hard to imagine and, above all, hardly desirable in this country.
Only - our lifestyle is not the only one and objectively probably not the best and variety would hardly suit the Libyans mentioned.
From this point of view, it is rather strange that the Muslim fighters let themselves be helped by the infidel dogs at all.
Their excuse may only be served by the fact that NATO's air strikes were directed not by any American general, but by Allah himself, whose omnipotence was praised after each successful hit.
The winners in Libya? The West is not one of them.
We only took part in an exchange of fire, served the interests of Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of the dictator, without this having brought any advantage.
After the fresh and bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we preferred to refrain from a military occupation of Libya.
As a result, the locals are free of one concern - namely the expulsion of the crusaders.
But will the oil companies get the black gold at a ridiculous price even without occupation?
Hardly and so the West can finally rightly boast of its selflessness in the protection of human rights.
If the Sharīʿa representatives do not spoil this.
Beginning of a new crisis era
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Tuesday, a statistical storm raged through Europe.
The individual countries published their data on their GDP for the 3rd quarter.
The Czech economy stagnated compared to the previous quarter, while Germany and France are growing.
Today, however, the bond market is breaking all records.
Investors are keeping an eye not only on Greece, but now also on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the European zone, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other European countries published their preliminary forecasts for economic development in the third quarter.
As expected, Germany's GDP grew by 0.5% and France's by 0.4%.
At the same time, both countries revised their data for the second quarter, in which Germany recorded higher growth than originally expected (growth of 0.3% instead of 0.1% forecast), while France admitted a slight decline of 0.1% (initial data only spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in this year's third quarter.
Compared to the previous quarter, however, gross domestic product stagnated and, according to the Czech Statistical Office, the trend of slowing down in economic performance growth was confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the analysts' forecasts.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in this year's third quarter, but stagnated compared to the previous quarter.
According to preliminary and seasonally overcalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
Across the eurozone and the EU, the economy grew 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy shrank by 5.2 percent compared to the previous year.
The yield on its 10-year government bonds climbed to 28.45%.
The yields on Italian and Spanish government bonds rose to their critical limits.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also beginning to feel problems...
The yield on Czech government bonds remains below 4%, even as the situation in the region deteriorates.
In Germany, voices are being raised that the ECB should become the creditor of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for EURO
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and are now celebrating their qualification for 200 million
The football team has mastered the hardest task of the whole season!
Thanks to a well-placed goalkeeper Čech and a wonderful goal by Petr Jiráček, she won 1-0 in Montenegro.
With a large portion of luck, Czech football was able to defend its luxurious advantage from the home game and will once again not miss the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the promotion game in a detailed report.
Little excitement in the first half and a huge portion of luck in the second.
The Czech selection won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to the finishing weakness of the home team, a brilliant Čech's and the hero of the day Jiráček and thus redeemed their ticket for the European Football Championship.
Also because of the precise defensive play of the Czech team, they were able to put the Montenegrins under more pressure only in the second half.
The unlucky ones of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic, who missed two huge chances.
Also thanks to an excellent Petr Čech, the Czech selection will be involved in the European Championships next year, it is also pleasing that domestic football will receive a bonus of about 200 million.
From the first minutes on, quite combative football was played.
Both teams combined for a long time and so it was mainly played around the center line.
Also in the second half the pressure of the home team failed and the wide tees in front of the penalty area were successfully fended off by the Czech defense.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's core program.
They formed a living shield.
Several hundred college students formed a living shield around a core object in Iran.
With this gesture, they wanted to demonstrate their support for their country's core program against a possible Israeli attack.
The students had prayed in front of the object on Tuesday noon and then announced death to the US and Israel.
A few hundred students from the university in Isfahan, Iran, formed a living sign around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, where uranium is processed, on Tuesday.
They wanted to make it clear that they are prepared to protect their country's core programme, if necessary with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) recently stated in its report that Iran appears to have not given up its efforts to acquire a nuclear weapon.
Israel is also talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students had prayed at noon in front of the entrance to the complex and then announced death to the US and Israel.
According to the Israeli press, in the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing Iran's nuclear program as far as possible, the nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz would also be targeted from the center in Isfahan.
The menu of an obese child: he does not eat breakfast and eats sausage for dinner
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have problems with obesity, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children being overweight.
Recent surveys proved - obese children mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles.
This shows once again how important for the healthy development of a person is the environment in which he grows up and the examples that surround him.
On the tables of obese children, sausages are up to half more often on the table than in families in which normal-weight children live.
More than 19 percent of overweight children had fries for dinner the day before the educational campaign under the motto "Obesity is no coincidence".
In families with fat children, sports are not exactly one of the favorite pastimes, but this also affects the majority of today's students - only 15 percent answered that their parents find time for active exercise at least once a week.
Survey of 900 children
The survey took place last year towards the end of the school year, during which almost 900 children from primary schools throughout the Czech Republic were interviewed.
This was already the second year of the campaign "Obesity is no coincidence", which is supported by the Allgemeine Krankenkasse and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12 thousand students from 4th and 8th grades have participated in the project.
Unhealthy food and lack of exercise in the family are decisive factors responsible for the alarmingly increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"Only half of the children surveyed, for example, stated that eating breakfast five times a day in breakfast-second breakfast-lunch-vesper-dinner mode - one of the main prerequisites for a healthy diet," according to one of the survey results.
No breakfast and sausage for dinner
Experts point out that even relatively small things, such as the regular breakfast time of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23 percent of students' families eat breakfast.
And - in most families, everyone has breakfast on their own.
Worst of all, one in ten families does not eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast is considered the cornerstone of a healthy daily diet.
Among other things, the survey test revealed that families of overweight children consume unhealthy fries much more often.
And almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sweet sodas every day (70 percent)
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed do sports, less than half of their parents do so - only 15 percent.
Create your own menu
Another part of the survey enabled selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to put together their own meal plan according to their appetite and opinion.
"What Czech children between 12 and 15 prefer in terms of nutrition is far from the ideal of a healthy diet.
Among her favorite foods were many pastries, meat dishes and, of course, desserts.
"The great popularity of sweet sodas is particularly alarming," the final report on this survey emphasizes.
At lunch, i.e. the main course, pasta won just ahead of poultry.
The children almost did not like legumes at all and the popularity of fish and vegetable dishes as lunch was very low.
Return to health
At the same time, however, the survey also showed that children are quite willing to change their eating habits if they receive the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after completing the educational presentation "Obesity is no coincidence", there was in many cases a clear shift in preferences towards principles of healthy eating," the results of the project state.
This was evident, for example, in the sweet sodas, where many children began to give priority to ordinary water.
The children also ticked poultry or fish as the main course of the day much more often in the questionnaire and were willing to eat fewer dumplings or sweet foods.
Professionals claim - a stylist must also be a good psychologist
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I complained a bit that this was a bit too much stuff to start with.
I had no idea what was coming.
Lectures by three professionals from the industry, the clothing of problematic figures and a seminar on how it works "on the pitch".
Worse is set to come.
The closer the exam gets, the more information and practical tasks await us.
But even though the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, it is still fully booked.
This time we debated with director Alena (not a single man participates in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have an ideally proportioned figure.
And that's what most of us are, after all.
Some have a too short neck, others a too boyish figure without proper curves and still others are chubby.
It is up to the stylist to visually conceal broad shoulders, lengthen the neck or conjure up the necessary curves.
We also got tips on how to dress a type of woman like Jennifer Lopez - with a big breast, wide hips and narrow waist - pretty and figure-hugging, without making her look too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between waist and hips is so big that the skirt or pants really do not fit, you should at least have a piece tailored to measure.
You will certainly not regret this, because well-fitting clothing is simply priceless.
In such a tailor-made skirt you feel much better than in one off the rack, which always slides up and down, sticks out at the waist, etc.
Boyish figures, on the other hand, can afford to wear clothing with pleats, puffs, appliqués, embroidery or gathers.
With so much information and character types, I'm glad that I have a whole week to think about everything thoroughly.
And yet I am afraid that it is almost impossible to do in view of the assigned homework.
Each of the course participants was assigned a celebrity for whom she should come up with suitable outfits - daywear and evening gown.
In doing so, we should take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the corresponding star and his figure type.
I'm supposed to "attract" Miranda Kerr, whom you may know from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Inside, I'm cheering, because that's much better for me personally than, for example, dressing Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has probably gained a hundred kilos lately (well, that's a bit exaggerated), or even the young Selena Gomez.
We should cut out the garments from magazines or search the Internet, print them out and then edit them graphically.
In the "mood board", as the whole result is called, our very personal style and our relationship to graphic design should be expressed.
It is very important to also think about the graphic side of styling.
The stylist not only attracts the models purely physically, but also designs the so-called product page in the journals (according to specific specifications, for example trend handbags, coats, etc.).
Stylist and designer Mario Kameník told us about it.
But that only on Sunday.
This means that a stylist must have a good overall view.
The Saturday lecture, filled with information about figure types, was spiced up by three visitors from the industry:
by stylist Jan Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is illusion and that a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a stylist sent in can work with a single garment in very different ways.
The magic word is variability.
For example, you can wear a trench coat over jeans as usual, like a T-shirt or coat, but you can also wear it on your naked body, put on heels and wear it as a dress.
It is enough to roll up the sleeves or the collar and the whole look looks completely different.
"Play with it," he stressed.
But the following advice came in handy for me the most: "First you have to know the rules perfectly."
"Only then can you hurt her," said Jakub.
Finally I realize why we have to cramming all these doctrines, what can be combined with what and why, even if you often get to see completely different things in fashion journals.
Not to mention fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I now know that a stylist must have prepared many more clothing variants than he ultimately photographs.
So for a fashion story with ten pages (i.e. ten outfits) you have to be prepared to style at least fifteen.
And also that the clothing in the photo in combination with other accessories sometimes looks very different than in reality.
So you have to reckon with all this when designing the outfit.
Jan Pokorný also confirmed that image and style sometimes account for half of the success.
You only have to look at Madonna, a not exactly brilliant singer, from whom image and marketing have made a world star.
In the Czech Republic, the services of a stylist are rather reserved.
Even well-known personalities often consider this to be money thrown out (the main thing is that I bring something, how I look is secondary).
And if one of us can be styled, then we should expect that he or she will most likely force us a completely different (smaller) size than he or she really needs.
Then you only have to google to find out with certainty that the tabloid press writes that the corresponding celebrity has increased or decreased again, etc.
Jan and Mario advised us on Sunday not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on fashion and then "assemble" the outfit.
In his work, he must above all communicate with the people he styles and he must be a shrewd psychologist.
Assess people without currying favor and standing by one's opinion.
"If some manager orders us to sift through her wardrobe and add pretty pieces, we can't clear out the whole closet and say - my God, that's terrible."
"You have to find at least a few commendable things to recommend what you can wear to," says Mario.
He also showed us very concretely what such a so-called "place bag" must contain.
So a bag that you button up at the waist and in which you carry all the necessary proprieties with you.
In addition to such clear things as scissors, dispensers for hair removal or safety pins, it also contains such utensils as a nylon thread (so that the stylist helps himself when photographing products, such as handbags or hats), special clips with which the clothes are gathered at the back if they are too big (pins or other clamps are prohibited so that the fabric does not break) and of course sewing kit.
So that we not only have to listen, but also have to try something practical, we learned how to glue shoes properly.
Even when photographing in the studio, where the floor is level, you can damage the sole of your shoe, let alone the one outside.
Us o glued and glued we...
You can't even touch the shoes with scissors, so you don't damage them.
So you have to be really clever.
Mario delighted me by praising my "creation" without reservation.
The dexterity mentioned is not exactly my strength.
All this was only a fraction of what we heard during the second weekend continuation course.
One thing has become clear to me by now - dedicating yourself to styling at a professional level is not child's play.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal race across America
Review
A series of completely avoidable, amateurish mistakes turns the originally carefree journey into routine driving for the early shift.
It was possible to fulfil the ambitions to a large extent, but what good is that if obviously no one wanted to do a little more?
Even before it hit the counters, the new part with the subtitle "The Run" raised high expectations.
He promised to move the already old game series "Need for Speed" a bit into a new dimension and in the playable demonstration examples he actually seemed to be not only one of many action racing games.
We were also curious to see how the fitted passages turn out, in which the main protagonist gets out of the car and continues on foot.
But as you are used to with NFS, in the end a lot is different than you expected.
Sure - potentially they are quite decent arcade races, but overall the game is diminished by some superfluous bugs that have been present in this series more or less for a few years.
So these are actually no longer mistakes, but rather signs of a basically incomprehensible laziness of the game developers.
The adventure starts very well.
First you are introduced to the story, whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal character; the only solution seems to be to participate in an illegal race across America.
In San Francisco, on the West Coast, you get behind the wheel - with the task of being the first in New York.
The basic idea contains a whole series of interesting elements.
The entire route is divided into ten stages and more than fifty individual races.
This means that each race is held on a different track and that the individual stages take place in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
One does not have the impression for a moment that the game would offer the same thing over and over again.
Some environments are also very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics does not go beyond that of the earlier parts of the series.
So nothing earth-shattering.
But the drive through the desert, through autumnal landscape or high up through a snow-covered landscape is visually very pleasant.
Every now and then, atypical elements bring a little variety to the individual races.
In the desert, for example, you are surprised by a desert storm that severely restricts the view.
In the mountains, on the other hand, you have to be extremely careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
By the way, the individual races are installed quite well one after the other.
Only a few, but they are enough.
For a while you try to overtake the prescribed number of opponents (basically a classic race), then you have time to catch up (classic race against the stopwatch), then a personal duel with a single opponent awaits you.
And on top of that, the police get involved, who want to mess up the whole thing.
A novelty are passages in which Jack leaves the car.
It's more about certain interactive animations in which Jack flees from someone and where the player has to help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer such passages in the game than one would expect (specifically, probably only three).
Ultimately, this is rather to the advantage of the thing, because at least this element has no chance to get boring - in the context of the above, it is one of the elements that make the game more varied.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
That is, from today's point of view, it does not tear down trees, but on the other hand you could not say that it is bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulations, you have to look elsewhere.
But the local driving model continues to do justice to an action-packed racing quite well, although you could find better with the competition.
Until then, everything is fine.
Real problems only arise after a certain time.
In contrast to the driving model, the collision model is not quite OK.
It's hard to expect a game of this kind to calculate complicated deformations and collisions, but if you have virtually no idea how the car behaves before hitting any object, then obviously not everything is fine.
Typical example: When overtaking tightly or passing oncoming cars, you "touch" the other car only slightly in some places, but in other, almost identical situations you skid and do wild pirouettes.
Or drives the cart straight to scrap.
Thanks to the restart system, this does not matter, but it is always annoying.
The restarts are solved like this: if you have a total loss or land far off the track, then the game throws you back to the last clue of the track.
Only - in each race you only have five restarts.
When you have exhausted them, everything starts all over again.
The restarts are therefore more like a tool, in case something does not succeed, but you should not rely on it.
Sometimes, however, not even the restart helps, nothing else helps than to learn the critical section from the head.
It is extremely unpleasant that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, you have to drive through some corners in a very specific way, otherwise you just can't fit through.
Elsewhere, you always encounter "civilian" cars in the same configuration at the appropriate point, regardless of whether you arrive first or fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially annoying in situations when you see that the opponent in front of you passes two oncoming cars, but by the time you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive around them or brake.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, everything is designed so that this situation always comes close to your nose.
The counterparties have even more advantages.
Throughout the game there are a few places where you are always overtaken by the same opponent in the same place and again regardless of the timing.
This is craziest at the end of the game on the long bridge, which you pass in the opposite direction.
The opponent obviously has to overtake you here.
And if he is already in front of you, then of course he takes away your view, so that you drive your own car a few times in lumps at the beginning.
Sure - you just want to make the game more exciting and exciting, but this intention is so clear that it quickly spoils the joy of the game.
And that's a pity, because despite the simpler driving model, the game is quite entertaining overall and sometimes so action-packed that you almost don't know where your head is.
And in principle, it doesn't matter what is "to blame" - the concept with fifty unique routes, the arrangement of the races in such a way that boredom can not arise, or something completely different...
An unusual idea is also the car change in the course of the races.
You should not overlook the gas stations along the route, because just here you can change the car, although in most cases the car you have is sufficient.
The cars are divided into three categories.
The sports cars are well suited for urban areas, the powerful American limousines for the straight highways and exotic super sports cars for the technical drives, for example on the serpentines in the mountains.
Hand in hand with the mode of the game story also goes the task mode (challenges) - ie the races in the individual localities, which you know from the story.
Here you can win not only medals, but also experience points for your own profile, which is common for the tasks (challenges) and the history.
In order to get to the higher driver level, various objects have to be unlocked: from the car to the background for the profile.
This is also linked to the online Autolog function, which, among other things, compares your own results with those of other players and also provides other collective functions.
One of other incomprehensible blunders is a situation in the last race in history.
Here you come by car into a subway tunnel (because of me), where you race in the dark on the rails (because of me).
On the speedometer there are numbers between 150 a 200 km/h (because of me), but suddenly a subway comes from behind and drives you uncompromisingly to scrap.
In our editorial team, we will probably argue for a long time about whether this was a blackout of the game designers or whether the authors think we are so stupid.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the overall visual impression is quite appealing in most cases and even brilliant here and there.
It is all the more annoying that in some exciting moments the refresh rate slows down and sometimes quite dramatically.
However, this applies in particular to accidents with a larger number of participants, where continuous FPS is of no use anyway.
The sound reproduction is OK so far and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an effort to appeal to as broad a scale as possible to rather young audiences, a soundtrack a lá "something of everyone" was created - but who buys such a game because of the music?!
The overall impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are rather mixed.
If the game hadn't been diminished by the totally unnecessary bugs mentioned, we could have said with the chest tone of conviction that The Run is the best piece of NFS in recent years.
But that way the game seems kind of unfinished.
A great pleasure in itself, but you should be prepared for these mistakes to catch your eyes with the power of airport headlights.
Concert of the "Students of the Velvet Revolution" with vocal ensembles of Charles University
For the third time, the Festa Academica Festival offers the combination of World Student Day with the anniversary of the Velvet Revolution and this including a musical experience.
In the course of the festival, about twenty professional and university choirs will introduce themselves.
The focus of the festival is on the two concerts, which will take place on 17 November.
"Charles University played a major role in the festival."
"Among the participants is the choir of the Faculty of Education and the Faculty of Humanistic Studies, and the Rector Václav Hampl sits on the festival committee," said Jakub Čaloun, head of the organizing team.
The absolute highlight of the festival is the public concert of professional school choirs, which will take place on 17 November from 2 pm on the square in front of the National Technical Library in Dejvice.
On the program is the composition of the important Czech jazz musician Karel Růžička "Celebration Jazz Mass".
In the evenings, the concert "Students of the Velvet Revolution" (Studenty sametu) takes place in the gala rooms of the People's House in Vinohrady, at which university choirs also perform, choirs of Charles University not excluded.
Festa Academica aims not only to celebrate World Student Day and commemorate the 22nd anniversary of the Velvet Revolution, but also to present choral music to the public at the highest level and to promote creative collaboration among young people.
The main organizer is the Association of Czech Choirs in cooperation with the Johannes Kepler Gymnasium.
The entire event was sponsored by Bohuslav Svoboda, Mayor of the Capital City of Prague, and Václav Hampl, Rector of Charles University.
The festival will take place from 16 to 20 November in Prague and Pardubice.
In addition to festive concerts, the schedule also includes numerous music meetings, student happanings, matinees and other events.
Detailed information can be found on the website of the festival www.festaacademica.cz
EU Ambassador Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation as negativists and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has noticeably upset the balance between the individual institutions."
I didn't expect such a hard war to break out."
"It will take five or six years for the waves to calm down and everyone to get used to their new role," Milena Vicenová, the Czech ambassador to the European Union, began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
How seriously she takes the motto "Comprehensible and open about Europe" was already shown in the first part of her lecture, in which she succeeded in describing the individual institutions of the EU and their mutual relations in such a manageable and understandable way that many a lecturer at the Faculty of Law of Charles University could have envied her.
Ms Vicenová also praised the new permanent President of the Council of Europe, Herman Van Rompuy:
"Initially, there was criticism that he was too inconspicuous - a grey official who was not up to such a role, but I have to say it took everyone's breath away how well he took care of the matter.
"He is a person who manages to listen patiently to twenty-seven member states, to communicate with them and, above all, who has clear ideas about how to proceed with the EU.
She then explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy as an answer to the question: Who is this - the European Union? Which number should I call?", i.e. as an important step towards unification and better readability of EU policy towards countries such as China or India.
Nobody wants to forbid us our oil mouc tvargels
Mrs Vicenová also addressed the agenda according to which the European Union has lived, is living and intends to live in the near future.
She described the Czech Presidency two years ago as a success.
The Czechs had mastered the financial crisis and the gas crisis and also organised the Eastern Partnership Summit.
She described the fall of the government during the Presidency as a major negative event that had seriously damaged the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has its hands full.
In the words of the Ambassador, not only the Presidency but also the subsequent crisis, which has not yet been overcome, was quite hectic.
And then the EU's seven-year budget has to be approved, which makes things much more complicated, precisely because of today's economic situation.
Whether it will be a lean and frugal budget, which sectors of the economy will be given priority, which countries will receive more and which will receive less support - all this is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also recalls her own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Understandable about Europe".
"If there's something I don't like, it's greyish abbreviations, foreign words and jargon that nobody understands.
How am I, as a citizen, supposed to know whether Brussels is really coming up with crooked or round cucumbers and bananas of different sizes, or whether someone actually wants to ban us from using tvargel?
She would also have liked to use the soil of the EU to get more Czechs into European institutions.
Prospecting a two- or multi-speed Europe
According to the EU ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics, who perceive the negative rather than the positive sides of the matter.
All the more annoying is the weak representation of Czechs in European institutions.
Many factors are to blame for this, including the reluctance of our candidates, their inability to write motivation letters and, last but not least, the weak support of the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, she also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Group, the so-called V4.
"Believe me, when a Pole or Hungarian comes to me and a Slovak is nearby, the Frenchman next to me says: "Hey, what are you putting your heads together - is that your V4 again?"
According to Ms Vicenové, the EU expects tough rules for the budget policies of the member states in the future.
It sees the concept of a Europe of two or even different speeds as much more real than a "European federation".
"We have here the countries of the eurozone and the countries outside the eurozone.
"We have the Schengen area and we already have the Institute of Strengthened Cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only those countries that want it should work together and those that do not want it should stand quietly on the sidelines."
"There will be more and more such institutions, which will ultimately lead to a strong 'multi-speed Europe'," says Ms Vicenová.
In this regard, she also acknowledged the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in enforcing the principle that all issues affecting the EU as a whole must be discussed by all member states and not just by eurozone countries.
Brand Story:
The innovator IBM enters the second century of its existence
If you wanted to search for a suitable word that most accurately characterizes IBM's strategy, it would probably be the word "longevity".
For the general public, IBM is synonymous with technological revolution, known as a modern company, although a century has passed since its inception.
The foundation for this longevity was laid by its first boss - the visionary Thomas J. Watson sen.
He already advocated the slogan that countless global problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think a little.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the trademark around which the life of the future giant was to take place (and at the same time the title of the in-house magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
This was also the basis of Watsen's thoroughly prepared corporate culture.
"For us at IBM, this long-term thinking represents a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM survived and succeeded for a century because it stayed true to its principles and didn't shy away from changing everything else around it.
This allowed us, over the course of our first century, to transform technologies, business and society.
We hope to achieve even more in the next hundred years," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current director, on the occasion of the anniversary.
Well thought-out system
Watson already took social care of his employees in the thirties - in a similar way to the entrepreneur Baťa in Czechoslovakia: The IBM people were one of the first American employees to have paid holidays, insurance by the entrepreneur plus elegant uniforms as work clothes and a well thought-out remuneration system for the best innovators and traders.
IBM's long-term relationships with its customers are just as sophisticated.
The company was brilliant in talent development right from the start - IBM was one of the first companies in the world to lift all discrimination - and was able to choose accordingly.
In line with this anti-discrimination strategy is also the current plan that Palmisan will be replaced at the helm of IBM next year by a woman - Virginia Rometty.
She has been with IBM for thirty years, so far she has held the position of Head of Sales, Marketing and Strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been doing so-called online brainstorming sessions, from which many future strategies and innovations will grow.
No wonder - there are enough ideas, the company employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
Their unshakable position in the business guarantees the company a strong image both internally and externally.
"From the beginning, IBM had the concept of an institution rather than a mere technology company," said Harvard Business School professor and author of a book about IBM, Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technology company, it's a company that uses technology to solve business problems," added George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company itself points out, there is a difference between just being present in the market or shaping it directly through that presence.
IBM - called "Big Blue" in the states because of its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a century.
It is one of the most versatile technology companies out there – IBM develops hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in an incredible range of products - from servers to nanotechnology.
Of all American technology companies, IBM owns the most patents and five of its employees have already been awarded the Nobel Prize.
His best-known inventions include ATMs, credit cards, financial swaps, barcodes and the floppy disk.
With a market capitalization of approximately $220 billion, IBM was the second-largest technology company this year (right after Apple), overtaking Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all products and innovations met the taste of today's customers - unfortunate were, for example, the attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online service Prodigy or even the computers IBM PC jr.
"Business is based on forward movement, so you can't get emotionally attached to the past," says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM has no problem building its foundations on different platforms – and if they don't work, leaving them.
In contrast to the opponent Microsoft, which in principle stands and falls with its operating system Windows.
Promising technologies
Services account for the largest share of IBM's profits, with software and hardware each accounting for one-fifth.
In 1990, hardware was still the most strongly represented with a share of more than fifty percent.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-profit assets, but in the same time it has invested $58 billion in purchasing promising technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues even after 2008, when the modern financial crisis swept the world like a storm for the first time.
Again, IBM remained true to the legacy of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who increased his investment in the midst of the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is surviving today's crisis unscathed.
The value of IBM shares has skyrocketed by 120 percent since 2008, and the company's net profit is growing steadily.
IBM's corporate slogan is: everything can be changed - except the values.
This is another reason why it can be expected that this flexible giant will also master the next crisis.
IBM History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
Founded a hundred years ago in New York, IBM (International Business Machines) initially had a rather complicated name - Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It did not adopt the name IBM until 1924 - originally it was a brand name for a subsidiary in Canada and South America.
The foundation stone for the later company IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 80s of the 19th century.
They possessed technologies such as the famous time card clocks for registering the start and end of work.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also chaired the board of directors until 1930.
And it was Flint who hired the head of the competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
This leader then eclipsed even the founders of IBM - Watson's ideas are still the basis of the company's invincible culture and identity.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name suggests, began with the manufacture and distribution of all sorts of machines for the trade - from sausage and cheese cutters, to cash registers.
In the first four decades that Watson led the company, he doubled its sales to nine million dollars and the company gradually expanded to all continents.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he sat in the executive chair for forty years, only then was he replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his leadership, IBM began to work on the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programming language.
In the 60s, IBM technicians and computers helped NASA guide flights into space - to Mercury and Saturn and in 1969 also the famous flight of man to the moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which determined the computer standard of that time, came in 1981 under the name IBM 5150 on the market.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, but on the other hand it bought the consulting part of PricewaterhouseCoopers and thereby fully entered the business of consulting services and services with high added value.
The strategy that IBM has paid off over the last three years is the "Smarter Planet" concept.
It embodies the intention to use technologies wisely in areas not even planned before, e.g. to improve the situation in transport and city administration.
In the commerce sector, IBM recently launched the Smarter Commerce platform to help merchants manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong history in the Czech Republic.
As early as 1932, IBM founded a subsidiary in what was then Czechoslovakia - as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague and is also home to a top world-class research team working on voice recognition technology.
Darina Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta - you can keep this donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) says - now it's over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become her lover from the protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina still had the hope that Josef would wake up from his rose-colored dream and come home.
But now her patience is finally over and she has set clear rules for the rest of her life.
"Joseph can come home, but no more than my partner," explained D. Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová offered the singer I. Bartošová refuge in her own house, she would not even have dreamed of how her husband would turn out.
When Iveta left and returned to Říčany after 30 days at her insistence, Josef went with her.
He even publicly confessed that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, it even seemed as if she wanted to reconcile with her unfaithful husband - but now she finally gave him the pass.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with
If Rychtář leaves Iveta Bartošová in the future, he will certainly not receive open arms at home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams and if he wants to end his days in our common home, then I will not chase him out."
"However, not as a beloved, lost old donkey, but as a person with whom I still have certain ties," Mrs. Rychtářová revealed; but she also said that she had already emotionally separated from him and insisted solely on mutual decency.
The fact that Darina has locked the back door for him has so far been borne by Joseph with dignity.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'm staying with Iveta, that won't change."
"My wife wants a paper marriage and I respect that."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the land, I do the shopping."
"I talk to Darina quite normally, but we don't share the bed," said J. Rychtář (the paper) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn't want to stop her.
"We don't sleep together, so I don't care if she has a boyfriend or who she is.
I realize it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and that's why I take any responsibility.
The worst female vices: What about you?
If you ask men to name some typical female vices, they invariably shake some out of their sleeves.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, in which we review a few bad habits that make the blood flow in the veins of men?
Shopping addiction
Does her husband accuse her of being addicted to shopping?
Do you need to buy at least one Hader a week?
Do you like to go shopping and would you like a little more when it comes to promotions?
Then in your case it is probably really about a weakness.
Some women are at least aware of this and try to keep their desire to shop halfway under control.
But hand on heart, what woman can stand to stroll through a clothing store in search of a well-fitting outerwear and not try out all of them (in all possible color combinations) in the cabin?
Even though shopping is a hobby for most women, for men it is often pure hell.
Think about how many times you have told your husband - you better stay outside...
Constant dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I would have to lose at least five kilos - should I start jogging or doing gymnastics?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Does this sound familiar to you?
Yes?
Then you are probably one of those women who are obsessed with how they look.
This does not mean that you should let yourself go, but many men are allergic to it when their wife constantly complains about her appearance.
The stronger sex agrees - with increasing frequency of complaints, women are more and more incompatible.
Order and cleanliness first
It is a battle against windmills.
Clean windows, wipe tiles and dust, scrub the tub - at least twice a week.
Do you scold your partner because he tramples on the clean tiles with dirty shoes again, scold the children because the sink that has just been scrubbed is dirty again and because the glass door on the living room cabinet has fingerprints again, when polishing is so much trouble?
If you suffer from this kind of "deviance", then you should know that one should not exaggerate anything and that order and cleanliness do not come first in family life.
This excessive purity frenzy can ultimately damage mutual relationships and, above all, peace in the family.
Tease
"Dirty gym pants go in the laundry basket."
"Do you really want to put those old socks back on tomorrow?"
"You don't just throw a wet towel on the floor."
If your partner is exposed to such a tirade, you should not be surprised that it makes him angry.
Of course, that's not bad, they just want everything to be in order.
If the men knew this, then the women might not need to complain so much.
Gossip
Some women like to gossip and gossip, whispering or even slandering behind their backs or making alliances.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to rush through such topics as - who, where, with whom, how and why.
Probably every one of us women has a bit of harmless gossip in store.
Hand on heart - this is probably characteristic of all women.
But this is not to be confused with gossipers of the crudest caliber, to whom nothing and no one is sacred, who probably despise everyone around them and who pose a considerable danger, especially for women's collectives.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia win with their assistants
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr played a major role in Philadelphia's 5-3 victory on the ice in Carolina at Monday's NHL game with two assistants, making him the most prolific Czech player in the NHL.
The beneficiary of the thirty-nine-year-old hockey star's overview in both cases was Claude Giroux, who added an assistant and was named the best player of the match.
Jágr's teammate Jakub Voráček also recorded two assistants in the same game.
Jágr told journalists after the game that he had prophesied a great evening for Giroux.
"Even before the game, I tell him he'll get a hat-trick today."
I kind of felt that."
"Every now and then you get that kind of feeling," said Jágr, after whose action Giroux scored on the Flyers' first shot.
A little later, the second goal also had "a Czech trace".
Voráček fought for the puck behind the Hurricanes' goal and put it in front of Maxim Talbot between circles.
A second before the final whistle of the first third, home player Patrick Dwyer scored a short-hander, but the second third belonged to the Flyers again.
Specifically, Giroux.
In collaboration with Jágr he scored his third goal, then Wayne Simmonds directed his shot for the fourth goal.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but I'm sure he's in the top three," Jágr said.
"It would never have occurred to me in my life that at the end of my career I would play with such an ice hockey player as with him."
"I'm really happy about that."
"I tailor my game to myself."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates set their game on me and now the tables are turning," Jágr smiled.
Carolina turned the game into a drama - through the goals of Tuoma Ruutua and once again Dwyer, who prevailed from a penalty shot, it came close to a goal.
Matt Read prevented any further complication by being outnumbered two against one.
"Pronger performed excellently in our zone."
"He caught the puck, I picked up speed and (Read) moved to more distant posts."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voráček described the last goal of the game from his point of view.
This victory placed Philadelphia at the head of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček was injured in the match against Buffalo and retired in the second third due to an upper body injury.
In addition to their experienced Beck, the Candiens also lost their lead in the penalty shootout 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec failed to convert one of the penalty shots.
More than the lost points, the coach of the home team probably hurt the high illness-related absence in the defense - they played the game with only five defenders to the end.
"That's bad."
"We only finished the match with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But nothing can be done about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"With every change, one wave of attacks after another and we had nothing to oppose."
"We should have made the game easier and put the puck out of our third."
There were still reserves here," said P. K. Subban, one of the defenders.
Czech goaltender Ondřej Pavelec blocked thirty shots from Tampa Bay and contributed significantly to the 5-2 victory over Winnipeg.
The Jets' goals, which ended a five-loss streak, were scored by five different shooters.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Until 1989 there were only five approved state travel agencies in the then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
At that time, the travel agencies mainly sold trips to the socialist Eastern Bloc countries, at that time only select people were allowed to go to the West.
And so Czech tourists traveled to the Baltic Sea (to the German Democratic Republic - the GDR), to the Soviet Union (Sochi on the Crimean peninsula on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria and Romania to the Black Sea and to Hungary to Lake Balaton.
A slight exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when one was also allowed to travel to Yugoslavia, then Yugoslavia took a pro-Western course and therefore travel to Yugoslavia was severely restricted.
A great paradox of those socialist times was that not even citizens of the Eastern Bloc (including Czechoslovakians) were allowed to travel freely within the framework of the socialist countries.
If, for example, a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, then he needed a so-called invitation letter, otherwise individual trips were not possible.
Even then, the travel agencies also offered trips to the West, but then you had to accept huge queues or sleep in a sleeping bag in front of the travel agency, or at least have "good acquaintances" in the travel agency.
Even so, things had not gone for a long time.
The so-called foreign exchange promise - the condition for leaving for the West - was only granted to "politically reliable" people - the others were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely exchangeable currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it would have been impossible to raise the necessary funds (Western currency) for a trip to the West.
The most Czechs spent their holidays inland, no wonder that the Czechs bought countless weekend houses and dachas - a habit that continues to this day.
The Velvet Revolution of 1989 was followed by a travel revolution by the Czechs.
While until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or in Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czechs spent 4.5 million of their holidays abroad in countries all over the world last year.
A huge paradox, of which one is no longer aware today, is the fact that one could not travel to the currently most popular holiday destination of the Czechs - Croatia - until 1989, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the beginning of the 90s of the last century, the foreign exchange obligation to the neighboring Western European countries was abolished, which caused a huge wave of short visits, especially to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
For a long time, Czechoslovakians simply could not get enough of their trips to the West, everyone wanted to have been there for at least a few days.
So the Czech tourists slept on trips to Paris in a tent in the park, because who would have had the money for accommodation in a hotel or in a guesthouse at that time.
A typical feature of trips abroad by Czechs at that time was a trunk packed with canned food, beer and sausage, etc.
Another important milestone was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech koruna - after decades, our tourists were finally able to buy the Western currency freely.
Our standard of living and, as a result, average salaries increased, which in 1997 led to another important moment.
Thanks to the increased demand for travel, after 1997 travel agencies began to regularly prepare trips through charter flights, which made air travel incredibly cheaper compared to the past thanks to the possibility of negotiating volume discounts.
At the end of the 90s, the Czechs, with the exception of the USA, already had non-currency payments with all the highly developed countries of the world, which made travel even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of "post-velvet" travel occurred in 2000, when, thanks to high demand, the first direct charter flight to an exotic country was handled - Thailand.
Since then, direct charter aircraft with Czech passengers have been flying to distant sunny countries every year; This year, twelve exotic destinations will be served directly from the Czech Republic.
Around 100 thousand Czechs travel to exotic countries every year!
Another significant moment in the epoch that marked our "post-revolutionary" development came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States lifted visa requirements for Czech tourists, which definitely placed our country among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad for the first time (50.3%) and for the first time in their history they spent more than CZK 15 thousand per capita on a single holiday stay, including costs at the resort.
The Annual General Meeting is to find a new chairman - again a stalemate threatens.
Czech football has not had a chairman for almost five months and there is a threat that Ivan Hašek's successor at the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR) will not be known even after the extraordinary general meeting in Nymburk on Thursday.
To date, there has been no agreement on the electoral rules according to which elections should be held.
And without this, no vote on the three potential successors is possible at all.
Three interested parties want to manage Czech football - Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June, Hašek stepped down from his position, calling on his colleagues to come to an agreement and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
Only - in the era after Hašek, the old quarrels broke out again between the two chambers of the association, which could not agree on a common candidate.
This was clearly demonstrated on 16 September, when the new chairman was to be chosen.
The delegates of the General Assembly had come to the People's House in Prague's Smíchov district for nothing, because the negotiations did not lead to any result and it was not only about the election itself.
It was not even possible to agree on who was actually entitled to vote in the full collection - only the statutory representatives or also the functionaries with a power of attorney.
At least partial agreement was reached on this single point, which was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, which considered that representation on the basis of power of attorney was not permissible.
However, disputes over electoral regulations continue.
Even the Executive Committee did not bring more clarity to the matter, at whose meetings - whether ordinary or extraordinary - in principle nothing else is on the agenda.
Even if the views regarding the election changed a few times, the neuralgic point remained the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to avoid a stalemate?
"The point of contention concerns the question of whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes, or whether a completely different model must be found," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice-chairmen of FAČR, who represents professional football in management.
According to the statutory model, the winner in the third round is the candidate who receives the greater percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Moravia is reportedly willing to accept the compromise that the candidate who receives the higher number of votes from both chambers wins.
The Czech side, on the other hand, insists on the condition that the winner receives at least a two-thirds majority in this percentage vote count.
"Then the two preliminary rounds no longer make any sense, this mode would call into question the entire bicameral concept," Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, which would find it best not to bend the electoral regulations, but to vote according to the current statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomáš Paclík agrees, even if it becomes apparent that the statutory electoral rules of all candidates are most likely to suit Pelta.
"My wish is that elections will be held as far as possible according to the statutes."
"So that no nonsensical replacement variants are invented, as at the last general meeting," said the owner (of the football club) Victoria Plzeň, who is running for the first time and distinguished himself in his statements especially from Pelta.
But Pelta remains optimistic.
In his opinion, the new chairman will be known in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates will also cooperate constructively in the future.
"The possible qualification of the national team for the European Football Championship today would certainly help to calm the minds."
"If football is riding the euphoric wave, then the willingness to cooperate is greater," says the official from Jablonec, who has the most experience of all three adepts, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is more reserved.
"I hope for an agreement, but the situation is unfortunately ambivalent."
"This is not a matter between people from Bohemia and Moravia, but there are certain efforts to 'bend' the regulations for their own purposes."
"Therefore, a renewed blocking at the Annual General Meeting is not excluded."
"However, I hope that common sense ultimately prevails," Rajchl said.
Only - there is not much time left for all sides to agree.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will even be complete by the time of the qualifying match.
The charter plane, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl, among others, were to fly to Podgorice, could not take off in Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction and so they feverishly searched for a replacement variant to bring part of the Executive Committee to the venue of the Barrage first leg.
In the end, the meeting at ministerial level, which is supposed to take place on Wednesday, is decisive.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Physical Education, would have liked to persuade the divided parties within the country's largest sports federation to reach an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the trustworthiness of Czech football and also the upcoming general meeting of the ČSTV, which is intended to show Czech sport the new direction after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclík goes into battle for the position of chairman because he does not see a suitable candidate
If Tomáš Paclík, the head of the Pilsen footballers, had been able to identify a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have fulfilled all his ideas about the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have entered into the fight for this top position at all.
"If there was a good contender, I would fight for him and renounce the election."
"But in the current situation, it was not possible to find such an adept," said Paclík ČTK.
The main reason for Paclík to go into a duel with Miroslav Pelta and Jindřich Rajchl is therefore to prevent the alleged favorite of the election, Pelta, from reaching the top of the FAČR.
Paclík also emphasizes that in the event of his victory, he intends to exercise the function of Chairman for only one year, i.e. until 2013, until the date of the Annual General Meeting.
In the position of chairman, he would have liked to see an experienced top manager who is not too involved in football.
"I've spoken personally to some of the people in question."
"It's hard to believe that some people told me they didn't want to identify with Czech football at the moment.
"Such views would have liked to change," he said.
Most of all, Paclík is said to be bothered by Pelta's association with the chairman of the Pilsen District Football Association, Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial reputation who is considered a powerful lobbyist behind the scenes, with the ability to influence delegate votes at general meetings.
For Paclík, it is therefore unacceptable that Pelta would hold the position of chairman.
"If he wins, the current situation would be preserved and Czech football would not progress at all."
"The support of Berbr, a clever businessman, would be doubly bad for football," Paclík stressed.
He also alludes to the fact that Pelta's name was mentioned some time ago in connection with telephone tapping to investigate a corruption affair, from which Pelta emerged with impunity.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelta victory would bring to (Czech) football."
"And how would we look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," said řekl Paclík, who is a little more relaxed about his earlier statement that "he will sell the Pilsen football club if Pelta becomes chairman".
Should Paclík win in Thursday's election, however, he could imagine a future cooperation with Pelta.
Another candidate thinks the same way - Rajchl, whom Paclík had supported before the general meeting in October, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would go to."
"He has great abilities."
"I could well imagine him as head of the national team, for example."
"But I don't think he's capable of leading the association as a manager."
"I don't stick my nose into matters I don't understand about," said Paclík, who caused a stir in September by being behind the dismissal of the referees commission headed by Luďěk Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damková.
Paclík himself claims that he feels up to the role of association chairman.
Since last summer, he has also been head of Pilsen, which celebrated its first triumph in the league with his support in May.
"I have the power to change something in the football milieu and contribute to a certain cultivation of it."
"In order to limit the influence of certain interest groups that tend to influence disciplinary and appeal committees, which degenerates into repugnant situations," said Paclík, who makes no secret of his antipathy towards Sparta boss Daniel Křetínský, for example.
One of his priorities is to strengthen relations between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders for more money from the lottery tax to flow into sport.
"This is one of the crucial things that the new chairman should dedicate himself to."
"When it comes to the taxation of gambling, as the political parties declare, then I understand their reasoning, but then they must also say clearly where the money goes," he said.
Paclík also does not see his connection to the Pilsen club as a handicap, although he himself stresses that the chairman of the FAČR must be "non-partisan".
Pelta, in turn, is connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with the Prague Dukla.
"That's not ideal."
"In my opinion, however, it does not make much sense to hypocritically transfer my shares in the Pilsen club to a third person and to return after a year and a half," Paclík clarified.
Pelta promised new statutes of the FAČR, which would rule out a stalemate situation in the future.
Two days before the general meeting of the Football Association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship, Miroslav Pelta, promised that, if elected, he would campaign for the FAČR to get new statutes that would rule out disputes over the electoral regulations from the outset in the future.
The official from Jablonec is confident ahead of Thursday's hearing in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will certainly defuse itself if the Czech selection is successful.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealized election in September that he would concentrate on the national team and the acquisition of funds if elected.
He decided only at the last moment to participate in the election before the last general meeting and so the two-month break may help him to defend his ideas about the management of football and to present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels are dedicated to football, they are impatient and therefore expect the chairman to be known on Thursday."
"He feels that it is high time that the federation is led by someone, says the man, who is mainly associated with the Jablonec club, but who also worked for many years at Sparta and on the executive committee.
This is another reason why he believes that he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are due to the euphoria that prevailed in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, at the Annual General Meeting in June, articles of association were approved that were not as perfect as everyone had assumed.
If they hadn't allowed different interpretations, we would have had a chairman from September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the revision of the most important document of the civic association that he used as a lure for the delegates.
"If I become chairman, then I take care of it personally and am prepared to take personal responsibility if it does not work out."
"This is a matter of principle that he cannot be without," Pelta claims.
Furthermore, he does not try to distance himself from his opponents.
He had previously announced that he could imagine working with Jindřich Rajchl, whom he recognizes for his legal education, and he knows well that his opponent would be his first deputy.
He also did not attack Tomáš Paclík for a long time, who in turn did not leave a dry thread on Pelta.
He has been active in football for over a year and can already point to certain successes."
"However, his attacks were disparaging and many people were shocked by his campaign."
"This is another reason why many now doubt his real character," Pelta addressed his opponent, who would probably remain true to his proclamations, which he had already expressed in September.
In his opinion, his strongest weapon is the knowledge of football from the lowest divisions, up to the national team.
And this should be the figurehead of Czech football.
"I would also strive to end all affairs - from the Bohemian case to the reverberations of last year's corruption scandal."
"Right after that, I would rush into negotiations with the private and state sectors to ensure sufficient funding for all football," forty-six-year-old candidate ČTK said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his entry into the top of Czech football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would first have to familiarize myself with the work content of all employees," he said in the direction of Strahov, where there is understandably nervousness due to the long anarchy.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios surrounding the upcoming Annual General Meeting, he believes that the delegates will not travel to Nymburk on Thursday for nothing.
"If really the only point of contention is how to vote in the third round, then we'll get over it."
"Football needs credibility and it only regains it when it finally has a new leader," Pelta remains optimistic two days before the potentially decisive day of his career as an official.
Rajchl promises that the FAČR will start working hard under him
If the former deputy chairman Jindřich Rajchl were to be elected as the new chairman of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the general meeting on Thursday, this would allegedly spoil the mood of many people in the association.
Rajchl promises that if elected, they will start working hard.
He wants to introduce system changes and make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve Bohemian's case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money into football and otherwise continue the work started by the previous chairman Ivan Hašek.
"As chairman, I want to dedicate myself to football as a whole."
From international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, through the national selection, professional football, to competitive football for young people."
"I'm not saying that I want to do everything on my own," Rajchl told ČTK.
"I am a team player and would therefore like to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee in such a way that each member devotes himself to a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that football progresses with mileage steps in every segment."
Many would not be delighted about this, because instead of just criticising the work of others, she would now have to start working really hard herself," he added.
Because of the critical atmosphere in the football movement, I considered not running at all.
"I am known to work 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that there are people behind me who don't constantly throw sticks between my legs and question every step I take," he said, explaining why he hesitated.
"But a lot of people told me not to give up, because otherwise others would do the same."
"This is trust that must not be squandered," he said.
Allegedly, he is also motivated to be allowed to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we've done a lot of work and I don't want to throw that away."
"Processes have been started that will probably only come into effect in a few years and I would be reluctant to see anyone stop them," he said, expressing his concern that if the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta - were elected, the situation could return to the days before Hašek.
"I believe in a systematic approach and that's something Mirek Pelta doesn't do."
"Behind him are mainly people who would make football in such a way that it would only be there for the chosen ones."
You can accuse me of some things, but not that I'm biased."
"I try to be objective."
"I want football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine, not just the chosen one," Rajchl remarked.
He also contradicts the claim that he is only a chairman of the Czechs.
"Even if some people say the opposite, I really intend to do the best I can for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to consider whether the league should not be divided into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which will then be promoted to the first league."
"Then it could not happen that today only three Moravian clubs play in the league, which is a problem especially for the young players in Moravia," says Rajchl.
Because the head of the Pilsen club, Tomáš Paclík, has now joined the fight for the position of chairman, Rajchl does not dare to assess his chances that he will be elected.
"I feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its deputy chairman and now recognizes that clear successes are behind me," said Rajchl, who also sees the saving of tens of millions of crowns for unfavorable contracts, the agreement of television contracts and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, he partly blames himself for the fact that the association does not pull in the same direction.
While he says of Pelta that "he is disqualified from the outset to restore confidence in Czech football", he considers his second rival - Paclík to be a strong candidate who really has something to offer football.
"No one can question that he has done an excellent job in Pilsen in just one year."
"If elected, he would probably continue the things that Ivan Hašek has initiated and he would obviously not fundamentally change the staffing in the commissions."
He certainly wouldn't want to turn things in his favour," says Rajchl about his rival.
Europe's most beautiful pools
Jump into the blue
By Julia Stanek
Paddling pool in UFO look, state pools in Budapest: If you travel through Europe, you can experience its blue wonder - and after a city tour or a hike, rest your tired legs in bubble baths.
A book shows where wellness in the water is most beautiful.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip over the past year and a half, one thing could not be missing in her luggage: her swimsuit.
Lying backwards on the water, she looked up into elaborately designed domes, swam towards marble putti waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at meticulously restored Art Nouveau swimming pools.
If she liked a bath, she quickly added it to her notebook - including interesting details about the construction and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 swimming pools in this way - and now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden": public swimming pools in Munich, historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, "hardcore concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Her "journey to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true bathing culture enthusiast.
She doesn't have much to do with sports, says Meder – only in the water it's different.
It's just annoying that swimming fans have to put up with blue tiles and chlorine stench, while joggers can breathe in the beguiling scent of spruce forests or listen to cheerful birdsong in the park.
"One day I asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so ugly," says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful baths."
Water surface doubles architecture
Splashing in the diving pool and essential sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builders have made an effort, swimming pools can be a real feast for the eyes: "Instead of a floor, you have a water surface in baths."
"On the one hand, it is transparent, but on the other hand, it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything doubles visually: high vaults, colorful tiles, diving boards.
The small-format illustrated book "Badefreuden" conveys interesting facts about the architectural and cultural history of historical wellness oases on 190 pages - but above all makes you want to jump into the blue.
The pool collector Meder discovered remarkable specimens during her research in Hungary.
In addition to magnificent spas such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, she found nitrate-rich waters in a quaint karst cave (cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and a thermal bath whose pools are filled with alkaline water and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
On the other hand, many heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While you can see the whole city from the Zurich rooftop pool, you can look out over the snow-covered Arlberg in the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton - and: In the steam bath there is a window from which you can watch the hustle and bustle on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary pool design awaits bathers in Längenfeld: The Aquadome Ötztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, it steams from three bowls open to the top, while in the background the mountains of the Ötztal rise into the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool, the smell of chlorine rose into the nose of the pool collector Meder.
Many thermal baths smell of sulphur, in the Árpád bath in Békescsaba, Hungary, it stinks so much of heating oil that you hardly believe you have landed in a health bath.
The smell comes from the alkali-hydrogen carbonate-containing healing water, which is almost black and whose silt sticks to your skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a special kind.
In one place, however, Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for beautiful bathing areas: When she wanted to visit the outdoor and sunbathing in the Czech bath Luhatschowitz, she found a cordoned-off terrain.
The bath, designed in 1902 by architect Dušan Jurkovic, has since been closed.
When Meder took a look through the weathered windows of the red, white and yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
On the other hand, the decay was counteracted in an enchanting swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
This bath has already completed three construction phases; You can discover not only neo-Romanesque elements dating back to the time of its construction in 1844, but also a Moorish hall in the Alhambra style, added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been the favorite bath of pool expert Iris Meder - and not only because she originally comes from the Black Forest.
"It's quite an achievement to merge such different architectural styles into such a great unit," says Meder.
With such a palace, the dive in the thermal pool is apparently only a minor matter.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank sheds light on commodities business
By Christian Teevs
Is Deutsche Bank going out of its agricultural commodities business?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the world's poor.
In January, the CEO wants to draw consequences.
Hamburg-
For German citizens, the matter is clear: According to a study, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural commodities such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions get out of this business because it exacerbates the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organisation Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, the author Harald Schumann shows that the bets on the global commodity exchanges drive up prices - and the banks are therefore partly to blame for the worldwide hunger problem.
The campaign of the consumer advocates is specifically directed against Deutsche Bank boss Josef Ackermann, even if major banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act similarly.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to hedge traders against price fluctuations.
But now most experts agree that the gamblers have decoupled from supply and demand - and make profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike U.S. competitors, Ackermann responded to the criticism, promising to investigate the allegations and saying no deal was "worth risking Deutsche Bank's reputation."
According to information from SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently examining the allegations from the Foodwatch report.
The audit is expected to be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's Management Board - including a recommendation on how to deal with them.
At the end of January, the top of the bank wants to announce what consequences it draws.
The end result could be a reduction in the raw materials business, or even a complete abandonment.
Ackermann tinkers with his image
Foodwatch boss Thilo Bode welcomed the news, but at the same time reiterated his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how ruthlessly banks are harming the common good today."
As the top bank lobbyist, Ackermann is now particularly responsible.
"Deutsche Bank must remove from its portfolio all investments where money is used to bet on food prices," Bode said.
"No matter whether Mr. Ackermann is concerned with people suffering from hunger or the reputation of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann's insight comes as a surprise at first glance, but it is clear that the CEO wants to give a perfect picture a few months before leaving office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that, unlike planned, the CEO will not move to the supervisory board.
By turning away from controversial agricultural speculation, he could improve his image.
And he hardly needs to worry about possible losses - after all, his successor would have to do with that.
One in two would cancel commodity investments
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internet users have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey, for which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only eleven percent consider it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that bet on prices for food.
Many bank customers would also draw personal consequences if they learned that their bank participates in such transactions: According to the survey, one in two would cancel all investments in which money flows into commodity speculation.
43 percent would advise acquaintances against such a bank, 49 percent said they were thinking about terminating their account and switching to another institution.
21er Haus in Vienna
The relocated pavilion
By Ingeborg Wiensowski
An architectural history with highs, lows and happy endings: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavilion in Brussels in 1958 won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, stood empty and fell into disrepair.
Now it is being reopened as an exhibition venue.
If people rave about modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion by architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World Exhibition in 1958 is a striking and famous example.
At the time, Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its light and floating steel-glass construction.
The building is still regarded as a milestone in contemporary architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built pavilions at Austria's next World Exhibition.
With its legendary BMW four-cylinder house plus bowl-like annex in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
His pavilion, planned as a temporary exhibition building, was set up after the World Exhibition in the Swiss Garden near Vienna's Südbahnhof, rebuilt and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century was opened in it - it was called the "20er Haus".
However, the building was neither spatially nor technically suitable as a museum - no walls for hanging art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art got a new house in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building stood empty and came down more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has rebuilt the pavilion, it is now called "21er Haus" and will be used as a museum for contemporary art in the future.
On Tuesday evening, the Museum Belvedere, to which the museum belongs, opens its first exhibition there - a stroke of luck in every respect.
The new beginning was achieved by Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Gallery Belvedere in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, who holds a doctorate in art history with a remarkable career, including in her youth as a figure skater, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as founding director of the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, emphatically pushed through the conversion with politicians and preservationists, she procured public funds and private sponsorship money and determined its use.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba were to be exhibited by the foundation of the same name, there was to be a café and a bookshop, and an office building had to be built.
Strict supervision, small budget
Krischanitz was the ideal choice for the implementation.
Not only because he had sensitively rebuilt and expanded Joseph Olbrich's Secession in Vienna and won the competition, but because he studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology and the pavilion was a "tremendously important place" for him, where he had seen the exhibitions "almost every weekend".
He knew the original design, and he knew the problems of the building, which already lost its generosity and lightness when it was transferred to Vienna and converted.
There were far bigger problems with the current conversion: The building was "an energy guzzler," says Krischanitz.
The window profiles of the glass façade were replaced, glass-fibre-reinforced insulating glass was used and the glass roof was replaced by special safety glass.
Cold bridge steel girders have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been renovated.
Two basements provided space for the new use, a lowered light trench between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still the light Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors have remained, the house is painted in the old reddish-brown rust protection color.
And the cinema hall is even exactly as it used to be.
And all this under the strict supervision of the monument authority and with a small budget.
"Often a material had to be found that is good and cheap and also appealed to the monument protection office," says Krischanitz and points to a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the constraints, problems and conversions, the building has remained flexible and light.
It was difficult with the pavilion, "which came from Brussels," Krischanitz recently said, a typical "drop-in-the-city story."
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and still wants to "awaken a real awareness".
In this case, however, the 21er Haus is not in the wrong place, because an urban planning stroke of luck has occurred: Around the Swiss Garden, the completely newly planned "Hauptbahnhofsquartier", with office and residential buildings, is currently being built.
And another stroke of luck may still occur: The 21er Haus could be strengthened by another Krischanitz building, because the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin Temporäre Kunsthalle, and as one hears, she is already negotiating with the city for a neighborly location in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans winter crisis package worth millions
Deutsche Bahn has devised a crisis plan to prevent train cancellations in winter.
The number of employees is to be doubled.
That costs millions.
In the fight against winter-related train cancellations and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending an additional 70 million euros this year, according to a newspaper report.
The "Bild" newspaper reported in advance, citing an internal crisis plan, that investments totaling around 300 million euros were planned by 2015.
The aim is to improve the availability of vehicles and the rail network, even in extreme weather conditions.
Among other things, it is planned to double the number of internal and external employees for snow removal on railway facilities and platforms to 16,000 people.
The aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice within four to five hours by the start of operations and 90 percent of the points required for operation.
Two months ago, Deutsche Bahn CEO Rüdiger Grube warned of train cancellations and delays this winter after a top meeting with government and industry.
Last winter, the railway had considerable problems in passenger traffic, as it lacks reserves, among other things in difficult weather conditions.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
For years, Deutsche Bahn has also had to have axles of ICE trains tested much more frequently in the workshop after an ICE train had an axle break at Cologne Central Station.
Deutsche Bank pays millions in fine in the US
After the turmoil surrounding boss Josef Ackermann, new adversity comes from the USA: Deutsche Bank has to pay a fine of millions.
As if the problems at home were not enough for Deutsche Bank, the industry giant is now catching up with its past in the US: The Frankfurt institute pays 145 million dollars (106 million euros) in a settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
It is about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial market regulator NCUA accuses a whole series of major banks of having tricked the cooperative banks into buying financial products with false promises; they would have downplayed the risks.
Such securities lost a lot of value during the financial crisis and dragged the banks down with them.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without the parties having to go to court," said a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York.
The bank did not admit any guilt with the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which committed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA Chairwoman Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US credit unions and steps in in the event of bankruptcies to protect customer deposits.
The NCUA is trying to get the billions of dollars in damage compensated.
The settlements now concluded are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also taken on other major banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
The mortgage securities in question are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, this was the downfall of a large number of financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers tipped over.
Even though the events took place several years ago, a sharp wind is currently blowing against the banks in the USA.
Investors and regulators have filed countless lawsuits seeking redress or misconduct.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has triggered the largest wave of lawsuits.
It accuses 18 major international banks of having taken advantage of the two state-owned US real estate financiers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in mortgage transactions with a volume of around 200 billion dollars.
Deutsche Bank also has to face a lawsuit by the FHFA, which involves several deals worth a total of $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority demands that the Frankfurters are responsible for "substantial losses", but without naming an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank had rejected the demands as baseless and declared that it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with 10 billion
Financial guru Buffett invests heavily in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the large American investor Warren Buffett had always declared that he would not invest in IT and computer companies, as the long-term development of the companies was difficult to predict.
Now, however, he has read IBM's annual reports and changed his mind about investments in the industry.
He had to understand much earlier that IBM mainly offers services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
An investment by Warren Buffett is considered an accolade in the financial world.
As a result, the IT veteran IBM can now call itself "Sir IBM".
Because Buffett revealed now in the US business channel CNBC that he had bought IBM shares worth $ 10.7 billion since March.
His investment holding Berkshire Hathaway has thus become one of IBM's largest shareholders with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said that not even IBM had known about the involvement.
He praised the management, which had ensured decent profits even during the economic crisis.
"They did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been relying on lucrative IT services such as the operation of data centers for some time.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful company computers.
Buffett had avoided technology companies until then.
He says he only invests in companies whose business he understands.
Instead, Buffett took advantage of a freight railroad, a lubricant manufacturer or mechanical engineer.
In addition to around 80 of its own subsidiaries, his holding company Berkshire Hathaway also owns shares in a whole series of large corporations such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re, the former Munich Re.
The 81-year-old had taken over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and developed it into one of the most valuable companies in the world with clever investments.
Nevertheless, his lifestyle is modest.
He is therefore a cult figure for countless investors all over the world.
His almost unerring sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha."
After the announcement of the Buffett investment, IBM shares rose by one percent in the pre-market period.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, is worth more than 220 billion dollars on the stock market, making it one of the most valuable technology companies in the world together with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, Buffett said, he did not want to get involved.
Founder Bill Gates is a close friend.
The threat is tangible
After the discovery of the "Zwickau cell", Turkish media doubt the German rule of law.
One newspaper even speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is now reviving.
The murders of eight Turkish-born and one Greek small business owner between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
This news is being reacted to with fear and concern in Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany.
For many German-Turks, a ghost long believed dead is returning: Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background against Turks.
Nevertheless, the fact that there is xenophobia in Germany was never in question.
However, the uncovered right-wing extremist network reveals dimensions whose dimensions are far from foreseeable.
"Is the bloody ideology revived?" headlined the Internet edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah", on the other hand, emphasizes that one of the perpetrators was an undercover agent of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution, and is concerned that German authorities could also be involved in the right-wing swamp.
The Turkish Community of Germany reacted calmly: it remembered the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate at the weekend.
Only two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the german-Turkish recruitment agreement in a ceremony.
The togetherness was staged in cheerful colours - as a story of success.
The reporting of some Turkish media seems like a slap in the face: "Germany's gift for the fiftieth" is the headline of an article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the series of murders.
Even the German edition of "Hürriyet" does not miss the opportunity to draw this mental connection.
"It starts to stink" is the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
He emphasizes that people who paid taxes and made an important contribution to the reconstruction of Germany with their work were murdered.
In German-Turkish Internet forums, the actions of the police and their subsequent search success are discussed extremely critically.
The authors wonder why it did not occur to the German authorities much earlier to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles.
Some are at least rhetorically prepared to take drastic measures: "If sloppiness continues here, migrants have no choice but to defend themselves and arm themselves."
"That will probably be the best self-protection."
"The inner peace in Germany depends very much on the quality of the enlightenment and the appropriateness of the punishment of the entire network," writes "Selen".
What it means when internal peace in Germany is in danger was illustrated by the attacks in Mölln and Solingen in the nineties.
The photo of the fire ruins of Solingen is deeply rooted in German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event showed the Turks living here more clearly that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks sharpened the sense of togetherness on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
At the time, the Turkish press criticized the failure of German politics after the attacks: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the arson attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president, but was represented at the funeral service in Cologne by his Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel listed in his speech how many taxes the local Turks paid.
Just as if the value of a person were calculated according to the amount of his tax levies.
The current reporting of the Turkish media shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks in the local rule of law has been since then.
In addition to the efforts to comprehensively investigate and reassess right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time we need open words.
The scandalous bank of Lake Zurich
The most adventurous bank in Europe is not located in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been sliding from one crisis to the next ever since.
Now a German is to judge it.
Axel Weber certainly didn't think so.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the Bundesbank, it was announced in July that he would take up an almost equally spectacular new job in 2013: Chairman of the Board of Directors of the major Swiss bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Axel Weber was publicly pleased, praised Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound solidity and made friendly remarks about his future colleagues.
"UBS has achieved the turnaround."
"I am looking forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
But already in September it became clear that everything would turn out quite differently.
A trader of UBS in London had bypassed all protection systems of the bank and gambled away around 1.7 billion euros.
UBS CEO Oswald Grübel, a banker who is not only famous in Switzerland, had to go.
Since then, the Chairman of the Board of Directors of UBS has also been regarded as ailing - and everyone is asking: When will Axel Weber finally arrive?
It has already been announced that Weber will be allowed to advise the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This will be tough for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, but rather an economics professor and central banker and would certainly have needed a training period.
All of a sudden, he takes responsibility for the strategy of a bank that has just proven once again that it has long since earned the title of "Europe's largest scandal bank".
On the one hand, UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and on the other hand, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next for years.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had an excellent reputation.
She had combined the image of the secretive and solid, but also clever Swiss asset manager with ambitious goals: she also wanted to become a big name in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS managed $1.6 trillion, more wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, as an investment bank, it had moved into the league of the largest banks in the world.
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later a long-time banking professor in Zurich, explains: "Back then, I always presented UBS to my students as a model of a good bank."
"From today's point of view, one wonders: How could I be so wrong?"
He was terribly mistaken.
In 2007, it became apparent for the first time that something was going seriously wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Wuffli, who until then had been regarded as a highly intellectual and equally ingenious banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, one could guess why he had left.
The investment division of the bank had gambled away with subprime securities and had to write off billions.
To shoulder this, UBS announced a capital increase of no less than 13 billion Swiss francs.
But she actually found investors, but some that some would have turned up their noses at until recently: a non-transparent Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and an Arab sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive that one did not even learn its name.
But that was only the first blow.
Things got worse in April 2008.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, Chairman of the Board of Directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still the second-best-paid Board of Directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, disaster followed: UBS was on the verge of collapse due to its bad investments in the financial crisis and had to be rescued by the state.
The SNB bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, while the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a forced convertible bond, through which it could become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was shocked - because she noticed how dramatic it is for a small country to host such large banks.
After all, UBS's total assets in 2007 were more than five times as large as Switzerland's economic output (see chart).
"Once again, we could not save UBS," says banking researcher Geiger.
The first catastrophe was followed by the second.
Just a few months later, UBS capitulated in the tax dispute with America and agreed to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had possibly evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it agreed to a payment of 780 million dollars - as a repayment of unjustified profits from these transactions, including a penalty.
UBS thus more or less openly admitted that it had helped with tax evasion.
At the same time, it lost something that had always been its capital in the competition for rich customers: the aura of secrecy.
After the scandal, Swiss banking secrecy was no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Management and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
Within a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking through the erroneous speculation and in asset management through the help of tax evasion.
And just when it calmed down a bit, just when you thought UBS would get it done again, there follows this unfortunate trader story: A single trader gambles away 1.7 billion euros before the bank realizes that something is going wrong.
And it becomes apparent: Risk management in investment banking is obviously still not working.
"With the Adoboli case, we have seen that too little has changed in risk control," says Martin Janssen, economist and finance professor at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The CFO of a large German bank is also certain: "UBS's problem is that it does not have risk control under control."
Yet it had been precisely the idea of caution with which the Swiss bankers had long ago set out to become guardians of the world's great fortunes: not too big risks, but security for money - even if the world might collapse beyond the Alpine republic.
The vaults of Swiss banks had become a symbol of unshakable reliability, just as Lindt and Sprüngli had become for particularly fine chocolate.
The headquarters of UBS in Zurich still fits the cliché of the dignified Swiss private bank - it is just a little bigger.
Even the location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich's Bahnhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are magnificent, the shop rents are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellers like Tiffany's can be found here between traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli.
Swiss banks have resided here for centuries: from the National Bank to the Palace of Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius Baer.
You enter the UBS reception hall through a heavy revolving door.
Inside, the walls are covered in marble, in front of them are thick leather armchairs, next to the bank logo a large sign to the "safe".
UBS knows what its client is looking for: security.
However, both major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point suppressed this idea of the Swiss bank - or betrayed it, as the head of a small Swiss private bank finds.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all, like all Swiss bankers, he also does business with the two big banks.
UBS has become far too big, he thinks – especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have also spread.
The Swiss would have nothing more to say there.
"And if they do, they have long since adapted to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, first brought it high profits and then the debacle: No European financial institution has lost as much money in the subprime jungle as the major Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe became visible.
"On that Wednesday, the governing coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of their nation," writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "The UBS Crash".
The politicians approved up to 68 billion Swiss francs or around 45 billion euros to save the major bank, which was facing bankruptcy.
How did this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, they see the problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged to form a huge group.
The result was a bank that was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger - and continued to grow.
It helped that the two different predecessor banks of UBS complemented each other: a rich but sleepy bank with a focus on asset management in Zurich and a poorer, but already more internationalized one.
Suddenly, the internationalized investment bankers got a lot of cheap money with which they could turn a huge wheel.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," says banking researcher Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the highly intellectual, modest man who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the gut man who has worked his way up from banking apprenticeship to the very top."
But Ospel relied on Wuffli in the end.
And Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake in the end: "He thought his models were reality," says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
One thing is clear: exuberance came before the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings at which CEO Wuffli repeatedly issued the same slogan: Dethrone Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank on earth.
She led the "League Tables", the rankings that documented the success of the banks of the time.
That's where UBS wanted to go to the top.
She had already succeeded in taking a few steps.
In the foreign exchange business and in stock trading, she played at the top.
Management consultants who were commissioned, however, highlighted a weakness: In the international interest business, in the banker's language "fixed income", there is a huge gap to the largest banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost them their existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and a hedge fund founded before it invested in American subprime assets.
It developed into a formidable machine that packaged and passed on securities on American mortgage loans - but also retained risks itself.
Even when other banks had long been looking for an exit.
"In the summer of 2007, when the American real estate market was in flames, UBS bought there," says banking expert Geiger.
As great as the euphoria, so deep is the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when the attempts to clean up turned out to be more difficult than expected.
Posts at UBS became an ejection seat and are still shaky today.
Whoever leads the big bank now has an almost impossible job.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has lost all obvious business models.
Banking researcher Geiger already has an idea: end investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank does not (yet) want to go quite that far.
But investment banking is to shrink sharply, that much is already clear.
Next Thursday, the new bank boss Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italo-Swiss was actually only intended as a temporary solution when the bank surprisingly parted ways with predecessor Grübel.
In the meantime, he has prevailed: He should permanently lead the business of UBS, said the Zurich bank on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to reduce the investment bank to the level of the mid-nineties.
He cuts 3500 jobs.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
How does she want to earn money?
These are the questions Axel Weber is certainly already asking himself.
So far, he has only said publicly that he and his wife will first look for an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on US stock market
The looming recession in Europe has taken the courage of US investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remained without clout.
Reduced industrial production on the continent nipped hopes of stabilizing the debt crisis in the bud.
The general relief over the changes of government in Rome and Athens could not prevail.
The euro fell against the dollar.
The Italian and Greek glass had been considered in the past week as half full, not half empty – but now the problems pushed back into the foreground, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Financials in particular were on the sales lists.
The Dow Jones index of standard stocks was down 0.6 percent at 12,078 points at the close of trading.
In the course of trading, the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.
The broader S&P 500 index closed at 1251 points, down one percent.
The index of the technology exchange Nasdaq lost 0.8 percent and went out of trading at 2657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax said goodbye with a minus of 1.2 percent at 5985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly reduced its production and is preparing for the end of the upswing.
The companies produced in September two percent less than in the previous month, as the statistical office Eurostat announced.
This made US investors skeptical: "We are not an island, but dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe will not be able to extricate itself from a recession so quickly, and there are further signs of weakness in the banks.
Investment legend Warren Buffett only confirmed this caution: It is not yet clear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything to end the crisis, he said in a CNBC interview.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw a decades-old principle over the pile and entered the US technology industry.
His investment of more than ten billion dollars in IBM supported the share price of the traditional group and let him initially quote almost one percent higher against the trend in the course of trading.
The paper closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett says he paid an average of $170 a piece and now holds 5.5 percent.
The share price of his investment company Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America shares fell by 2.6 percent, significantly more than the market.
The house is silvering almost all of the rest of its shares in China Construction Bank, earning $6.6 billion.
With the net profit from the business, the institute wants to cushion its capital ratio and thus comply with tougher regulatory requirements.
The aircraft manufacturer Boeing rose, limiting losses in the Dow.
The stock gained 1.5 percent after the group collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 long-haul 777 aircraft on Sunday and put the value of the order at 18 billion dollars.
Including options for 20 additional machines, the volume even amounts to 26 billion dollars.
On the New York Stock Exchange, around 710 million shares changed hands.
719 values increased, 2281 fell and 79 remained unchanged.
On the Nasdaq, with sales of 1.38 billion shares, 630 closed in the plus, 1913 in the minus and 82 unchanged.
Smart crows spread in cities
In many places, rooks are considered "problem birds": But experts claim that the highly intelligent animals can no longer be driven out of the cities.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly: crows have been part of the cityscape for centuries, but in many municipalities residents complain about the dirt and noise of the animals are piling up.
A remedy against the "problem birds" is not yet in sight.
Seed crows are no longer to get out of the cities, said experts at the first crow symposium in the East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over Germany discussed possible ways out.
You are looking for alternatives in the cities
Conservationists also attributed the problems in cities to the rural exodus of specially protected rooks: The use of chemicals in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional habitats.
Hunting, increasing development and the felling of typical breeding trees made life difficult for the birds.
Crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs exist in Soest in Westphalia, in the northwest in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen as well as in Leer.
There, in 2005, a controversial project for the mass killing of crows in the district had made negative headlines.
Critics had described the capture of the animals in bird traps and the killing with clubs as particularly brutal.
"The normal expulsion, the scaring, brings nothing," said the urban and landscape planner Werner Klöver from Leer.
Spraying away nests with water or felling trees often has undesirable consequences, said environmental expert Manfred Kaiser from Lahr in Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals dodge, large colonies split up and spread elsewhere."
Deterrence is only conceivable as an exception at hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we can't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities could not be solved, said Mayor Wolfgang Kellner from Leer.
A combination of scaring off the animals from sensitive living areas and bait offers is conceivable in order to resettle them in other places.
"Information boards instead of chainsaws", on the other hand, promoted psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jürgens for a completely different approach to animals: "After all, we can best bear a pimple on our face with confidence."
Jürgens had co-founded the Ascheberger Krähen-Lehrpfad in Schleswig-Holstein, where information signs provide information about the life of highly intelligent rooks.
The project has already been accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also had his own opinion on the criticism of the noise of the birds: "There is a lot of communication, they have a lot to say to each other."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: rooks not only use tools to get a treat, but even make their own tools as aids.
Behavioural scientists at the University of Cambridge recently tested how far the birds' intelligence reaches on four rooks.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to bring down a scaffolding with stones in order to get to a moth larva.
Without much training, they single-mindedly recognized the size and shape of a stone to cause the platform to collapse.
In a second attempt, the clever crows then had to solve a trickier problem.
In a vertical cylinder, the researchers had placed a small bucket with a moth larva.
With the beak, the birds could not reach their prey.
However, the researchers had laid pieces of wire in front of them.
From this, all four animals formed a hook, with the help of which they then fished the bucket by the handle out of the tube.
Three of the four rooks even succeeded in doing so right away.
Cristiano Ronaldo shoots Portugal to Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and the Turks for a coup failed to materialise.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland are at the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have won the last tickets to the 2012 European Championship in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by the double successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and made the fifth European Championship participation in a row perfect after the 0-0 draw from the first leg.
The Czechs were enough in the play-off second leg at outsider Montenegro a 1:0 (0:0), after the first leg (2:0) had already been a clear thing.
Croatia did not let anything burn in the 0:0 against Turkey, Ireland won an easy 1:1 (1:0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the other goals for Portugal.
The former Wolfsburg Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a converted penalty (41st) and captain Emir Spahic (65th) had twice shortened for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic saw the yellow-red card (54.).
Bosnia had already failed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa to Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal got off to a perfect start.
Ronaldo chased a free-kick from around 30 yards into the net for an early lead.
A good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his long-range shooting qualities and scored from 25 meters to make it 2-0.
The Bosnians, who did not play in the first half hour, had their first clear chance through striker Edin Dzeko.
The ex-Wolfsburg from the English league leaders Manchester City put a header on the lower edge of the crossbar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33.).
Jiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Subsequently, referee Wolfgang Stark from Ergolding took centre stage.
After an attack on Helder Postiga in the Bosnian penalty area, Stark decided on Schwalbe and showed the Portuguese the yellow card (36.).
On the other side, Stark gave a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which Misimovic safely converted.
But after the break, the 2004 European runner-up made everything clear with four goals.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek ended the last doubts in the 81st minute.
This means that the 1976 European champion will travel to the European Championships for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilek with the Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to survive a moment of shock in the early stages.
Final man Petr Cech prevented a possible own goal by Tomas Sivok (9th) with a reflex at the last moment.
Montenegro had its greatest opportunities when the duo of Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
Damjanovic shot in the 40th minute from the turn from the edge of the penalty area just past the goal of Cech.
After the break, the crossbar had to save for the already beaten world-class goalkeeper of the Czechs, again the striker of FC Seoul had withdrawn (50.).
The goal shortly before the end finally made everything clear.
Turkey, meanwhile, missed the football miracle of Zagreb.
Four days after the 3-0 defeat in Istanbul, the Turks did not get beyond a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink almost certainly has to vacate his place on the bench of the 2002 World Cup third, the Croats can look forward to their fourth participation in a European Championship finals.
In front of 31,000 spectators in the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got off to a dream start.
Selcuk Inan hit the post in the seventh minute with a long-range shot, attacker Kazim Kazim could not sink the rebound into the goal.
After the moment of shock, however, Croatia took more and more control.
Even after the break, the Croats did not let anything burn.
In addition to Mario Mandzukic from VfL Wolfsburg, who made way for Dortmund's Ivan Perisic from the 62nd minute, the Bundesliga legionnaires Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) were also in action.
Trapattoni goes to the European Championships
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first European Championship participation since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward gave coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who had already made a preliminary decision with a 4-0 win in the first leg, the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57th) compensated for the guests.
Ireland pushed the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had the first good chance.
Only at the last moment did the Estonian back team prevent the possible lead.
In the 32nd minute, however, the time had come.
After an unfortunate defence by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to make it 1-0.

SAP wants to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software manufacturer SAP is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double the number of its employees in the country.
By 2015, around two billion dollars (around 1.5 billion euros) are to flow, the Dax Group announced on Tuesday.
"We will create additional research and development facilities and hire employees accordingly," announced co-CEO Bill McDermott at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce is to grow from currently about 2500 to 4500 employees.
The number of branches of the world market leader for enterprise software will double from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of SAP's more than 176,000 customers worldwide are based in the booming country.
The growth plans in China are also an important component of the Dax Group's Strategy 2015.
SAP aims to increase revenue to €20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorf-based company generated around 12.5 billion euros.
The business of the software provider, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is currently doing better than ever before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we want to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
"Our goal is to promote sustainable growth in China, supported by comprehensive education."
Mass slaughter on a personal level
Peter Englund's new book "Schönheit und Schrecken. A history of the First World War, told in nineteen destinies" with a long list of main characters that touches your heart.
Here's a tip on how to proceed: Carefully cut out this page and make it your bookmark.
You will get to know these people very well in Englund's novel-like tale. And these main characters will function as your GPS, as a lighthouse in those few moments when, like Englund's men and women, you are lost in the fog of war and robbed of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which determines the Nobel Prize for Literature.
He has written an unusual book, which he describes not inaccurately as "a work of anti-history".
It contains few big names, important treaties or famous battles. There are hardly any ambassadors, frenzied reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's not so much a book about what happened, he explains, but rather "a book about what it was like." It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Terror" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inconspicuous men and women on both sides of the war combined, from schoolgirls and botanists to mountaineers, doctors, ambulance drivers and office workers.
Some of these people become heroes.
Some become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go crazy or die.
Each of these lives flickers like the votive candles in a church, some are added while others go out.
Englund's book deviates from the usual history books.
It also corrects the notion that World War I was merely the devastating trench warfare on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Terror" wanders with an expert's eye over other theatres of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Beehives fall on the soldiers in this book, one celebrates Christmas under the pyramids in Egypt, tsetse flies are an unsolvable problem.
This is a moving book almost from the beginning.
War is flooding the lives of these people like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina that smells of cordite.
Imagine you are a woman who is at home with her children and hears cannon fire in the distance. Do you stay or do you flee?
Who is coming?
Hardly anyone understands what is happening or why this war is being waged at all.
"Missing facts," Englund notes, "have been brushed up with assumptions, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors."
"Beauty and Terror" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German ship's sailor.
Their stories were mainly taken from memories, letters and other material already published.
Their life stories can be frightening or poignant, but they are extremely vivid in Englund's collection of small moments that lose in details.
Many of them deal with scarcity and help.
In the story of a German schoolgirl, he tells: "Replacement, replacement everywhere."
"Spare coffee, fake aluminum, wrong eraser, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
He tells us more about substitute food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice and baked in mutton fat (and last served with a false bone of wood), tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes soled with wood."
There were, as he notes, "837 registered food substitutes allowed in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes."
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American recognizes his own urge for savagery and says of the war: "One feels that, despite everything, this is what was intended for men rather than sitting in an armchair, with the evening paper or the bestseller and a cigarette and a whiskey in one's hand, and pretending that such a façade means civilization and as if there is no barbarism behind one's starched and fogged shirt breast."
Conversely, a British soldier realizes that he is likely to die and no one will notice or care.
"When you step away from the idea of sacrificing yourself, you want to think that this is happening in front of an audience," he writes.
Instead, it's as horrible as "a condemned man hanged in secret."
Other observations are about old Europe falling apart and new forms of terror.
"The conflict increasingly became an economic contest," writes Englund, "a war between the factories."
He captures the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the still young century": "the eloquent and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a tailor-made suit who slaughters while sitting behind a desk."
People behave in unforeseen ways and there is just as frivolous behavior as heroism.
Englund discusses the soldiers who actively tried to catch a venereal disease from a prostitute in order to escape frontline service.
"The grotesque expression of this can be found in the trade in gonococcal pus, because soldiers bought and smeared themselves on their genitals in the hope of getting to the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really desperate rubbed him in the eyes, causing them to be blind for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from Swedish by Peter Graves, Englund's poetry becomes supple yet unobtrusive, adapting perfectly to its human task.
In dozens of small scenes, he captures the ways in which war "uniquely unleashed uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred."
People are beginning to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War were usually falsified like Paul Fussell's "Great War and Modern Memory" or novels like Erich Maria Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front" than extensive history books.
Englund's band joins an unconventional hall of fame.
His book has the most devastating ending I've ever read about in a nonfiction book.
I won't give it away anymore.
But it is as if he had snatched this page with the main characters from under our noses with his book and lit it with a match.
After an early misstep, a meticulously planned assault
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing service helmets.
They had chosen the night from Monday to Tuesday, because at this time there are hardly any people in Zucotti Park.
The operation was kept secret and few senior officials were informed. Everyone else initially believed they were participating in an exercise.
Police Chief Raymond W. Kelly was in their midst, and his presence underscored the fact that the operation was full of challenges.
The incidents of recent weeks, such as the use of pepper spray against protesters, which violated the rules of the department and gave the squatters an enormous increase in public sympathy, could not be repeated.
And so the police action to remove the protesters from Zuccotti Park was carried out after two weeks of planning and training.
Officials had prepared these by observing how occupations were handled in other cities.
A disaster drill had taken place with a view of Zuccotti on Randall's Island.
Officials stepped up so-called chaos training — counterterrorism measures, which include the rapid deployment of large numbers of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The final training session took place Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to move into the park came "at the last minute," said someone familiar with the commands, which spoke in favor of a declaration as an "exercise."
"The few police officers who were involved, to my knowledge, didn't know it was about Zuccotti Park," said someone who wished to remain anonymous.
"The only ones who knew it was about Zuccotti Park were the senior officials of the department."
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson the city had learned.
On October 14, officials wanted to clear the park, but then backed away when hundreds of protesters gathered after learning of the plans.
Officers from various police units were involved in Tuesday's operation, including task forces from across the city — hundreds of mobile officers normally deployed in highly criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that during the day, many people come and go in the park, almost like commuters, so 1am at night is a good time to go inside.
"It was appropriate to do this when the least number of people are in the park," he said.
Ambulances with Jupiter lights and loudspeakers stood ready before departure at Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and pre-recorded messages blaring from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
When the public officials in their light blue windbreakers entered the park, many protesters simply gathered their belongings and left.
Police said no tents would be touched until 1:45 a.m. to give protesters time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of officers were seen gathering in the area to intervene should arrests become necessary in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, spokesman for the Chief of Police, said this was for their own safety.
But many journalists claim that they wanted to prevent them from observing the police actions in the park. And they said the officers' handling was very rough.
Mr Browne said TV cars could have taken photos on Church Street on the west side of the park.
As the police moved west through the protesters' huge mess of personal belongings, including suitcases, artificial turf and bags of clothes, they were followed by city cleaning workers, who picked up what had been left behind.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside. Pictures of this appeared a short time later on the Internet.
A main nucleus of protesters took up position near the camp's kitchen area in the center of the park.
Some erected barriers and the police continued their methodical arrests.
About 10 people in the epicenter of the camp tied themselves together by their arms.
And two people chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Civil protection officials were called in to cut them loose.
As Mr. Kelly said, no arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m.
The eviction was completed after 75 minutes, according to the police.
Mr Browne said 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests, he said, were for "improper behavior and resistance to arrest."
The most prominent officer on the ground was Joseph J. Esposito, the chief of the department, the division's highest uniformed officer.
Phil T. Pulaski, chief of detectives, was also there.
Despite his presence, Mr. Kelly "did not "lead the operation," as Mr. Browne said.
In case they were to intervene, a second group of officers waited on the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Streets.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, one block further south.
It could be observed how from these locations the police extended the radius further and further around the Zuccotti Park.
At one location, several officers, many of them wearing protective shields, were seen driving people outside.
About 28 people were in the northern area.
Some of the most violent actions of the night took place in the south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, a protester jumped onto the roof of a police vehicle and other protesters let the air out of the tire of a police van.
At one place, the crowd threw a piece of plywood.
In the end, an official and a protester were taken to the hospital.
Caregivers' union will file lawsuit against city over layoffs
The union, which represents hundreds of school caregivers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday arguing that the layoffs are unnecessary and discriminatory due to its undue influence on the schools that teach poor students.
The lawsuit is likely the last option left to the union, District Council 37, in its efforts to reverse the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school workers, care coordinators and other staff who were among the city's lowest-paid employees and lost their jobs in a move on October 7 that union leaders described as political revenge for last year's denial of the city access to a health fund maintained by the working groups to fill the budget gap.
This accusation was categorically denied by the authorities.
At a city council hearing last month, Dennis M. Walcott, director of schools, said the layoffs were part of the budget it passed in June.
A member of the city council shot back, telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school aid workers would be laid off.
City Council 37 officials said they had and warned the Ministry of Education against filing a lawsuit. On Wednesday, there will be a press conference at which the filing of the lawsuit before the Supreme Court in Manhattan will be formally announced.
The lawsuit will list Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and count eight laid off workers as plaintiffs, all of whom are women of color or Latino like most of the aid workers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Justice, said the city did not have the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its individual claims.
According to a draft lawsuit obtained by the New York Times, the union focused on the number of layoffs at schools in the city's slums to support a lawsuit for unequal treatment. She claims that poor schools have lost more helpers because they are chronically underfunded.
She argues that while there have been no layoffs on Staten Island and few layoffs in Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 school workers have lost in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 workers have been laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five out of eight school helpers employed at Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit states, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can organize donations to absorb budget cuts."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th district was cut by 3.26 percent this year. In addition, funds were lost when the city changed its method of calculating extra funding for each school enrollment.
The union also complains that the heads of the high schools were misled by the language in a memo approving the dismissal of the care coordinators.
The memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even though "excess" (german: transfer) in the U.S. usually describes a teacher's move from a school's payroll to a pool of available workers paid by the Central Agency.
"Sixty-six care coordinators were dismissed, not transferred," the draft lawsuit states.
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
In the end, it looks like Republicans and Democrats in Washington are already coming to an understanding on the uprisings in Libya.
All it took was the success of the revolt, the arrest and assassination of longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi, and an end to American interference.
On Thursday, the Senate International Relations Committee passed a resolution under Chairman John Kerry (Massachussetts) along with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut), praising Libya for the successful rebellion and US troops for their "courage."
"This resolution honors the brave people of Libya who have begun to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
"It is an endorsement of bipartisan support for their democratic efforts."
The language may sound innocent, but so far nothing has been easy in the Libya debate.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties and the White House argued over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or disapproving of the U.S. military's role in NATO's Libya mission.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of US military forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected in the Senate by a broad fringe group of both parties and there was no vote.
But on the same day, this bill failed in the Senate. In addition, the chamber overruled a decision to cut funding for American operations in Libya.
This put the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory, with a Congress that was outraged enough to criticize Obama's actions on the mission, but not angry enough to pull the rug out from under his feet once and for all.
Then Congressional indecision was overtaken by events.
Tripoli fell under Libyan rebels in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate may be ready to act.
The resolution of the Committee on International Relations "congratulates the people of Libya on their tremendous courage and extraordinary perseverance in their self-liberation" and "commends the men and women of the U.S. military and their coalition partners who support military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism."
The resolution also reaffirms "the national interests of the United States in Libya's successful and irrevocable transition to democracy."
Will the new measures receive full support from the Foreign Relations Board, or will they divide lawmakers, as the June law did?
The last version meets with opposition from Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indianapolis), the top Republican of the committee.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new law.
According to the Capitol, it's up to the Senate to vote this week on a constitutional amendment calling for a balanced budget, a top priority in nearly every congressional term of Republicans and some Democrats.
The measures, led by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment to the budget or other area currently being voted on in the Senate or Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far tried unsuccessfully to bring their amendments to the vote, although they have tried often enough.
Goodlatte's amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress that cover a wide range of issues.
Some are double—the same bill has been submitted to both Congress and the Senate—others differ only slightly.
There are at least 15 versions of the balancing budget amendment in the Senate alone, and another dozen that would "control federal spending."
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their principals — especially Republican beginners who want to polish up their resumes — the opportunity to brag that they "wrote" such a measure.
The Budgetary Control Act, passed in August, requires both the Senate and Congress to vote on a change to the balancing of the budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favor of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such a change.
Beyond the budget, some members want to limit the number of provisions that members of Congress can submit, while Republican José E. Serrano (New York) wants to remove the two-term limit for the president.
Republican Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) has proposed a series of changes that guarantee, among other things, the right to good education and health care.
An amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage, as is a change prohibiting the burning of flags, is a recurring template.
Some lawmakers also want to allow federal laws to be repealed if two-thirds of states oppose them.
As eagerly as the members propose changes, as much faster they move as in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators introduced 77 such amendments. in the 110th Congress 66.
The pace pales in comparison to that of the early 1990s, when members regularly proposed more than 150 changes every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they weren't much more successful than today's.
The last amendment to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but was actually proposed to Congress as early as 1789.
"Hit, but not defeated," Giffords said in the first television interview after the assassination.
Ten months after an armed man shot her at close range during a Tucson election rally, Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) appeared on national television Monday night. She sang alone to the Broadway play "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said the desire to recover was greater than that of returning to Congress.
When she appeared with Diane Sawyer on ABC's "20/20" news, she struggled for words and needed help walking.
The broadcast showed the severe slow recovery from the damage caused by the bullet that parted her skull, pierced the left side of her brain and crossed her head from front to back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to Congress to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt brake.
In her first television interview after the January attack, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Gifford smiled, laughed and sang — and described her recovery as "difficult."
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford, 41, replied, "Pretty good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special recorded shortly before the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Tale of Courage and Hope."
The special follows Gifford's recovery since the January 8 attack.
In videos Kelly recorded in the first few weeks, she can be seen in a hospital bed, with her head shaved bald and a long scarf over her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers if her husband encourages her to do so.
Months later, Giffords sits in a wheelchair while therapists show her how to perform simple movements.
A nod of the head.
A twitch of the lips.
And then, her first words: "What."
After a few days, Giffords whispers another word: "Toast." She wants her breakfast changed.
Videos played on the ABC show show that music played an important role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman can be seen singing alongside the therapists to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fallin'."
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who spends two hours a day on therapy, said she can't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he had read Giffords an article in a daily newspaper about the attack on March 12 when she interrupted him and asked for the first time about the six people killed during the attack.
The alleged shooter, Jared Lee Loughner, is incarcerated in a Missouri prison and is receiving forcibly medical treatment while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died," Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard."
As his wife recovered, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I was hit."
"So, I would say, 'Gabby, you haven't been defeated,'" Kelly said.
You were only hit.
And you're going to get through that and you're going to recover and you're going to come back stronger than ever before.
Troops feel pity rather than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, frustration and loss.
On cue, a hundred soldiers, sailors, pilots and marines gathered around him.
The crowd in black tuxedos stood up and applauded.
"The soldiers were seen as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the fundraiser in the spring.
A senior military officer at the gala, observed by Chief of Staff and then Chairman Admiral Mike Mullen, among others, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were introduced like orphans," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers meant well.
I know that.
But it wasn't respect, not really. It was pity.
The stark contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship between the military and the mostly distant, sometimes admiring American public.
The troops are showered with praise for their sacrifices.
But the praise comes at a price, officials say.
The public is increasingly behaving as if it feels sorry for people in uniform.
"We were by no means victims," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But apparently the only way of support is to squeeze us into the role of unhappy souls."
The issue is extremely sensitive to military leaders who do not want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realized that the anger faced by returning troops in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, conversations about compassion take place quietly and privately between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from fighting with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people outside the military world could see their service from two different perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe, having defeated rebels and traveled to exotic locations.
Others would wonder if an "angry, violent veteran is hiding beneath the surface," said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and took over a senior state post in Washington upon his return.
As he searched for work, he said, he sensed that some of the interrogators were subtly asking if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding post in Washington as soon as he returned from combat.
"When you talk about your ministry, you have to keep the negative impressions against it," Cancian told his sons.
The military's lack of ease is rooted in part America's lack of interest in war.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely praised by a country that has little military experience and sees little benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism as it was absolutely common during World War II," said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the praise of politicians and the public is largely focused on the suffering of a service member.
Troops are recognized for the number of attacks they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the severity of their injuries.
Military faces growing pressure to crack down on rape
This week, a key hearing will decide whether 28 women and men will be charged with failing to intervene in rape before the military court.
If this does not happen, hundreds of plaintiffs will be available for the next hearing.
Corporal Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant when she was raped by a fellow soldier at night.
It was October 2008 and she was returning to her barracks in Miramar, north of San Diego, from dinner with a friend when she ran into a male colleague carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked her if he could accompany her to her room for a drink.
"My alarm bells went off," Lyman said.
But the Texan brushed aside her concerns.
I thought, "Oh, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I had listened to my gut feeling."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stepped behind her, pushed her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, Nov. 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military employees are anxiously awaiting a trial with a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, to decide whether a lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will be allowed in court.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld did not address widespread rape within the military and in violation of soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but they rose to 28 in the months that followed: 25 women and three men, all of whom allege they were raped or sexually abused by fellow soldiers, and that the military failed to investigate, convict, or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she is persecuting the top military leadership because that's where the problem begins.
"The military is hierarchical," she says.
"Who are the individuals who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The leadership."
Burke also says she has contacted nearly 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Their strategy: Instead of all plaintiffs putting their eggs in one basket, so to speak, they will, if necessary, file many more lawsuits to keep up the pressure.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
The court's files, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy, primarily that the military cannot be charged by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court law known as the Feres Doctrine, the government is not liable for injuries inflicted on soldiers on active duty.
"The alleged damage occurred during the plaintiffs' military service," the document says.
The Ministry of Defense refuses to comment on this story.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to serve in combat, the distinction lies only in the name: modern wars rarely have clear fronts.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers are playing increasingly important roles, especially in connecting with local women in the war zones.
The result: between these two wars, 150 female soldiers died, two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to be modernized, Burke says.
And she is not alone in her fight: three other lawsuits besides her are pending.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic is preparing a lawsuit against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
Separately, the nonprofit Vietnam Veterans of America is raking a lawsuit against the military, focusing on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that rape victims received in order to dismiss them from service — a common practice, according to activists such as Anu Bhagwati of the Service Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Her group filed a lawsuit against the Veterans Administration in December, accusing it of discriminatory practices in its handling of benefit claims for individuals who claimed to have been sexually abused while on duty.
Nine bills were independently submitted to Congress by a mix of senators and bipartisan representatives, providing a number of clues.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual abuse cases were reported, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office.
But most abuses go unreported at all, and according to the Pentagon's own estimate, this figure takes into account about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 cases that occur each year.
The report, released in March, also examines law enforcement rates: in 2010, 20 percent of recorded cases ended up in the military, only half as many as in civil law.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case describe their attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, she reported the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after the robbery.
That night, she says, she was asked 11 times to tell the details of her rape to a number of policemen, doctors and commanders.
She had a rape kit and her attacker's blood, which came from a cut on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard by a judge. During this hearing, she was asked about the sex she had with her boyfriend before the assault.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read," says Lyman.
"I thought the contractions would start. I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They took me to the psychiatric ward and I remember when I came out, I said to my commander, 'This was not his case.' That was my procedure."
Lyman was asked to see a military psychiatrist, who ultimately diagnosed a personality disorder and declared her unfit for duty.
In January 2010, she was dishonorably discharged, leaving her with no support.
Whether the lawsuit filed by Lyman and the other plaintiffs will move forward is pure speculation, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington University Law School.
Still, he notes, "I think they should move forward."
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine, which has been criticized since it was first questioned.
I have been a lifelong critic of the Feres doctrine.
The military is a decade behind, because they don't have the same incentive and deterrent that liability brings.
He adds: "The odds are against them... But it's important for them to try."
These things will only change if good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't follow her path, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will begin with her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until there are reforms," she says.
Or until we die, whichever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Watch You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just one of many guys who broadcast their anti-immigration opinions online.
On Monday, Breivik, who has confessed to committing crimes in a July shooting spree in Norway that killed 77 people, had his first public hearing in court.
Although Breivik may have acted alone, he is far from alone in cyberspace: he spent much of his time in front of his computer before his attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support far-right groups on social media.
After this summer's tragedy, researchers wanted to find out more about these people.
But how do you find them?
It's easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We found that it wasn't hard to get to them," says Jamie Bartlett, the lead author of a recent report by the British think tank DEMOS on digital populism in Europe.
Facebook's hiding place for personal data is so encyclopedic, Bartlett says, that researchers simply have to use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy — just as marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of far-right groups across Europe and then targeted them with Adds, but instead of linking to a new band or diet product, the Adds invited users to a survey asking about their level of education, attitudes toward violence, and their assessment of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries — without even having to leave their offices.
"It's a fairly new research method," Bartlett says.
Some of the results are hardly surprising. Online promoters of far-right groups are mostly young, male, and annoyed by immigration.
But in a kind of surprising twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more sensible, democratic, and less violent than those who sit behind their computer screens."
DEMO's work is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new hot tool in the hands of scientists.
Think tanks, medical researchers, and political scientists use the site to study everything from health issues to societal trends like in "likes," text messages, and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content per day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom that has increased the number of scientific papers with this page's name in the title by nearly 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is the fact that through this page you can study people you normally can't reach with your clipboard on the street.
"In the past, if you tried to interview people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They had to inform the party first, and they would never have allowed them access," Bartlett says.
"With Facebook, that's all gone — you go straight to them."
Others say the site provides a way to identify and solve social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their intoxication on Facebook were significantly more likely to drink problems than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moreno suggests that peer students, such as housing counselors, monitor the site and help a student if it posts too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you haven't recognized it," Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of child health, behavior and development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle, told The Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify vulnerable children who would not have been found otherwise."
Facebook is also constantly tapping into the data of its own population.
The site's data team compiled statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using information that only Facebook has access to — masters of digital freedom have long known that the site should make its vast treasure trove of data available to others for research purposes.)
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not. In order to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, you allow the site to share your personal information.
But what if Facebook's users become part of a survey they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict guidelines on how they collect their data offline, everything is allowed online.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, says of a 2006 study in which he examined students' public pages on Facebook.
"As for her, it was all about her and her friends."
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research participant will be completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know how much of the information in a user's profile and posts is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things," Selwyn says.
Therefore, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people," he says.
"Social research has to take care of the social – and a lot of social life still takes place offline."
"Cold and inhumane": Anders Behring Breivik appears for the first time in a public court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to two shootings in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and a Knights Templar of Norway," he said outside a courtroom of more than 500 people.
"I object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that support hate ideologies and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I acknowledge the laws, but I plead not guilty."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform where he can express his views."
For the same reason, he denied Breivik, who brought a pre-written speech, permission to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, without him having access to the media for four weeks. He said authorities will closely monitor all visits and correspondence over eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to look Breivik in the eye, others wanted confirmation that he was behind bars.
Everyone took part with the aim that everything would come down to locking them away.
"I thought he looked cold and inhuman," a survivor of Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it goes a bit further after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Breivik wore a dark suit and blue tie and appeared calm and professional throughout the hearing. He looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's bizarre suggestion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge concluded that he was not mentally ill and said there was no evidence that he had accomplices.
Some may like the fact that the July 22 attacks appear to have been the work of a single extremist, rather than a group of radicals.
But does this automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire nation still feels?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't," said the relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if he did."
7 lessons from the interview with the late Steve Jobs shown in a theater this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, highlighting the technical genius as a great modern inventor.
But perhaps what Apple fans find most revealing in the recently rediscovered Jobs interview, which was dusted off this week ahead of special screenings in major markets, is how much this creative mind understood business processes and workflows.
He was certainly a designer, a dreamer, and a self-proclaimed hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer eagerly tinkering with diagrams—a man who believed that many business leaders suffer from "a disease of thinking that a really great idea makes up 90 percent of the work... [but] there's an enormous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph der Fachidioten" about the advent of the personal computer. And he sat with Jobs for more than an hour, during which they had one of the rare, in-depth conversations.
At that point, more than 10 years had passed since Jobs had been pushed out of Apple. And he was already working his new computer company, NeXT, and was looking forward to the widespread adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringley's interview was used in professional idiots, he says the interview's copy templates were missing on delivery.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the principal's garage.
This slightly revised footage forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview", which comes to the Landmark theatres this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for loathing in-depth interviews, Jobs here appears surprisingly eager to explain his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And incredibly thoughtful.
In the course of the interview, there are four longer pauses between question and answer - 10 to 15 seconds of contemplation, in which Jobs clearly weighs his thoughts and strives for accuracy.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to light when he seems impatient to Cringely's questions and pushes him to respond more quickly to topics or subplots of greater importance.
Recorded before the era of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the Lost Interview seems somehow incredibly far-sighted when Jobs evaluates what he thinks other companies are doing right or wrong and represents his own vision for the future of the computer.
It's one thing to read posthumous tributes to Jobs' career. But seeing Jobs here as the eager dreamer on the verge of greatness is something quite different, original and inspiring.
He has a vision of how things could and should be.
Shortly after he had done all this, he went and did it.
A quick look at seven notable sequences of the Lost Interview:
How he learned to run a business:
"Throughout all the years in business, I always ask, 'Why do you do things?' And the answer you always get is, "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does. No one in the business really thinks deeply about things.
That's what I've noticed.
Jobs continues his efforts to streamline accounting at Apple.
Stunned at how costs were recorded—usually starting with "standard costs" that were quantified on mere guesswork and then adjusted with "deviation"—he developed an automated factory that ensured that business costs could be determined down to the smallest detail.
How the Pope was ridiculed:
Jobs talks about the "Blue Box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed you to sneak into the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
Much has been written about the device, but Jobs' enthusiasm when he describes the blue box as an act of self-empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak would test the box by using a toll phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another while looping through as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things around the globe half a dozen times and if you yelled into the phone, it came out a minute later on the phone next door," Jobs says with a chuckle.
"We were young and we learned that we could build something ourselves that could control trillions of dollars of infrastructure around the world."
Both of us, we didn't know much, but we were able to build this little thing that can control a gigantic thing, that was an incredible lesson and I don't think Apple would exist without them.
Jobs goes on to tell of a glorious prank that Wozniak and he almost pulled off when they called the Vatican in the middle of the night via Blue Box and wanted to talk to the Pope, while imitating Henry Kissinger as best they could.
Since several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two had to laugh before the Pope himself got on the phone.
How he fell in love with technology (and called Bill Hewlett unprepared):
At the age of 12, when he was looking for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone call, Jobs landed a part-time job at Hewlett-Packard for the summer.
"That had a remarkable impact on me. It was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my views of what a company was and how well it treated its employees."
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was the size of a suitcase, had a small screen with a Braun tube and I fell in love with it.
I would climb to the top of HP as a teenager and hang on to this machine and write programs for it.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview, Jobs talks about how to spontaneously invent new products.
Early in his career, when he was installing some circuit boards, he was asked by a customer to assemble the entire computer.
He worked with a payment deadline of only 30 days and had to think through both the assembly and delivery of the finished equipment.
Later at Apple, he recalls the problems he had developing a computer mouse:
"I remember resounding arguments... They yelled at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up, went out and found a manufacturer."
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could have built for $15. That was incredibly credible.
On large companies that are declining:
Long before he revived Apple, Jobs foresaw the ways in which so many industrial giants stumbled with their visions and lost control of their shares.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make a better copier or printer, so what?"
They have the stock monopoly, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [it's people like that] who ultimately run the companies and the product that pushes people out of decision-making.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being eradicated by the people who have no concept of good products vs. bad products - craftsmanship necessary.
This is what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have owned the entire computer industry.
You could have been ten times bigger if it had been Microsoft in the 1990s...
They have caught the defeat from victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"There's a lot of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product... when you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
You learn a lot about its subtleties.
You have to make votes, certain things you can't do, but electrons, glass, robots, factories.
You have to remember 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
At the end of the day, it boils down to taste, it boils down to trying to deal with the best stuff that humans have created, and then trying to bring those things together into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We are always shameless in stealing great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh great was that the people who worked there were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians who happen to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn't for the computer industry, they would be doing fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dine with opponents of health care laws as court takes case
On the day the Supreme Court gathers behind closed doors to discuss the politically divisive question of whether it will hear a challenge to President Obama's health care laws, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will represent the case in court.
The incident took place last Thursday when all nine judges met for a meeting to discuss the petitions for consideration.
One of the cases to be dealt with was a lawsuit filed by 26 states against the far-reaching health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that became buzzword among conservative activists across the US.
The judges agreed to the hearing. In fact, a 5 1/2-hour basic discussion is expected in March, the outcome of which is likely to kick-start the 2012 presidential battle, which will be in full swing by the time the court decision is announced.
The lawyer who will stand trial claiming that the law should be overturned is likely to be Paul Clement, once attorney general under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that supported the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-established group dedicated to defending conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations, the National Federation of Independent Business, which is challenging the law.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which is financially involved in the outcome of the process.
The dinner took place at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court deliberated on the case.
Among others, Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republicans in the Senate and an avowed opponent of health care reform, had service
The guests of the dinner? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges have been attending events of the Federalist Society for years.
And this does not violate moral rules.
In fact, judges are freeing themselves from the code of conduct that governs the actions of lower federal judges.
If they were, they would probably fall under Principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge may participate in charity events of law and other organizations, the judge not being a speaker, guest of honor or, according to the program, a guest of honor at such events."
Nevertheless, Scalia and Thomas' extreme proximity to two of the law firms associated with the case, as well as a company with a massive financial interest in it, was enough to alert morality and government activists.
"This startling break with morality and the contrast with the Code belies the claims of some judges that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, president of Common Cause, a civil rights movement in the US.
"The judges won and dined during a charity event with lawyers with pending cases at the court."
Their appearance and support of a fundraiser for this event undermines any claim to impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas show little regard for critics who say they too easily confuse court matters with agenda-driven groups, such as the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife Ginni is a well-known conservative activist.
Conservatives, on the other hand, claim that it is Judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was attorney general under the Obama administration when the first legal challenges came to court in the first instance.
Her critics urged Kagan to withdraw herself from hearing the case because of bias, saying she was too involved in defending the law to be unbiased.
Kagan makes no attempt to do so.
Boeing lands record $18 trillion order
Emirates orders 50 two-flight Boeing 777 aircraft with an option for 20 additional aircraft.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 trillion.
It's really rare news that a company gets an order for 50 of its products.
But it's big business when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the list price for those 50 planes totals a record $18 trillion.
Equally unusual is Boeing's client: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that Middle Eastern airlines will need $2,520 aircraft worth $450 trillion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest order ever for commercial aircraft, measured by the value of the order: 50 two-speed Boeing 777 jets.
The hammer order came from the airline Emirates from Dubai.
The airline also has an option to purchase 20 more aircraft, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show in 2011, bringing the total list price to $26 trillion.
On Monday, according to Boeing, Oman Air ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which enormously improves fuel consumption and passenger comfort.
The list price for six of these aircraft is more than $1 trillion.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, a stock market executive at Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So they don't just have the money to pay for the planes. Rather, a rise in oil prices, which usually hurts airlines as it is one of their biggest costs, is not so damaging because the country earns from a higher oil price.
That's important because they're less inclined than other airlines to cancel or postpone aircraft orders when oil prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural hedge," he said.
Emirates' order reinforces Boeing's leadership position in the widebody market and helps keep Airbus' rival SAS at bay, which is attacking supremacy with the A350.
Boeing's victory at the show comes four months after Airbus announced it would postpone the launch of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It postponed the launch to gain more confidence after customers demanded a higher payload and range.
Boeing shares rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican president's sister apparently loses election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug traffickers supported opponent Fausto Vallejo of the PRI in the race for governor.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon apparently lost her candidacy for governor of Muchoacan during the violent state elections. She claimed on Monday that drug traffickers had influenced the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to the preliminary results, Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Party of the Revolution, the PRI, has won the race for governorship in the Western state.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," Luisa Maria Calderon said in a radio interview a day after Sunday's election.
"They threatened our candidates, our staff in the polls ... They have occupied polling booths, set up roadblocks... and people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
But they are striving for a return and the victory in Michoacan is an important step in this effort.
The PRI is hoping for a victory in the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have narrowly beaten Claderon, who had led in the polls before election day.
Calderon, a candidate of her brother's conservative Partido Acción Nacional PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), the current governor, came in third, a heavy defeat for the divided and hapless left leadership for the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to accept the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the capital of Morelia, denies links to drug traffickers and urges the other candidates to accept the findings.
Michoacan has long been ruled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and amphetamines.
It is the homeland of President Calderon, and he chose Michoacan to launch a military-led offensive against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN mayor was killed a week before the election during an election rally for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates dropped out of the local elections out of fear.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, no matter how repugnant the elections in Michoacan may seem.
The man who is likely to represent the PRI in the presidential race is Enrique Pena Nieto, who congratulated Vallejo from Washington and said, "I think this victory makes us bravely look ahead to next year."
ADB urges Asia to help bail out eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is calling on India and China to support the rescue of the eurozone in its severe debt crisis to prevent a long-term downward trend that will slow the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, administrative director of the Manila-based ADB, said the world's two fastest-growing economies must do "everything in their power" to accelerate the currency bloc's recovery, either through the International Monetary Fund or through direct reciprocal arrangements.
He warned against the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China) looking "dispassionately" at the difficulties in Europe, saying that Asia's financial support for European leadership and resources helps prevent a long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in the same boat."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of this crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's not immune."
"So if China and India can help, it can help by any means."
Europe's monetary union has been plunged into a severe debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's interest costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of both Italy and Greece have resigned.
The looming severe debt crisis in Europe is fueling fears that the global economy could plunge into recession and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to band together to support the eurozone.
Mr. Nag predicted that any support to Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said reciprocal arrangements – such as buying bonds from the EU bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) – would provide greater bargaining power for European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything in its power" to help the eurozone as its own economy now suffers from falling exports and the drying up of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent," he said.
"We are facing major challenges and we need to maintain a high level of growth."
"It's not an option, it's a mission, because where else can we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no reason to help rich Europeans when they themselves face major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe to India's 1.2 trillion people, more than $800 million of whom live on $2 or less a day.
"Eventually, they will find out that Greeks retire at 50 and spend holidays at the beach. Then you have a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, administrative director of the World Economic Forum, similarly asked why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's numerous and well-paid civil servants, with jobs in poorly managed, loss-making facilities such as the railway.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crises will have "significant domino effects" across Asia.
The ADB's forecast of economic growth of 7.5 percent in Asia for 2011 now threatens "the risk of downgrading" due to the imminent danger from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets need to create "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a downward trend and significant capital outflow of their communities.
Urgent warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta fired up Congress on Monday when he warned that automatic budget cuts would quietly weaken national security. In doing so, he set off a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon to the theatres of war in Afghanistan and the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already considering $450 trillion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that further cuts of $600 trillion or more will be necessary if Congress fails to reach a deal on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta wrote in a letter to Republican Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said a failure by Congress to reach a budget agreement, which will lead to a so-called seizure, would lead to 23% blanket cuts as well as a halt to numerous new projects.
"Such a large cut, carried out in such a reckless manner, would render most of our ship and construction projects unfeasible — you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or building — and seriously harm other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to involuntarily part with a large part of our civilian personnel and, since the reduction would be implemented so quickly, we would almost certainly have to leave civilians on leave to achieve the goal."
"These changes would destroy the faith of those who maintain our military and seriously damage our alert."
The cuts will ultimately hit the combat forces," Panetta said.
"While wartime contingents in the fight against terrorism are not directly affected by the seizure, the serious encroachment on the basic budget would adversely affect the war effort," Panetta warned.
"Personnel hiring would be cut, which would lead to delays in hiring and hiring oversight that support the war."
"Staff salaries would be cut, leading to late payments to wartime traders, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators responded to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for more details regarding the potential impact of the automatic cuts on the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a seizure of the Department of Defense would usher in a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power."
"We are vehemently opposed to this draconian act," the senators said in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they released Panetta's letter.
"This is an outcome we cannot live with, and it is certainly not one that should be imposed on us."
"Seizure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its intervention should not be allowed."
Whether Panetta letter and the senators' new warnings will increase pressure for a compromise in the budget or increase calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly blunt about the possible cuts, even though he had many years of experience with the budget in Congress and the White House before coming to the head of the Pentagon, and knows he faces tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a bleak picture of what might lie ahead — a military with a shell but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors."
"It's a brigade without ammunition."
"It's an air force squadron without adequately trained pilots."
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of accomplishing the mission," Panetta said in his opening address at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that lacks morale and alertness and is unable to take on potential adversaries."
"It actually makes you angry."
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta provided new details on how reductions "create significant operational risks: delays in times of crisis, conflict and disaster, severe limitations on our global operational and response capabilities, resulting in an unacceptable risk in future war operations."
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could fall victim to the cancellation, including those that have already been tested and are already in the early stages of planning.
This list also includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, the next generation ballistic submarines, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace the Humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save up to $80 trillion over the next 10 years, but proponents say it's an important next step toward armament so that potential dangers from China and other adversaries can be averted.
How to expose a lie
A look at the current headlines shows how alarming and widespread deception and lies are in daily life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy dealing with allegations of sexual harassment by several women. Both sides accuse each other of lying.
Penn State management is accused of perjury for allegedly withholding reports that a retired football coach sexually abused boys.
Last week, French President Nikolas Sarkozy told US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar over an open microphone.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weidner made a fool of himself when he circulated denials that were quickly refuted by incontrovertible evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards is accused of campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And then, of course, no one who has experienced it forgets the media circus that President Bill Clinton unleashed when he lied about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in the Oval Office.
Stories about cheating at school and college exams are widespread.
There have been incidents where teachers have given their students the exam answers so that they themselves did well in their performance reviews.
Mentors who should teach the opposite send a message that lying and cheating are okay.
How much deception do we experience?
As studies show, we lie between 10 and 200 times a day.
However, many of these lies are considered white lies.
Another study shows that strangers lie to each other three times during the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Recognizing lies or "exposing lies" is one that is important for every person to learn, both for personal and professional reasons.
Far from a parlour game such as charades, in which the goal is to shout "Get you!", debunking a deception is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities that have conducted wide-ranging research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
One result of the research is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Lies look you in the eye.
They stutter, stammer, blush and do not always fidget.
However, one must not conclude from this that these liars are difficult to uncover and expose.
A skilled liar can get through to the truth by learning about the structure of the claim, the fine facial expressions, questioning and timing.
I have spent several years studying the scientific findings of the vast and ever-growing field of exposure. And it is clear that debunking deception is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helps us navigate our complex world, especially when hiring or questioning people or negotiating or administration are part of our own professional responsibilities.
Good liars are very good at assessing other people, arousing their interest and controlling their own emotions. And they intuitively sense how they are perceived by others.
Thanks to research, we know that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men are more likely to tell "self-oriented" lies than women whose lies are more "oriented towards others" – usually trying to protect the feelings of others – that married people lie to their partners less often than unmarried people (but the lies they tell are mostly "fat lies").
We also know that when a person has been exposed as an evildoer, others feel less guilty for lying to that person.
How do you tell if someone is lying?
First, by observing that person's normal behavior.
This is called "baselining", the starting position.
It provides a reference point for later evaluation of changes.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the voice quality of your subject.
They should better know when someone usually trips with their foot all the time, so they don't wrongly blame them when they trip with their foot during a meeting.
Then pay attention to accumulations of conspicuous verbal and nonverbal behaviors.
Think of these accumulations as alarm bells ringing, not evidence of exposure.
People who deceive may freeze when they try to remember their history. Maybe their feet point toward the door, or they lean toward the exit, change their position in significant ways, or show a "post-interview relaxation," that deep, relaxing exhalation, and change in posture when all the hard questions are over.
Questioners often mistakenly signal that an interview is over, only to look for that relaxation after the interview.
Also pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson's slip-up is famous when he used the past tense when he claimed his slain wife was still alive and sparked a national search for her.
Deceptive people may also use distancing language: "I didn't have a sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you repeat a tricky question as a whole.
The most common verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualifying language" when answering a tricky question: "Well... to tell you the truth... As far as I know... to the best of our knowledge and belief."
This makes the answer more perceptive than factual, which often rings alarm bells.
There is no magic bullet for exposing lies, but you can learn skills that make exposure possible.
Thanks to these skills, anyone is less likely to become a victim of fraudsters, both in private and professional life.
Controversial oil pipeline plan to be revised after threat from delayed US approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, angering unions while reassuring environmentalists, the pipeline-building company is seeking to redesign the project so it can return to normal.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will divert the planned pipeline from the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska House of Representatives.
TransCanada's Alex Pourbax said the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, albeit on a different course.
This comes after a State Department announcement last week that a decision on federal approval for the project would be postponed until the new possible course that avoids the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, a large underwater, is reviewed.
"This is a real step forward," Republican Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department may postpone a decision until 2013, after next year's elections, though officials deny politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama said in a written statement last week that the decision was a task for the State Department and pledged his support.
The 1700-mile pipeline would connect Canada with the Gulf of Mexico.
It would pump 700,000 barrels of oil per day from the province of Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do this, the pipeline would have to cross six states.
Environmentalists hate them, but labor markets love them because they estimate that the pipeline will create 20,000 jobs.
But Nebraska lawmakers, opposed to the plan, are weighing the laws to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project would have little impact on the environment, but the energy industry source says the department's chief auditor requested a separate probe of the review process, which focuses on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, has a conflict of interest.
The other is whether a company hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it is associated with TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle charged for allegedly forcing a toddler to vomit out of fear
A New York family claims that disco diva Patti LaBelle had a fit of rage in the lobby of her Manhattan building, which frightened her young daughter so much that she vomited in fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffers from "personality changes, sleep disturbance" and "increased fear of strangers," her family told the Manhattan Supreme Court.
It was November 10 last year when stagehand Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve wanted to leave for a family outing.
While Kevin Monk fetched the car, Roseanna Monk walked into the lobby in her building on Riverside Boulevard with her luggage and Genevieve in her arms.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and dropped her daughter off for a moment.
"Someone appeared behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to hug her again," she said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"She said in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't drop your daughter near the door,'" Roseanna Monk said.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started scolding - she used the F-word and the A-word and got very loud...
She had a bottle of water in her hand and began to pour water from the bottle onto me.
She said Genevieve had become hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle pounced on the mother, who was still carrying Genevieve in her arms, and had to be restrained by her companion and pulled to a waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The baby was screaming so hard that he vomited, she said.
The LaBelle family later wrote to apologize but received no response.
LaBelle's attorney and representative did not respond to calls requesting comment.
The lawsuit is for unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he is not charging fees and the family plans to donate the money they receive to Children's Cancer Aid.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take responsibility for her behavior," Davis said.
"This kind of behavior is absolutely unacceptable, especially when shown to a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18-month-old baby in her arms."
Climatic adversity slowed down the economy
In the first year that Mario López Valdez is in government, unemployment and undeclared work rose in Sinaloa, while foreign investment declined and the economy stagnated.
2011 will be remembered in Sinaloa's economic history. It is the first year that Mario López Valdez, who describes himself as the initiator of change and raised great hopes for economic growth, is in government. However, as a result of climatic adversities, there can be no question of growth; on the contrary, the main economic indicators deteriorated.
The low temperatures in February not only caused losses in the millions of dollars in agriculture, but also placed tight limits on the growth of the state economy and caused a general decline in economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first quarter, mainly due to the historical decline in agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which had a dampening effect on other sectors of the economy.
According to a report on the effects of the frost issued by the Consejo Mexicano para el Desarrollo Rural Sustentable (Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development), 582,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged, of which 78.03 percent were completely destroyed and the remaining 21.07 percent partially destroyed. Vegetable, maize and chickpea crops were particularly affected.
The decline in economic activity until November has caused unemployment to rise steadily in the Mexican state. The Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía observed a rapid increase in unemployment in the first quarter, because from January to March, 55,053 inhabitants of Sinaloa were unemployed, representing 4.53 percent of the working population. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate rose to 5.28 percent and from July to September to 6.19 percent, resulting in 74,000 unemployed in Sinaloa. This is 18,969 more people than in the first quarter.
Lower liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa that year is due to several factors. The economist Gerardo López Cervantes, Dean of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences at the University of Autónoma (UAS), comments that the policies of public institutions indirectly explain the growing unemployment.
"What we are currently seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors. Among other things, with liquidity losses in the market as a result of funding cuts by legislation passed in Congress to combat money laundering, because it is not easy for those who illegally accumulate dollars to make them work for them, to invest them or to use them for anything else," he explained.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes pointed out that there is also a demographic factor inherent in growing unemployment.
"The number of people leaving the country in search of work abroad, particularly in the United States, has decreased. This is due on the one hand to the entry problems and on the other hand because it is difficult to find work there as well. These people stay here and look for work here, which increases unemployment," he says.
Moonlighting
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more serious when one takes into account the high proportion of undeclared work. According to INEGI, this includes 60.38 percent of employees in the country who work without paying into the social security funds.
In addition to unemployment and undeclared work, there are low wages, the lowest in Mexico, according to statistics from the Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social (Mexican Social Insurance Institution) and the Secretaría del Trabajo y Previsión Social (Government Agency for Labor and Social Welfare in Mexico).
The average monthly income of workers in Sinaloa was 5352 pesos until September; this is much less than the national average, which is 7375 pesos.
Decline in FDI
In addition to the reduction in economic activity and rising unemployment, 2011 saw the sharpest decline in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the last decade. According to the Secretaría de Economía (State Economic Authority), the FDI from January to June was $630,597, a decrease of 87.74 percent compared to $5,143,312 in the same period last year.
For its part, the Secretaría de Desarrollo Económico del Gobierno (Government Agency for Economic Development) recorded a total investment of 17,280,000 pesos in 2011, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In view of the economic crisis, the state government applied to the National Congress in July for a loan of 3,000,000,000 pesos to be invested in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities to reactivate the economy. The national congress approved an amount of 200,600,000 pesos, but until November no positive effects of the debt on any of the economic sectors in the country could be observed.
Reactions
For the representatives of the business community, Mario López Valdé's first year in office made it obvious that he was unable to govern.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the Cámara Nacional de la Industria de la Transformación (State Chamber of Manufacturing Industry in Mexico) stated that in 2011 no efforts were made to harmonize the views of the different sectors, including the national government.
"Economic activity in Sinaloa has been really poor this year. We have to work hard to regain the ground lost this year and in 2012 we have to make a double effort. The efforts of all, and in particular the progress of the already well-coordinated government team, have not been sufficiently coordinated," he said.
Slow economic development
Loredo López said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year hampered and slowed down the country's economic development.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frost. One of the most important impacts is a slowing economy, which is not sufficiently in motion to generate economic dynamism that could generate an acceptable flow of processes, products and services. Therefore, we will close the year far below our expectations," he said.
Redefining vocation
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederación Patronal de la República Mexicana in Sinaloa, said the need to encourage the state to engage in more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we observed that work was being done. We believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program to redefine the economic vocation and line of the country, because it is important to activate all material and human resources of Sinaloa," he said.
There is a lot to do
The chairman of Coparmex stressed the importance of developing a future perspective that better steers the government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the government has achieved good results in various areas. Economic development has progressed, but it is important to develop a long-term program," he said.
He stressed that the current state power had made progress with the government.
"There are areas where you can say that the government has acted more comprehensively. What I can say is that work has been done and that the government is aware that there is still a lot of work ahead of it," he said.
Arrest for 8 kg of marijuana
A Navolato resident was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Republic's prosecutor's office announced that the drug dealer was Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, who was convicted of a public health offense, in this case, possession of marijuana for trafficking.
According to file AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested on 7 June 2010 by Mexican military while monitoring Cipriano Valdez Street opposite Guard Post No. 80 in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving in a white van in which he kept a black bag in a box in the car and on the passenger seat a small backpack in which the military found eight kilos and 23 grams of marijuana.
For this reason, the confiscated goods were handed over to the district judge and the punished person remains in the detention centre.
Debts for construction work
According to Miguel Ángel López Miranda, the social housing for migrants provided for in the Hábitat, Rescate de Espacios Públicos and 3x1 programmes is at risk of not being completed due to lack of funds, or only with a long delay.
The head of the city's social development authority explained that although the construction programs are already advanced, they are now in danger because the state government has not paid the funds due to it, which exceed 11 million pesos for the three programs.
He said the total investment in these three programs was nearly 50 million pesos, 25 percent of which went to the state. So far, only the Federación and the municipality have contributed funds to the construction work, which is why a delay in the completion of construction is to be expected.
"They have to contribute 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny, even though they should have paid us a part in July," he said. "In order not to be late, we have already started the construction work, and it is already well advanced, but we need the money."
He pointed out that under the government of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the state had not fulfilled its obligations, which is why the municipality had to take out a loan of 7 million at the beginning of his reign. That would correspond to the amount that the central government would have had to raise.
"This was already the case in the last legislative period, because the state did not have sufficient economic resources. The programs continued and this year we had to raise the funds that the state had not raised to participate in these programs," he said.
Although the state authorities are obliged to disburse these funds, he commented that the Minister of Administration and Finance has been asked to speed up the administrative work and to pay the outstanding share as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and although the year is already coming to an end, they have not given us a penny."
Court approves transition to digital television in Mexico in 2015
The conversion from analog to digital signals has been one of the most important changes worldwide in recent years.
The Mexican Supreme Court (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional complaints filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which requires the switch from analogue to digital signals to be brought forward from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required to challenge the law.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Supreme Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón had not exceeded his powers when he issued the decree-law detailing the switchover to digital terrestrial television.
With this decision, the constitutional dispute initiated by the Senate was rejected because it did not obtain the necessary qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to decide on constitutionality or non-constitutionality. Thus, the law remains in force.
In the project for the lawsuit, drawn up by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, it was proposed to declare the decree-law unconstitutional, since the Comisión Federal de Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel) (Federal Commission for Telecommunications in Mexico) is responsible for regulating radio and television, so the legislative decree would contradict hierarchical principles and legal reservations.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies lodged constitutional complaints against the legislative decree. Following the adoption of the complaints, Minister Sánchez Cordero ceased to apply the decree-law and ceased all activities relating to the establishment of digital transmission.
The Council of Ministers also rejected the complaint filed by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the debate on the project, for which Minister Sánchez Cordero was also responsible.
In his speech, the Prime Minister expressed that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the state government may not regulate with general regulations the measures that the public administration should take.
"I also don't think that if you did that, the independence of the regulator would be compromised." She also recalled that, for constitutional reasons, the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunications sector, is the responsibility of the central government, which directs state affairs.
The replacement of analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes that has taken place around the world in recent years, and it brings about better use of the radioelectric spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
Postponing the changeover, she said, is a postponement of the benefits of digitalisation, which is a decision in the public interest that does not only have technical aspects, "because it includes economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stressed, "required the action of the entire system, in accordance with the principle of economic management by the state, they included a set of features that the constitution places in the hands of the central government."
She recalled that many countries around the world had already carried out the digital switchover, through the government, even though they had highly specialised facilities.
It cannot be concluded that the government is encroaching on the powers of Congress by issuing the contested decree-law, because the laws passed by the legislature are being respected," she asserted.
The possibility of counting the ballots individually in Michoacán is being considered
According to PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6,074 still to be counted.
The possibility of individual counting of ballots is a reality this year in the elections in Michoacán, because according to the data issued by the Programa de Resultados Electorales Preliminares (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial elections is just under 27 percent, with 879 votes out of a total of 6074 still not counted.
In this sense, the President of the Consejo General del Instituto Electoral de Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just last 9th November the electoral office had adopted a series of regulations harmonizing local regulations with the reforms of the states in electoral matters.
It should be recalled that Michoacán had not adapted his political constitution, his electoral law or his law on electoral justice to the reforms passed by Congress, so that they did not enter into force in this round of elections. Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel avoided publication in the State Gazette within the deadlines laid down for this purpose, arguing that he still had objections to it.
On November 9, Mexico's Supreme Court (SCJN) ruled on the constitutional complaint filed by the local legislature, ruling that the state commissioner's vote on the constitutional reforms was "invalid and unlawful" because he did not have the right to "decide or veto it."
María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained in an interview about the possibility of counting the votes individually that thanks to the adoption of the guidelines by the Consejo General del IEM, it is now possible for the local electoral authority to count all or part of the ballots.
Thus, the votes contained in one or more electoral packages may be partially counted under the following conditions: The results in the minutes do not match; the minutes of the counting and calculation of votes are not available on file or are not in the possession of the chairman of the electoral committee or there are obvious errors or amendments in the minutes.
In addition, the overall counting of the completed ballot papers may take place if there is a difference between the presumed winner and the one in second place that is equal to or less than one percent, provided that at the beginning of the meeting there is an express request by the party or party representative. Coalition leader, who is the second of the above-mentioned candidates.
The counting of votes may also be carried out in its entirety if, after completion of the ordinary calculation, it is determined that the difference between the presumed winner and the candidate in second place is equal to or less than one percent, provided that there is an explicit request from a representative of the party whose candidate came second. In this case, the electoral packages that have been subjected to partial counting would be excluded.
It is worth mentioning that the elections in Morelia are in the same situation, where, according to PREP, the difference between first and second place is just under 0.16 percent, although the votes of 129 out of a total of 923 electoral protocols have not yet been counted.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés trickled down this Sunday evening on Saltillo, his birthplace. On Monday, the funeral examination and a funeral mass took place.
According to family members, the lieutenant colonel's last will and testament was for his ashes to be scattered across the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After a tribute, the family of Bacio Cortés, together with the others killed in the accident, returned to the capital of Coahuila on a plane of the Mexican Air Force. Those closest to the colonel attended the ceremony in Campo Marte.
At twelve o'clock in the afternoon, the lieutenant colonel's ashes landed on the funeral hall on Boulevard Nazario Ortiz Garza, where the family members and friends came.
At 5:30 p.m., his remains were examined at the Technological Institute of Saltillo. This post-mortem was arranged by his former classmates from the technical baccalaureate and his American football team, to which Felipe Bacio belonged during his preparation for the Abitur.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered over the Zapalinamé mountains. That's what he always told his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
From her point of view, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams and she believes that he stood in the fullness of his life. "He was a successful man, exceptional as a father and as a son, a loving brother and he always stood up for his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the town of Saltillo very young to enter the school of the Air Force of Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some couldn't believe it because they thought he would even get dizzy on a truck. Nevertheless, he always strove to realize his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a good person. "He had barely arrived in Saltillo and the whole family wanted to greet him, as on the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man remembers that even at the age of seven he went to Zapopán for the graduation of his family member. That's why he knows his uncle died doing what he liked best: flying a plane.
A last farewell
The Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, was bid farewell with full honors under the leadership of Governor Jorge Torres López. His honor was given to him by the people and the government, the Mexican army of the sixth military area, the Mexican Air Force, headmaster and student of the Technological College of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out as excellent both in studies and in sports.
Bacio Cortés died a few days ago when the helicopter he flew, in which Secretary of State José Francisco Blake Mora and six other people from the same agency were also sitting, crashed.
At 6:05 p.m., the cremated remains of Bacio Cortés, citizen of Saltillo, arrived to be handed over on the forecourt of the barracks by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force, led by Major Jaime Martinez. His family members were already waiting for him there, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, his mother, siblings and other relatives, students and teachers.
The abandoned bodies were found on a plot of land on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military personnel introduced the media to eleven people who had been arrested in the same town in connection with organized crime.
Three men were found murdered by shots in different parts of the body and a mercy shot in an abandoned finca in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The event had taken place at kilometre point 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago at the height of the municipality of El Castillo.
Several passers-by saw that the door of the country house, surrounded by a beige-brown wall, was wide open.
When they looked into the house, they found the bodies of three people about three meters inside, which they immediately reported to the relevant authorities.
One was wearing a yellow T-shirt and dark trousers, without shoes; next to him lay another, dressed in a white top.
Less than a meter away lay the body of another person wearing a red T-shirt and blue pants.
All three were lying on their stomachs.
According to the information obtained at the scene, the three people must have been murdered elsewhere, as no cartridge cases were found.
On the wall of the country house there are inscriptions that one organized criminal gang writes to another, and several bullet holes were found in the wall and door.
11 people arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaría de la Defensa Nacional (Secretary of State for National Defence) presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a gang of criminals mainly active in the town of Cadereyta, who are associated with kidnappings, murder, halconeo (manhunt) and secret funerals.
According to the information made public, eight people were arrested on November 11 in the settlement of Los Alveros and one prisoner was freed.
Three properties and a mobile phone were seized. The detainees confirmed that they were members of the criminal group "Los Zetas".
On November 12 at 06:00 a.m., military officers found a car without license plates with two occupants on their guard lap in the village of Rancho Viejo in Cadereyta.
When inspecting the car, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later, on November 13, at 2 p.m., one of her accomplices was arrested in the municipality of La Frauda, who tried to escape at the sight of the military.
They are accused of secret burials in the towns of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
Formation of the new Italian government on Wednesday
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet the President of Italy tomorrow to present to him the new government to face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic collapse.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet on Wednesday with President Giorgio Napolitano to confirm the formation of the government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mainly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new prime minister will take office.
Monti said he would present to the president the results of talks with the political parties to form a government.
"I would like to reiterate my absolute confidence in our country's ability to cope with these difficult times," the former EU commissioner told journalists.
Monti did not explicitly confirm the formation of the government, but his comments indicate that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well defined," he added.
Monti managed to form a government in less than three days, which is much less time than normal. Meanwhile, Italy is struggling with a political and financial crisis that has pushed the cost of debt to unbearable levels.
The new government, led by former EU Commissioner Monti, must adopt a tough austerity package demanded by euro politicians in order to regain battered confidence in Italy.
The pressure to hurry on Monti was exacerbated by the fluctuating market situation, as a result of which Italian government bonds were burdened with 7 percent interest for 10 years. This corresponds to the situation at which Greece and Ireland were forced to apply for the European rescue package.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of Confindustria, told the press after a meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government to the best of our ability."
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to emerge from this emergency.
Monti's chances of success were greatly increased by the support of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, who was forced to resign on Saturday as a result of the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined to produce good results," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is essential, because so far many of its members have spoken out against a majority technocrat government that Monti is currently forming.
Support from Parliament
Monti's new government needs strong parliamentary support to implement the likely unpopular austerity measures.
Resistance to his efforts or the delay of reforms could once again provoke a devastating attack by financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks is also exerting pressure by pointing out that Monti's failure would be a disaster.
Monti began his debates on Monday with political parties, trade unions and employers' associations, as well as with youth and women's organisations.
The meeting is to be concluded on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed this Sunday by Napolitano, who has launched an extremely rapid change of government in response to the crisis.
After a brief sigh of relief towards the end of last week, when it was announced that Berlusconi would resign, uncertainty over the success of the new prime minister has brought the cost of Italian government bonds back to critical levels.
A rescue of Italy with a national debt of 1.8 trillion euros would be too much for the current EU rescue package.
Monti said his government must last until the next elections, expected to be held in 2013, despite predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement the reforms instead of bringing the elections forward.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the major parties insist that it should consist only of technicians, an indication of their concerns about the procedure imposed by pressure from the financial markets.
Political sources point out that the mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties complicate the inclusion of people from political life.
Spaniards have more opportunities to play than the Ticos
Of the 22 players called up from Spain, ten have over 50 international games under their belt.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 call-ups has 50 games behind him.
A huge difference for Costa Rica when the 22 players from both countries lined up for the friendly match, which takes place today at 15:05 at the National Stadium of San José, are compared.
While the World and European champions, number one in FIFA's monthly ranking, can look back on a considerable number of Class A matches, the three-coloured team has only defender Michael Umana as the only one with over 50 international games.
He reached this number last Friday with the game against Panama (0-2) in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish players, who play in the Liga de las Estrellas (Starliga) and influential clubs of the Premier League of England, have the opportunity every year to participate in numerous home games (League and Cup championships) as well as high-level European Cups such as the Champions League.
In addition, there is the experience with the Spanish fury in complicated elimination matches at the Eurocup and the World Cup.
The Tico footballers, on the other hand, have few international matches within the framework of Concacaf, which is at the bottom of the FIFA rankings.
We will see how the Spanish team pulls out its last stop: goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Saturday against England (defeat 0-1 in London) reached a tie with former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta with 126 appearances abroad.
Casillas will play against the three-coloured team today and Spain will have a new record of 127 foreign matches.
Xavi Hernández, player of the football club Barcelona, owns 106.
Casillas and Xavi even received recognition from UEFA last week, along with others from the Iberian side who had reached the magic number 100: the quoted Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke centre-forward, Raúl González, with 102.
Carles Puyol is also approaching the number hundred with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fábregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
From the side of the Ticos and close to Michael Umana are the left side forward Júnior Díaz with 48 games and the forward Bryan Ruiz with 45.
From then on, only five came to over 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The ones with the fewest games.
Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31) have less than 30 games in the Spanish team.
On the national team's side, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23 have less than 30 games.
The rest are not even approaching the 20 mark.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet made their debuts.
Spain's storied goalkeeper is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz has scored the most goals with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included Costa Rica in its tour to celebrate its twentieth anniversary.
"Playing in Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In the exclusive conversation with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says the band is prepared to play one of their best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
They were expected for more than 20 years, but the band assures that it will be a dream come true for them when they play in Costa Rica.
This was confirmed by bassist and co-founder of the group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva an exclusive interview from Brazil last week.
The band is in the South American part of their tour to celebrate their twentieth anniversary and on Sunday the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
On this day they will perform from 7.30 pm at the National Stadium together with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You are reading an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which can be found in the online edition of La Nación.
For your Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Are you aware of what that means for your fans?
Playing in Costa Rica is a dream that is also coming true for us.
This is only the second time we've played in South and Central America, and so far it's been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once for vacation. It is such a beautiful country that we will definitely stay there for a few more days.
It's exciting for us to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the fans of the band are completely devoted. They experience the days before the concert most intensively.
What do you say to your most enthusiastic fans?
Thank you for standing by our side all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people even think that your concert will be the biggest show of the year.
Doesn't that put a bit of pressure on your visit?
Some of the greatest shows we've done in the last 21 years have happened in the last two weeks.
We played some huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we feel like playing there.
We love this country, we like surfing and are enthusiastic about the jungle. Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
Many of our friends are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo where the waves are just unimaginable.
My friends always went to Costa Rica and Nicaragua for surfing. Together with Mexico, these are excellent areas for surfing. In this way, through people who love surfing, we learned about it.
With a look at the tour you offered huge shows with many songs.
What are your plans for the event in Costa Rica?
Since we have never played there before, we do not set ourselves any limits.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer our fans a good and versatile repertoire.
You never repeat your repertoire.
Why?
I think that's partly because we have nine records and can play over 120 songs. Everyone likes a different song, so the decision which one we will play is not easy.
If we add two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, we can keep our concentration better and they surprise us because they remind us of the reasons why we liked these songs. Otherwise, they could be forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and I think that's why it's for the audience.
With this tour you celebrate your twenty years of history.
Looking back, is it hard for you to believe in your success?
Yes, totally.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined playing in a great rock band for over 20 years. It seems like a dream.
We continue to rely on this blessing and think it's great to be able to make music together even now.
We like each other and are passionate about making music.
We are lucky to be able to go to the places in the world that we have always wanted to visit.
Things couldn't be better.
What did it mean to you to have actively participated in the birth of grunge?
It has always been an honour to belong to this group of great bands.
We are good friends with the folks at Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It is surprising and quite unusual for a movement to emerge from a group of friends.
Every now and then a band emerges from one city, but it's unusual for five or ten groups to come from the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we still play together.
Last year we went to a festival with Alice in Chains and in Canada with Mudhoney and we saw Soundgarden on their tour. We're excited to still be friends with them all, and we're honored to be part of this emerging Seattle sound.
It's also very unusual for a band like yours to stay with the same musicians for so long.
Yes, four of us have been playing together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago. That alone is much more time than many bands survive.
First of all, I believe that we are all lucky to be alive and we also take care of each other.
We are all close friends, which is why musical paths have opened up that give each individual the freedom to experiment.
One trusts the other and his music. We couldn't be better.
Your relationship with fame has not always been easy. On the other hand, thanks to your success, you were always able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
The way we've grown has made it easier for us to find balance.
We make sure not to tour too often, because it's too easy to fall for this game with huge crowds who love your music.
As long as you think that people came for the music, it reminds you that you have to respect the music and what it has created without being obsessed with being a famous rock star. That never interested us anyway.
What memories do you have of your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at the beginning it was great.
We were a band for three years that had never released a record until the death of Andy (Andrew Woods).
We were disappointed to have taken so long. We're still good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. When I hear a song or see photos, I think about what an incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh. It was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person and we miss him.
The domestic band Las Robertas are responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and therefore chose the band for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos of several groups and we liked this band the most. That's why we're curious to see what Las Robertas can offer live. That will certainly be exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics of Yellow Ledbetter when you play live?
That's a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I have no idea.
He sings it, and I think he sings the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influenced you as a bass player?
From so many+
Among the first that comes to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could spend the whole afternoon talking about the bass players I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep grunge alive even though it's no longer a fad?
I think we all don't feel very connected to the word grunge.
When I think about it, the bands I mentioned earlier come to mind, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and everyone else that came up at the same time. If they're still important today, I think that's great, because it's worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever before.
At first her music was darker, now it's more positive.
Why?
That's interesting, because I think there are a few songs on the new album that might seem a bit frivolous. But there are also other songs like The End or Just Breathe that are classified as very dark songs, although they also have something positive about them.
Tears came to both of them when I heard Ed play them. They are very dark songs.
I believe that when you get older and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, when you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic work and your music and these two songs clearly embody that for me.
But I also believe that you can be a happy person and still make dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori came back to the hospital for medical examinations
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to examine muscle loss in his legs, his family doctor informed.
The 72-year-old Fujimori, who is serving 25 years in prison for human rights violations during his reign (1990-2000), has several illnesses, including tongue cancer, who has been operated on four times and is under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, a member of Congress and his personal doctor, told television that Fujimori would be examined for three days at the Instituto Nacional de Enfermedades Neoplásicas, Peruvian hospital, to determine the reason for his pain and muscle loss in the lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion, Fujimori could be pardoned on humanitarian grounds. Nevertheless, he did not want this because he considered him innocent.
He has had four operations on tongue cancer and has lost 18 kilos of weight. In addition, there are other diseases such as severe erosive gastritis, a cyst in the pancreas, kidney stones, high blood pressure and circulation problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in the Dirección Nacional de Operaciones Especiales de la policía since September 2007.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the Peruvian army death squad, which was secretly active during his reign.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political relations
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and consisting of several ministers and entrepreneurs will start their visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two countries and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet his Mexican counterpart Felipe Calderón next Wednesday. According to the Uruguayan president, this will be the culmination of his fully booked schedule with politicians, businessmen and a meeting with the collective of Uruguayans living in Mexico.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara "is suitable for the exchange of information on all policy areas between the two countries," the South American country's presidential office announced on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderón's support over the incident with France, when French Prime Minister Nicolas Sarkozy put the South American country on a list of tax havens at the G20 summit in the French city of Cannes.
In his discourse, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that still act as tax havens. This statement was rejected by Uruguay and prompted a request to its ambassador to the European country.
Since November, Mexico has chaired the G20, a group made up of the world's most powerful emerging and industrialized countries. Since January of this year, there has been an agreement on the exchange of tax information with the South American country in order to avoid double assessment.
In recent years, the government of Uruguay has tried to speed up the concretization of agreements on the exchange of tax information in order to be removed from the "grey list" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). On it are countries that have not introduced all international standards for cooperation in tax matters.
At the business level, a free trade agreement between Mexico and Uruguay has been in place since 2004, which has contributed to a growing exchange of goods between the two countries.
The mustachioed installer enters the third dimension with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to rescue Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never in three dimensions: in Super Mario 3D Land, he fights for the girl's love in stereo technology.
The game, which hits stores around the world this month, has been tailored from the outset to the characteristics of the Nintende 3DS portable console, which allows three-dimensional play without special glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how stereoscopy works without glasses," said Omar Álvarez, head of the Nintendo press in Spain, at the launch of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game from Nintendo that has been developed for this console from the beginning", because until now successful articles such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The spokesperson for Nintendo emphasized that although it is three-dimensional, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "affordable" video game that allows for fast-paced, smooth play.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" includes two games in one: the first part is "lightweight" to capture the less shymed users.
After that, the experts can "turn a second round" over the different game levels, which are becoming increasingly difficult.
Also, users can choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. In order to overcome the obstacles, however, without becoming a victim of the "optical effects", it is always necessary to play three-dimensionally.
Super Mario's foray into the three-dimensional world also means the character's return to a portable console, which hasn't been the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo winks at the fans of the saga and repeats the recipe for success of the last editions: The mustachioed plumber must overcome platforms riddled with dangers to free Princess Peach.
However, the player encounters news in the movements, the environment, the disguises and the enemies - and a "playable" Luigi.
Colom guarantees Portillo's extradition to the United States
Guatemalan President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he would grant the extradition of former Governor Alfonso Portillo to answer for the $70 million conspiracy to launder in the United States.
Thus ends the trial of the US request for Portillo's extradition so that he can be tried there.
In a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the government, taking into account that a court had already ordered the extradition.
He stressed that during his government he had not interfered in court decisions and had granted all extradition requests of which he was informed.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín is extradited for murder and aggravated assault, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom's actions are a government act that takes place when all judicial and constitutional bodies for sentencing the former president of the state (2000-2004) have been exhausted.
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court of Guatemala, Portillo must be extradited once his legal situation in Guatemala has been clarified and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for embezzling 120 million quetzales in the Ministry of Defense during his reign. This trial preceded the extradition, but the minister lodged an objection and revived the case.
Trinijove has helped 6000 young people at risk of social exclusion
The organisation was created to avoid the marginalisation of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of life of the social welfare organisation Trinijove have led to important results: in this quarter of a century, 6000 young people threatened by social exclusion have been supported to find a way out of their difficult situation.
Added to this are the more than a hundred jobs created for this social group.
On the occasion of the anniversary, an event was held yesterday in the former factory buildings of Fabra i Coats, attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in 1986 in the Trinitat Vella district with the aim of helping young people with a low level of education, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu was attended by numerous leaders of institutions and institutions that have worked with the association over these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different tendencies during the election campaign demonstrated the impartiality of Trinijove's work.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parliament of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia), Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the celebrations were attended by former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and former mayor and current left-green councillor Ricard Goma.
The great hall of Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Catalan Minister of Social Affairs and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the General Director of the Social Work of the Savings Bank La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas emphasized that Trinijove was created in very difficult times and that today's times are no less complicated. But he added that the work done so far "is a good foundation."
For the President of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a role model who knows how to fight difficult circumstances and gives hope to people in difficulty.
"The economic crisis is nothing new for the club and the work it does," he said.
Occupied house where huge parties were held was evicted
The homeowners had occupied 11 of the 13 apartments in the building at 51 Balmes Street (Barcelona).
The twelve squatters left the building yesterday afternoon without having put up any resistance.
Everything indicates that the nightmares of the neighbors of house No. 51 on Balmes Street have come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building they had illegally occupied and organized huge parties that had driven the neighborhood to despair yesterday at noon. The eviction was carried out by court order without police intervention.
After the eviction, the door lock was replaced to avoid a similar situation.
"From now on, access will be controlled," confirmed the property manager.
The squatters, who had occupied 11 of the building's 13 apartments - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical system and part of the water supply with them. In addition, they had painted the walls and left behind all kinds of garbage, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
Huge parties were held on the three lower floors, lasting up to two days, driving tenants to despair.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which also suffered damage.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that her business had declined by 80% since the squatting began.
The owner of the discotheque pointed out that the squatters gave her unfair competition, because they sold the drinks for three euros, while they cost 10 euros in the discotheque.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had been reported by the neighbours for disturbing the peace, while, according to her, the noise did not come from the visitors of the disco, but from the squatters and, in particular, from the guests of the parties that were organised there, which, according to the angry neighbours, have become more and more and longer in recent weeks.
The person in charge of the discotheque explained that the harassment was so great that she agreed with the owner of the building not to have to pay rent for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (municipal police) also confirmed that they had received more complaints from neighbours in recent weeks.
The leader of the PP (Partido Popular - People's Party) in the Barcelona City Council, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had demanded last week that the building be evacuated immediately and that the problems of civic coexistence and the deterioration of the district be brought under control.
He explained that before the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but that in recent months the squatters had penetrated all floors of the building and almost all apartments. In some there had even been thefts.
In this sense, he added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and crack down on the anti-social acts in the building."
Yesterday, another building in the Nou Barris district was evacuated by the Catalan police.
At 3:30 p.m., police approached 35 Montral Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who witnessed four people trying to enter the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
Apart from the disputes over the fees, the architects agree with the tender.
The municipal tender for the 16 gates reopens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now disappeared Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this administration published its diatribe about the promotion of Collserola.
The brochure described the mountain as a huge park in Barcelona city.
It has even been compared in numbers to New York's Central Park.
With the demise of the CMB in 1987, the park once again became the upper limit of Barcelona in the eyes of many, because the capital of Catalonia is one of the few that does not spread north-south, but up (mountains) and down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a nature park plays with this idea.
The model was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars in the role of the yogi bear.
This was the case when the city issued a huge tender in September, consisting of 16 competitions, for further access gates to Collserola.
Undoubtedly, a gate refers to the concept of a park.
Either this is the case, or someone intends to put gates in the countryside.
The question arises naturally: Collserola, park or mountain?
The tender is the topic of conversation not only from an organizational point of view, but also in terms of reflection on the city, in the mouths of all architects from Barcelona.
It is almost a recurring theme that two members of this long-established caste who meet in the elevator can fall back on.
And it is precisely this fact that provides the material for one of the rare similarities between what three architects from Barcelona think about it and some university professors who have applied for the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The call is appropriate.
For Roldán, "it is necessary" to talk about the "front on the mountains" after the attack on the coast, as far as the discourse of Ildefons Cerda, the one on the green apples, has not been carried out.
"One should start from the principle that Barcelona's largest park is the beach.
Among other things, because it is easily accessible.
Collserola is more complex," says the architect, for whom the title "Gates of Collserola" contains a "lexical trap": one must not "imagine it as access to a park, but as a delimitation of areas where action must be taken."
Modol, like Roldán and Bayona with urban planning experience, sees the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" that carries "some dangers".
Dangers resulting from the "uncertainty that the design of a public space brings with it today" after the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "swan song" in the area of the Forum.
The first fear is one's own limitation to what may be built.
"To narrow something down always means to determine the next step", i.e. to exceed it.
"You have to think about new urban planning tools, because the current ones [referring to the Plan General Metropolitano (PGM)] can lead to a real disaster."
Modol, who sticks more closely to the question, says simply that the side of Collserola that goes towards Vallesana "can be understood as a park, the one towards Barcelona cannot", for purely topographical reasons.
Modol recalls that there is already a study by the Patronat de Collserola, which should not "fall on deaf ears", although he is grateful to the city administration for giving its committee the opportunity to participate in this project "from the first moment".
In addition, he notes that the proximity of the mountains to the city is the letter of safe conduct that allows architects to participate in the debate, although he expresses his "doubts" as to whether this technical profile should guide the multidisciplinary teams created ("just the right thing," he says).
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question in the title of this article is complex, as the tender conditions lack a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions in cross-section," he says, "on the mountain-sea axis. But there is no longitudinal perspective that looks at the area as a whole."
At least in his case, this has led to him taking part in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, the program and definition of a project for a gate would collide with that of the architect of the gate next to it.
In his opinion, the city should guarantee that the strip directly above the Ronda de Dalt is equipped along its entire length in such a way as to create a soft transition between the city and green zones.
Casino awards Jonás Larrazábal who comes free
After 72 days of silence, the representative of Casino Red freed the brother of the mayor of Monterrey from the trial against him for alleged extortion.
After 72 days in captivity, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after Casino Red's representative forgives him in the district's Second Criminal Court, which is conducting the trial of the brother of the mayor of Monterrey for extortion.
After the attack on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, the owner of Casino Red, published a series of photos and videos showing Manuel Jonás, allegedly forcing him to pay a sum of money so that the city administration approved the secret operation of the betting house.
Following the criminal complaint, the public prosecutor's office opened criminal proceedings against the brother of the panicked mayor, who was arrested for 30 days on September 2.
After four hours with the official of the Ministerio Público 3 en Delitos Patrimoniales, he was taken to Casa de Arraigo 1 in the Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
He remained in this place for 49 days after a second arrest warrant, after the official of the Ministerio Público had rejected the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta detention center for allegedly bribing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos. On the other hand, he only stayed in the middle security wing for a few hours due to death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the trial as an inmate of the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was served with a detention order by the secretary of the district's Second Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez. He stated that after almost two months of investigations, there was sufficient evidence to find Jonás guilty of paying 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the betting house in exchange for opening it.
This Monday, the representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, asked Judge José Luis Pecina to release the mayor's brother from the sentence and he will be released in the next few hours.
During the court hearing, Ramiro Arias, the official of the Ministerio Público assigned to the court, asked García Gómez whether he had repaired the damage and which of the owner of the betting house had expressed his forgiveness. However, the lawyer withheld the name.
In accordance with Case 197/2011, Jonás Larrazábal is acquitted. In the following, too, no objections can be filed against the process, and no damages are claimed.
After hearing the representative of the betting house at around 3:50 p.m., Larrazabal Bretón was immediately released.
The court secretary, Jorge Yánez, went to the municipal prison of San Nicolás de los Garza to inform Jonás that he had been acquitted and that his case would be closed.
He also informed him of the court order for immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash that killed government secretary Francisco Blake and seven other people.
The Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communications and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation into the accident that killed government secretary Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people indicate that the helicopter with its entire intact structure hit the ground without the pilot being able to initiate an emergency landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretary for communications and transport, mentioned that the pilot had confirmed before take-off that the weather conditions had been suitable for the flight.
"The fact that the propeller blades were in contact with trees at a height of 25 meters, with the helicopter losing its fuselage, seems to indicate that the helicopter had had several ground contacts."
He also explained that the helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for transporting the personnel.
In addition, he said that during the investigations in the area where the plane had come down, no helicopter parts were found.
"During the search, no aircraft parts were found elsewhere, the impact affected the entire structure.
The helicopter was built for 19 occupants, which is why it met all the requirements for passenger transport.
The area has a slope of 7 to 30 degrees.
At present, the priority is to receive the results of the investigation as soon as possible, but this could take several months, perhaps even a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director of Aeropuertos y Servicios Auxiliares (Secretariat for Aircraft and Emergency Services in Mexico), assured that the helicopter from the Estado Mayor Presidencial had flown at cruising speed on impact and the aircraft had fallen on a soft slope.
"This information reinforces the assumption that it was a normal flight operation at the time of impact."
At a press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant points that should be taken into account in the investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with flight standards, it was a flight according to the rules of visual flight. This means that the crew should have had sufficient visibility during the flight and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM recorded suitable weather conditions at launch. During the onward flight towards the border area between Mexico City and the Mexico State, some low-hanging clouds gathered.
Selected flight routes:
It is possible that because of the clouds, the crew had chosen a lower area with better visibility towards the Cuernavaca Valley.
Point of impact:
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the helicopter match. There may have been no loss of control over the aircraft or deviation from the flight path prior to the impact.
Scattering the remains of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to date indicates that the helicopter had hit from a straight and lateral direction.
The pattern of the scattered remains of the aircraft suggests that the helicopter with its intact structure had hit the ground.
No evidence of fire or explosion:
The remains of the aircraft at the scene of the accident do not indicate either fire or explosion.
The latest test results indicate several ground contacts.
During the on-site investigations, aircraft parts were found at an altitude of 9200 feet above sea level. The terrain is sloping and has a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the helicopter probably broke.
Some information suggests that the helicopter may have had several ground contacts.
After a meticulous search in an area that went beyond the cordoned-off area at the scene of the accident, no scattered aircraft parts could be found, reinforcing the assumption that the intact aircraft structure had crashed into the ground.
MSS announces research protocol to find the gene for obesity
She is leading a research project to find the gene for childhood and adolescent obesity, supported by specialists from the IPN.
The Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social Insurance Institute of Mexico) announced that it is leading a research project to discover the gene for obesity in children and adolescents entitled "Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence", with the aim of finding the genetic markers associated with overweight.
Miguel Cruz López, head of the Unidad de Investigación Médica en Bioquímica (Department of Medical Research, Biochemistry) at the Hospital de Especialidades del Centro Médico Nacional Siglo XXI explained that an interdisciplinary team consisting of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers has been established.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students at the Instituto Nacional de Salud Pública (INSP) and the Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados (Cinvestav) del Instituto Politécnico Nacional (IPN).
The general public is invited to participate in the study. Interested parties can come to the sports fields of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where tests with children and adolescents are carried out every Saturday from 8.00 am.
He emphasized that the investigation began at the sports field of Cuauhtémoc (in the west of the state of Mexico) and has been continuing since October 8 at the sports field of Nezahualcóyolt (in the east of the state of Mexico).
If the target of 500 to 600 subjects is reached, the study will continue on the sports field of Independencia (in the south of the capital district) and completed on that of Morelos (in the north of the capital district).
He explained that the goal of the study is to learn about the factors and role of genetics in the development of obesity and to identify risk factors of Mexican children and adolescents in the prevention of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of World Diabetes Day, he said the aim was for three thousand children and adolescents aged six to 14 to complete nutrition-related questionnaires with the consent and supervision of their parents.
They are also asked questions about their physical activity and family history to control risk factors that may result in diabetes or kidney failure.
He also explained that on these Saturdays the subjects were measured (weight, height, waist circumference), their blood pressure was checked and blood values such as glucose levels, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin and genetic factors (attempt to identify genes related to childhood obesity) were determined.
Cruz López stressed that this research was carried out in response to health workers' concerns about the alarming weight gain of young people.
"Health surveys conducted in 1999 and 2006 found that in just under six years, the proportion of obese boys increased by 77 percent and that of girls with obesity by 47 percent. Obesity has also risen dramatically," emphasized the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the search for genetic markers was justified because the genetic history of the population of Mexico was different from that of other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican is, on average, 65 percent Indian-American, 30 percent European, and 5 percent African, which is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and obesity.
More generally, he explained that the genetics of obesity are expressed in the inability to burn the excess of energy (calories) we consume, so that it is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the study participants would be a comprehensive examination of the children to determine whether they had a degree of overweight or obesity.
It would even investigate the occurrence of dark skin folds in the neck and on the inner arm (acanthosis), which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disorders and diabetes in the preliminary stage.
All information would be treated confidentially and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. Doctors explain all the measurement results to parents and suggest lifestyle changes that are appropriate to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three basic factors responsible for overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: lack of exercise, i.e. lack of exercise in everyday life, spending most of the day in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
The high calorie intake, that is, an increased consumption of sugared drinks and carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) together with a high fat and protein intake, as well as the genetics to be analyzed in this research project.
Asphalt from the UNAM prevents potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at the Mexican University UNAM, develops asphalts modified with polymers to make the compound more resistant to weather conditions and temperature fluctuations
If attention were paid to the signs emanating from the road surface, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200,000 potholes when the rainy season breaks out in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (urban area of the Valley of Mexico), said Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) at UNAM University, warning and assuring that if the laying and maintenance of the asphalt surface were done appropriately,  the number of potholes can be significantly reduced or even completely avoided.
In his lecture "Potholes from a technical point of view", which he gave on the occasion of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing asphalts modified with polymers to produce a mixture similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera said that this type of modified asphalt should be used in areas with extremely hot climates, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve the behaviour of the road surface and thus avoid the occurrence of potholes.
He explained that the asphalt - the heaviest part of petroleum - is a hydrocarbon compound, one part of which has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphaltenes - and the other part a low one - the so-called malthenes. Together, they give the road surface its characteristic viscoelastic behaviour.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt means that it behaves like a liquid at high temperatures of almost 180°C, very viscous at 120°C and almost solid at 50°C, while it becomes brittle at very low temperatures.
"This means that the resistance of the asphalt on the roads is not uniform, but changes in one day depending on weather conditions and temperature fluctuations," explained the chemical engineer.
The FQ researcher noted that the streets of Mexico City mostly have a flexible road surface composed of six layers of material, the last three of which contained asphalt.
Between the uppermost layers lies a layer of asphalt wear consisting of small stones bathed in asphalt and then solidified.
Every single stone of this wear layer was bathed in asphalt.
When the vehicles move on it and forces are generated, this layer allows a good distribution of forces in the road surface.
"If it were modified asphalt, the forces would be distributed even better," said the chemical engineer.
"Above the wear layer," he explained, "a final layer is laid out, the so-called base layer, which consists of tiny stones, i.e. sand that has also been bathed in asphalt.
Since this layer is in contact with the vehicle tires, they require greater mechanical force than the wear layer and it must create friction.
Since this road surface receives and distributes the most forces, the base course also needs an adequate thickness and the material it is made of must be maintained.
Weather conditions, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are other important factors to consider, especially water," he said, "because it significantly affects the behaviour of the wear layer.
When the terrain becomes damp, water enters the layer and is difficult to escape. This causes a softening of all layers of the road surface and, as a result, the appearance of potholes.
When a pothole occurs," he said, "the surface layer is removed first, while the wear layer is only affected afterwards. But the damage is not immediate, it is a process that should be maintained at the first sign by appropriate maintenance programs."
The member of the Sistema Nacional de Investigadores (National Research System of Mexico) explained that the vehicle load is another important cause of the occurrence of potholes. Therefore, the thickness of each layer of road surface must always be proportionate to the vehicle load and it must be ensured that this regulation is complied with in order to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that there was still a lot of research to be done, for example on asphalt emulsions, which were already on the market in other countries, and with which potholes could be repaired easily and without the use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate del Valle missing to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that affected Melina Ramírez Serna not getting the crown of Miss Colombia.
El Valle receives its 14th Misstitle.
Once again, Valle del Cauca came away empty-handed in awarding the crown to Miss Colombia.
This time, Melina Ramírez Serna had to settle for standing on the winners' podium, displaying a silver crown and the ribbon identifying her as the new Miss Colombia.
With the result obtained this night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico took the crown and cedar, the department already has 14 mistitles and Melina joins the legion of women from Valle del Cauca who had almost held the crown in their hands. Among the proclaimed Misses are: Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many are asking themselves today is: What was missing?
Because the result corresponds to the decline of a great favorite who had shown at every screening that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia. It was not for nothing that she had been elected Queen of Police and Mejor Rostro Jolie by Vogue, titles that had also been given to beauty queens Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, who took home the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor considered decisive for the jury's decision to nominate her First Miss is that she was not convinced by the answer to the question "Which book influenced you the most and why?", which had been put to her by Martín Murillo Gómez of Carreta Literaria Leamos.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca replied to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a bit in literature, I think it's a way of civilizing, ultimately I think that the book that shaped my childhood the most is 'The Little Prince', a pretty deep book.
At the moment I am reading 'Crime and Punishment'. It is a book of universal culture that we should all read. I'm reading a book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called 'Passions'.
An answer that met with little approval, firstly because of the term 'civilise' and secondly, because she had not explained concretely how each book she mentioned had influenced her.
But at the conclusion of the ceremony, Melina declared that she felt calm and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, it happens what must happen.
And for all people: Please read a bit of 'The Little Prince'. It's a great book.
Among other things, it is said that the darling of El Valle is burned out.
A journalist from Bogota suggested that the fact that she was the favourite, who received all the applause and who had received all the prizes in advance (Oster gastronomy competition, public vote for the best handmade costume and Reina Madre), "made the other candidates jealous, which stressed the queen, who could not shine on stage."
And this was noticeable at her first performance in a swimsuit on the beach of the Hilton Hotel and at her two elevators at the coronation ceremony.
Although she performed confidently in both, she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico showed.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en casa" at the channel RCN said that the fact that Melina was crowned Miss "shows that the candidate who wins the most prizes during the competition will not become queen after all".
In addition, Valle avoided the press at the end - a mistake.
Another hypothesis is that Valle could not convince the jury about her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Pageant.
There must be a reason why two days before the international jury was assembled, Lucy Doughty declared that they were looking for a woman who was committed to the social affairs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia. You have to look beyond the physical and focus on the social feeling, on the fact that she had already worked on projects before participating in the competition," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle had sinned with her defects of derriere and fibrosis, which were noticed in her stomach area. But this is contradictory, because the jury chose her as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good eating habits and responsible physical work.
The Queens' coach, Jorge Hernán Orozco, admits that Melina didn't have the best body, that there were better ones, "but her problem with abdominal fibrosis, which was frankly barely noticeable to me, depressed her score on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the mistake of the woman from Valle del Cauca was the surgical procedures she undertook.
"The surgeries are ok, but Valle didn't know how to get them done right.
Her body has never been her strong side, and she had to pay for that job."
Because of this prize, which is awarded for the first time by the National Beauty Contest, a gruesome prediction was made after the performance in a swimsuit, which was to come true at night. It was whispered that Raymundo had given Melina a consolation prize so as not to let her enjoy the crown.
Whether this is true or not, the fact is that Melina begins her reign today, not as queen but as princess, a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia at one of the international competitions upon appointment of the National Beauty Pageant.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who escaped the crown despite her overwhelming performance for Cartagena.
Such was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lophoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who identified "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials plays a key role.
Last November 4, a laphoscopist from the Investigation Unit of the Public Prosecutor's Office (CTI) from Cali arrived as the man who confirmed the identity of the leader of the FARC (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia): "Alfonso Cano" by comparing fingerprints.
Of the seven laphoscopists in the CTI department, Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been involved in criminal investigations for 21 years, was on call this week.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in communities of Chocó, where he often had to go into the jungle for five days to reach the place where the bodies he was supposed to identify were.
In 2000 he moved to Valle and after completing the necessary courses, he specialized in lopphoscopy, which is the examination of the skin exposed to friction, i.e. the palms and feet.
In the week of the operation against the so-called Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was advised to pack clothes for at least three days.
Something big awaited him.
Friday night he flew by helicopter from Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he was to identify two bodies, and that there was a suspicion that one might be that of the man who had led the oldest guerrilla in the world. Therefore, he should take the ten-finger impression sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name) with him.
However, when he reached the place where the body was located, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, which did not resemble the images he had seen in the mass media.
He had no beard, was dressed like a local farmer, wore no glasses, and was much thinner.
But fingerprints don't lie.
Armed with a magnifying glass, ink, a trowel and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the imprint sheet.
He had seen correctly: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, this man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of informing the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was indeed the head of the FARC.
In search of clues
For a dactyloscope from the Sijín in Cali, the tribute paid by President Juan Manuel Santos Eliazar González at a press conference on the mission against "Cano" was very important.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science with no error rate, which can be a key factor in resolving a crime.
Lophoscopists not only identify corpses, they also support investigations into murders and robberies and confirm the identity of the arrested persons.
When arrested, many offenders present false identity documents or they do not have any.
We take their fingerprints and search for them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to tear a piece of wall out of a house during a theft, because the thief had propped himself up with his hand at this very spot when he pulled out a safe stuffed with jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult because their surfaces are unsuitable for fingerprinting. But in this case, we were able to take the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender who had participated in several thefts," he recalled.
With the help of fingerprints, murder suspects can also be exonerated or incriminated.
Recently, a dead man was found surrounded by liquor bottles.
During the investigation, it was suspected that a family member might be a suspect, and indeed a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
Although this does not guarantee that it is the murderer, it is associated with the place where the crime was committed.
A CTI dactyloscopist explained that "the fingerprints would be taken from the object using chemical or physical reagents."
When they appear, a plant trowel or ribbon is used to take away.
After that, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the civil registry office.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians without identity papers," explained the expert from CTI.
He said that not everything was as it was portrayed in the TV series SCI.
Just as not everything you glitter is gold, not everything you touch is a fingerprint.
But it can still be used if you make an appropriate comparison.
The "indignant" challenge the authorities in New York
Hundreds of demonstrators huddled together in tents in Zuccotti Square.
Most of them complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Ocupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities this Tuesday when they again tried to enter Manhattan Square with a court order after being cleared of the square at dawn and attempting to occupy another square in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of demonstrators huddled in front of Zuccotti Square, to which they wanted to gain access with a court order allowing the "indignant" to camp again at this point. Meanwhile, another part of the movement complied with the eviction order and occupied a park further north in the city, where nine arrests were made.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square, we'll get together somewhere else and continue the battle by legal means to return to the Zuccotti, with sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the spokesmen for the Ocupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the response of the "indignant" to the eviction of their tent camp, which had been ordered directly by Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, came to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forcible eviction of the square and allowing protesters to camp.
In addition, the "indignant" occupied a new park located at the intersection of central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by Trinity Church.
They could occupy the place for at least an hour. But after that, the police arrived and arrested some of the protesters, although Bray cannot give exact figures. He assured the Efe news agency that he had seen several journalists handcuffed.
The organization asserts that hundreds of people had gathered at this place, where a delegation of religious leaders had also arrived as a sign of their support for the members of the movement and for mediation with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square (a privately owned site) remains closed pending a judicial hearing scheduled for Tuesday to analyze the legality of the eviction that took place at dawn.
Some of the protesters driven from the square carried photocopies of this court order and distributed them. They even gave them to some policemen guarding the square, resulting in "some small clashes," according to Bray, who had reported that some policemen had beaten protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating members of Occupy Wall Street from the square, as well as the application of "laws passed after the occupation and prohibiting protesters from returning to the park with their tents and other items they had previously used."
Mayor Bloomberg makes it clear to the press that due to this court order, the reopening of the square to the public and the demonstrators has been lifted. He pointed out to the protesters that city laws did not allow them to re-establish tents and sleeping bags in this place.
The mayor personally defended the eviction of Zuccotti Square at dawn, in which almost 200 people were arrested, and which was decided because the protesters "violated the law."
Bloomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the square because it had "turned into a place where people came not to demonstrate, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm others," because "some shops had received threats" and residents feared "for their quality of life."
"The eviction at dawn was disgusting and shows that Bloomberg is basically interested in protecting financial interests rather than protecting the interests of North American workers," added the movement's spokesman, who accused the mayor of "not respecting press freedom."
Occupy Wall Street officials said they were considering organizing "big actions" for Thursday, along with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months that the protests have lasted since September 17.
Pamela Anderson is the Virgin Mary in the TV Christmas show
Along with Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, she will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement," lifeguard in "Baywatch," rabbit on "Playboy," the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a Christmas show on Canadian television.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with "crooner" (ballad singer) Michael Bublé and other Canadian celebrities, will appear on the TV program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1, breathing life into a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today broadcast images of the television program in which Anderson - who is also responsible for distributing on the Internet a homemade porn in which she appears together with her former husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee - appears as the Virgin Mary with a doll in her lap that is supposed to represent Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Native American descent who recently worked as a host on Charlie Sheen's show "My Violent Torpedo of Truth," appears as the baby Jesus.
CTV's Christmas program relies not only on Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires at the end of March, and who is not far from this controversy.
Recently, Bublé had called the North American Kim Kardashian a "whore" at one of his concerts in New York.
Japan is reborn after the earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption, ending the spiral of free fall from the beginning of March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to a nuclear crisis and the worst disaster Japan had experienced during World War 2.
The first estimates of the government in Tokyo put the property damage at 300,000 dollars, a blow that seems to be diminishing despite the difficult world economic situation.
After three quarters of cases, the data on gross domestic product from July to September finally served to close this chapter: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% compared to the annualized ratio.
The figure measured in the second quarter - in Japan the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also represents the fastest growth since the period from January to March 2010.
The recovery can be partly explained by the sale of machinery for the reconstruction of the areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investment by 1.1% compared to the 0.9% decline in investments recorded from January to March, the first decline in six months of unstoppable increases.
Nevertheless, the real turnaround of the Japanese economy is not based solely on Keynsian impulses that use the crisis to build or rebuild infrastructure.
Japan has woken up in particular thanks to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by growing spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market after the yen - the Japanese currency - moved into one of the "safe haven currencies" of investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the gloomy forecasts for the U.S., a privilege that weighs like a tombstone on the accounts of export companies.
With a harder currency, products abroad are more expensive, a serious problem for a country whose economy relies on the health of the big tech producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak financial results from July to September to the quotation of the yen.
While markets continue to besiege peripheral EU countries, the Yoshihiko Noda government remains vigilant.
"You have to pay attention to the ongoing risks, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen," Motohisa Furukawa, Secretary of State for Economic Policy, said yesterday.
The prospects are really not very cheerful.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clearer signs of a slowdown in economic development in September.
The indicator, which anticipates the turning points of the world economy, brought to light that the brakes would have been pulled on the largest economic powers.
Because it fell by four tenths to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The eurozone is even below this average, which stands at 100, after falling by eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says austerity measures will be passed, but conservatives won't sign a written deal
With the peripheral countries' risk premia soaring and uncertainty spreading, Greece continues to get lost in the maze that leads out of the great European debt crisis.
The impression that the "consensus" of the new Greek transitional government is more a reaction to pressure from Brussels than a genuine conviction of the political forces is slowly being backed up by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday pointed out that there were no alternatives to structural reforms and that the hundred days agreed upon when he was appointed might be too short for their implementation, the leader of the conservative Nueva Democracia party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he supported the new austerity measures and not his call for new elections on the scheduled date.  on 19 February.
"The most important task of this government is to implement the decisions taken at the summit on 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday at the opening of a parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new government.
A package of 24 programmes to promote employment, reform of disciplinary legislation for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion are the first initiatives.
Nevertheless, Samara's statement does not dispel doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to supporting the transitional government, but nothing else."
The conservative leader went a step too far with his challenge to the EU and the IMF, the organism that must unlock the 8,000 million that Athens desperately needs. He made it clear that he would not endorse any commitment to the implementation of austerity measures.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the impact of the Papandreu referendum poker, reiterated yesterday that its demand could not be shaken: the economic aid would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties did not sign "a clear written agreement as soon as possible."
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said that Troika inspectors would return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth stage" of 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date yet.
The Greek tangle still has threads for a while.
Queen Sofía: "These are instruments of progress and hope"
The Queen stressed Spain's "dominant" position in relation to this type of financing
Spain "has achieved a dominant position in the world in the role of micro-finance".
Queen Sofía of Spain recalled yesterday that Spain has become the second donor in the world for this means of international cooperation in the last two decades. Its "essence" is based on the fact that it is an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity based on trust in man".
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Summit on Microcredit in Valladolid yesterday. She was convinced that there was "no doubt" that this type of business would be "absolutely essential" to achieve the millennium goals set by the United Nations by 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people living on incomes of less than a dollar a day, i.e. below the poverty line".
Spain "continues to work" to extend the beneficiary network "to the furthest corner of the world and it carries out this task responsibly", noted Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that will come from the summit, which runs until Thursday, will be guaranteed "the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest and especially for women" as the main beneficiaries of these loans.
"We have had many successes" and "face many challenges."
The Summit on Microcredit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform for initiating "two fundamental objectives".
The Queen said the aim is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for ten million of these households to cross the poverty line.
The concept of microcredit in Spain and the rest of the world goes back to the path initiated by Muhammad Yunus "years ago", which Queen Sofia judges as an "act of justice and recognition".
She described the father of this financial instrument as an "admirable idealist dedicated to the fight against poverty" and whose work she had known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn about the lending strategy on the ground.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and further meetings in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999 and Canada in 2006. In all of them, "we have seen continuous development", declared the Queen, whose commitment to this project earned her the rating yesterday as "head of the family" in Valladolid and as an "advocate for the poor".
Finally, Queen Sofia concluded her speech by encouraging those present to participate in the debate and to seek solutions in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
Spanish Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez pointed out that solidarity is "an ethical imperative" for the entire democratic state.
In this sense, she stressed that it was a mistake to tie development aid to times of economic boom because it was a 'permanent commitment'.
Jiménez was of the opinion that micro-credit was a "serious and rigorous policy to eradicate poverty" and that the governments of the industrialized countries must now "more than ever" work according to solidarity criteria, and not allow solidarity to fall victim to the crisis.
For Spain, microcredit is one of the "most important forms of development aid".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "hope" to "marginalized" people "who are always in front of closed doors" and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present in a city that "opens its doors, infected by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the EU president by universal vote
The first day of the Congress of the Christian Democrats (CDU) on Monday, November 14 in Leipzig went without any real difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and leader of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally envisaged in the programme, but prevailed in the autumn, especially to satisfy those activists who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and possibly Italy tomorrow to be too lax.
The European Commission's request for a presidency proposed by the Bureau was adopted almost unanimously.
Out of 1001 delegates, only nine had voted against, ten had abstained.
The standing ovation lasting several minutes, which was first directed at Angela Merkel and a few hours later Wolfgang Schäuble due to their intervention decrees, left no doubt on the part of the three pro-European finance ministers.
The Chancellor's main idea, like the motions, bears the following slogan: the answer to the crisis is "not less, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because "nine million jobs are directly dependent on the euro".
For the Chancellor, "the time has come for a breakthrough in Europe."
This could be reflected in a modification of the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the budgetary policies of countries in the euro area, which reinforces the control of the European Union; but this could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of universal suffrage "to give Europe a face".
However, this is in any case one of the proposals passed by Congress, which was clearly inspired by Wolfgang Schäuble.
Certainly, it is unlikely that the 47 will quickly agree on this revolution: Britain is opposed to the cause, and the leaders of the CDU believe they know that Nicolas Sarkozy agrees.
However, the milestone has been set.
Similarly, an overwhelming majority of delegates rejected the proposal to weight each country on the ECB's Executive Board according to the weighting of individual economies, which would obviously strengthen Germany's position.
The Chancellor, who is keen to calm the climate within her party, has therefore strengthened the points of reference to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. However, it no longer tried to win its congress at the expense of the "small" or troubled European countries, which would immediately criticize arrogant Germany.
Insofar as the motion for Europe devotes a paragraph to the significance of the "german-French friendship", Angela Merkel does not call France onto the scene.
At least not directly.
Because this reminds us that Leipzig was at the center of a bloody battle two centuries ago.
In fact, one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What does sick leave fraud represent?
After the family benefits, UMP and the government are now tackling sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 November to visit a family allowance fund and give a speech on the theme of combating social fraud and economic dependence on the State, which has been recurring since 2007.
In order to accompany this attack, which stems from the desire to put the economy to the test, but on the other hand is no less a harbinger of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to concentrate on workers' sick leave.
Firstly, with budgetary objectives: the government envisages the introduction of a fourth waiting day before taking into account sick leave for employees in the private sector.
In good German, this means that a sick employee would lose the salary of four days without permission from the specific company, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure which, according to the daily newspaper "Les Echos", threatens to provoke anger, but which would help to bring in 280 million euros.
And which would go hand in hand with another measure of a more symbolic nature: granting civil servants an unpaid waiting day in the event of illness (so far, unlike the three waiting days in the private sector, there is no waiting period for them).
While these questions are under discussion, the majority are also rekindling the issue of fraud, this time targeting the abuse associated with absenteeism.
"Controls will be much more important, and in addition, they will have to be reimbursed if this is requested," Xavier Betrand warned on Sunday, November 13, in front of the microphone of the broadcaster RTL.
As in other cases, the impact of this report seems somewhat disproportionate to the reality of fraudulent activity in the area of sick leave.
In fact, since 2002 this has been the subject of constant monitoring and political offensives, which have borne fruit most frequently.
The French are no longer sick more often than people elsewhere in Europe.
However, let us first dwell on the national figures.
According to the national health insurance fund CNAM, more than 237 million euros in daily severance payments were paid out in 2006.
According to the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health Care, daily severance payments accounted for 11.3 billion euros in 2008, 5% of health expenditure.
This amount included 46% for maternity leave and accidents at work and 54% for sick leave, i.e. 6.2 billion euros.
And therefore 2.5% health expenditure.
In 2010, the French were granted an average of only 14.5 sick days compared to the 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting Group.
An average that masks certain differences: another, published in 2007 by Monster.com, career planning website, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single sick day.
Another study, this time covered by health insurance, makes it clear that 37% of sick leave in 2010 was of less than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11% above.
Compared to their European neighbours, French workers are therefore no more prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two researchers from the French National Centre for the Study of Science (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global absenteeism rate (due to illness or otherwise) oscillated, ranging from 10% to 11% in France against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave represents a negligible proportion of undeclared work.
As far as fraud is concerned, only a weak level is achieved here.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 means that there are systematic controls on sick leave exceeding 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million checks, the CNAM (Public College for Training and Further Education of Technicians and Engineers) found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term sick leaves, i.e. in 37,050 cases, were "unjustified or too long".
Among the systematically controlled sick leave cases lasting more than 45 days, 11% of 1.2 million cases were "non-conformist or unjustified", i.e. 132,000.
In total, this makes 169,000 "unjustified" cases for several million workers who have claimed sick leave.
A figure that represents only a weak extent compared to, for example, that of undeclared work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a factual report on this issue published in July, this represents between €9 billion and €15 billion in lost tax profits per year, i.e. more than the total cost of daily pay, and thus much more than the defrauding of the latter.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adjustment plan
Greece needs a new adjustment program to absorb its economy.
This was announced to Parliament on Monday 14 November by Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, adding that the one hundred days granted to his government by the Union were not enough to carry out this task.
"In order to continue efforts to strengthen the economy, we need support from our European partners and a new budget adjustment programme," the head of government said in his first public speech at the opening of the debate on the Parliament's vote of confidence on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Euro Summit on 27 October was the 'main task' of the new government, as the country's participation within the euro area was 'at stake', he added.
Accordingly, M. Papademos has planned to reduce the country's public deficit "by 9%" of gross domestic product from today until the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects the new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, head of the right wing, had on Monday given his approval to the measures already approved for an attempt to escape the debt crisis, but said that his party would not agree to an additional austerity measure.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said at a meeting of his New Democracy party.
He had agreed to reduce the budget deficit and debt, as well as to fight waste, but was hostile to any policies that would prevent economic recovery.
Olli Rehn, EU Commissioner in charge of economic and monetary affairs, who had prevented the IMF and the EU from not releasing the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without a written guarantee from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras had replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under pressure from outside.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, according to a panel of experts
Canadians live in denial of death, according to a report by the Royal Society of Canada
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors are working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving remedies, beyond cancer cases.
Canadian society lives in an attitude of denial of death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually agree to talk to their doctor about conditions under which they want to die and make arrangements for this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which involved six experts linked in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This body recommends that the government amend the penal code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia where this choice arises, for patients who are considered capable of making such a decision.
As a prelude, the experts cite a recently published survey by the independent society EIU, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that "medical euthanasia in Canada has created a culture where people are afraid to raise the issue of death."
Medical care or not: 77% of Canadians do not have access to painkillers, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the majority desire of Canadians to die at home, 68.6% of them ultimately die in hospital.
Across the country, the rate of 86% hospital deaths is highest in Quebec.
On the thorny issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that run counter to the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to make any changes to the penal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, however, according to the experts who have equally inspected all those countries whose approach has legalized or decriminalized euthanasia and assisted suicide, there is no evidence that such decriminalization would lead to misuse in their application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide of incompetent or non-consenting persons.
On the contrary, there are many more cases of such violations in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalized, as Jocelyn Downie, co-signatory of the report, confirmed yesterday in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Assisted suicide is also practiced in Canada, although clearly illegal here," explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians advocate euthanasia
Remember that according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010, 85% of Canadians had already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, believing that it allows people at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia does not convey the message that the lives of elderly or disabled people have less value.
With regard to people who have already committed assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
As far as maintaining or discontinuing drugs in patients is concerned, the situation is less clear, according to the authors of the report.
They also suggest in their list of recommendations that the criminal law should state that the withdrawal of funds for which there has been a valid refusal should not be regarded as criminal.
The panel of experts also calls for health professionals to be trained to respect end-of-life withdrawals without fear of prosecution.
The panel explained that governments, health care institutions and doctors are working together on pain-relieving treatment to provide the best pain-relieving agents, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to the means of pain relief or life-ending measures already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Panel calls for at least consideration to be given to them, as they do not serve to reduce physical pain any more than euthanasia and relate to the same procedures.
Reservations of other experts
Some experts in the field of public health have already expressed reservations about the conclusions of the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, described the attitude of the report-signing experts as "extreme", as it sets no limits to the practice of euthanasia among sick people in the final phase.
"This opens the doors to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and older than 18 years asks another person to help him commit suicide," said Deschamps, who reviewed a summary of the report yesterday.
Attorney Deschamps also emphasizes that the authors of the report seemed to place individual ownership above all other values involved in the social fabric of society.
Now, he says, there are "guidelines and obligations in a society."
Margaret Somerville, a specialist in health law, has also expressed "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she dubbed a 'pro-euthanasia manifesto'.
In particular, Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Society of Canada, questions the reporting data regarding the absence of abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan calls on President Assad to step down from power
Damascus denounces 'plot'
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar al-Assad's partisans demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry authorities.
Diplomatic pressure on Bashar al-Assad's Syria, which, thanks to Russia's support, is resisting it and rejecting a "plot" against the country, intensified yesterday.
Two days before the exclusion of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened its sanctions against Damascus, despite the fact that Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, had taken a position in favour of President Assad's departure.
King Abdullah II Jordan yesterday was the sitting Arab prime minister who called on President Bashar al-Assad to "resign his power in Syria," in which some forty civilians and members of government power have already been killed.
"If Bashar cared about his country's interests, he would step down, but he should also create the necessary conditions for a new era of Syrian political life," the King of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish diplomatic chief Ahmet Davutoglu complained that the Turkish mediation attempts directed at the Syrian regime since the beginning of the year had not been crowned with success.
"Those in the Middle East who are not at peace with their people and cannot satisfy them must go," he said, alluding to Syria, the neighboring country to which Turkey is taking an increasingly harsh stance.
For its part, the United States welcomed the "intensification of the consensus against Assad and the machinations of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and countries like Turkey have adopted an increasingly harsh tone in the face of repression in Syria," said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the state department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of government power have died in the Dar'a region of southern Syria, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians were killed in "gunfire exchanges and heavy bombings around Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, according to the NGO.
At a press conference, Syrian Foreign Trade Minister Walid al-Muallim said the country was "heading for the end of the crisis."
He has also reacted forcefully to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which he considers to be a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not give in," he added, asserting that "the plots forged against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is now investigating a "protection mechanism for civilians" and wants 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, the media and military observers to be sent to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Trade, Alain Juppé, had also spoken out in favour of sending UN observers to protect civilians from repression by the regime, which encapsulates itself in its "paranoia".
An unscheduled new meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on November 2, but in particular the controversial and expected withdrawal of military troops from the besieged cities and the liberation of imprisoned demonstrators.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov yesterday described the Arab League's decision as "incorrect" in order to be wary of advocating possible sanctions against Damascus, even though China had already urged Syria to implement the crisis exit plan.
Italy
Monti calls on markets to be patient and Italy to sacrifice
Mario Monti, Italy's future head of government, has asked the markets for a little more time to form his staff and implement a programme that demands "sacrifices" in order to regain the creditworthiness lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former EU Commissioner held a hearing with the political parties yesterday ahead of today's meeting between trade unions and employers.
It was his job to convene a cabinet in parliament composed relatively strictly of external technocrats.
"Monti spoke of an important programme with a number of victims," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many smaller parliamentary groups participating in the talks, after meeting the President-in-Office of the Council.
For his part, Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of Deputies, had promised Mario Monti to give Parliament a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The agreements will culminate in the presentation by M. Monti of a list of deletions, which will undoubtedly range from a dozen ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
M. Monti commented that yesterday's nervousness of the stock exchange and bond markets demanded its time.
In "a democracy, there are certain deadlines" to prepare a government and a government programme, he stressed, noting that it was "certain that the markets will be tolerant and reasonable".
His appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets, but the unrest had intensified again, especially after an unexpected decline in industrial production in the eurozone in September.
The incumbent prime minister should set up a staff consisting mainly of technocrats, although he had stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should only last until 2013, the date of the next parliamentary elections, he estimated.
According to Gianfranco Fini, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, the new government should receive the vote of confidence of the parliament by Friday.
Since taking up his post, M. Monti has committed himself to working as a matter of urgency towards the goal of making Italy a "new protagonist" in Europe.
A spokesman for EU Commissioner Olli Rehn had stressed that "our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change, even taking into account the new government".
In particular, the EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its goal of balancing the budget in 2013 despite the austerity plans taken up in recent months, has requested new hardship measures.
Emma Marcegaglia, "head of the bosses" of Italy, who will meet Monti on Tuesday, also insists on the need to stimulate the economy, "because a country that has no growth at all cannot respect the deficit indicators".
M. Monti, who is known for his competence and his independence as EU Commissioner (1994-2004), stands for an "epochal change" of Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes the "challenge of trustworthiness" as well as a "different Italy," according to the editorialists.
The big unknown here is the longevity of his staff.
President Napolitano would like to prevent early elections, as Italy has to pay for 200 billion euros in government bonds from now until April 2012.
Russian scientist helps Iran's nuclear energy program
A Russian scientist, Vyacheslav Danilenko, has helped Iran develop a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in nuclear risks confirmed on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS bases the result on the recently published report of the International Agency for Atomic Safety AIEA as well as other documents emanating from this UN agency to identify this scientist.
The AIEA last week expressed its "serious concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to detailed study of the AIEA documents by ISIS, Danilenko, born in 1934, had apparently worked for over three decades in a Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Urals) since the beginning of the 60s and was involved in the explosion-generated production of synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991 he is said to have left the center to found a company in Kiev that produces "nano-diamonds".
The economic difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Before returning to Russia, he then worked on an Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the AIEA mentioned "strong indications that Iran's development of a nuclear explosives system" had been aided by the work of a foreign expert who was not only highly skilled in this technique, but also, as a state official told the agency, had spent his entire professional career working on this technology directly on the military nuclear energy program of his country of origin."
Anti-Islamic crimes and offenses have increased by 50%
Crimes and offenses against Muslims increased by 50% from 2009 to 2010, while other racially or religiously motivated violent crimes either decreased slightly or increased only slightly over the same period, according to FBI statistics released Monday.
According to these data, the total number of violent crimes committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. by 49%, while there was a 13% increase in violent crimes against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" rose to 6,628 cases at a very low rate, including 47.3% motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a slowdown in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and offenses grow again," Human Rights First said. The increase in anti-Islamic violence is particularly significant," the organization added in a communiqué.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," added Paul Legendre, an organization's official.
"The American government can and should do more to combat these attacks," he added, noting that this could be done by improving police attitudes toward "hate crimes."
The "hate crime" in US federal law presents itself as a legacy from the era of the struggle for civil rights.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence directed against race, color, religion or descent and now also includes crimes of sexual affiliation.
Twitter is transforming the platform and resembling Facebook more and more
Microblogging site Twitter introduced changes to the presentation of its platform on Monday to allow its users in particular to monitor the activity of those who follow its posts, making the service once again similar to that of Facebook.
The new "Activity" tab and another "Name" allow you to better understand the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet users whose messages ("tweets") you follow and who follow your messages.
This makes it possible to find out if they allow them to follow their messages, subscribe to new posts, favor certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer had been tested before its general Internet distribution on Monday "in August with a small percentage of users," Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told the French press agency AFP.
Twitter was known for its instinctive functioning, filled with somewhat esoteric-seeming wording (RT for referencing another person's contribution). followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi a un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable a celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
In the network, users debated this innovation with the help of certain "tweets" via the Internet.
"This is useless, intrusive and too much like Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature will help me better track certain elements of my Flux Twitter," @dannykronstrom said.
Austria
Entry of a "Golden Budgetary Rule" in the Constitution
The government of the grand Social Democrat/Christian Democratic coalition in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include a "Golden Budget Rule" in the constitution in order to reduce public deficits and also avoid possible degradation by rating agencies in Austria's top credit rating (AAA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision of the outcome of the Council of Ministers, although the public public debt of Austria stands at 74.6%, i.e. far above the criterion of 60% laid down by the Maastricht Treaty, but well below the debt level of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency had not fallen from AAA to AA+ in one fell swoop, we would have to pay an additional three billion euros in interest every year," argued Michael Spindelegger, Vice-Chancellor and Christian Democratic Foreign Minister.
Austria also acceded to a demand made by the Brussels summit of euro area member states on 26th October that the heads of state and government had demanded the inclusion of the reduction of public deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to public balance in the constitution or by enacting an equivalent law.
The action taken by the Austrian government is similar to the 'German model', since Germany was the first European country to include such a 'rule' in its constitution.
By 2017, the structural budget deficit should decrease by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) every year, from 2017 the structural budget deficit of the state should not exceed the 0.35% of GDP limit, while the regional states as well as the municipalities should have balanced budgets.
The aim is to eradicate budget debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Agreement over the horizon of 2020/21.
Strong Yen
Noda threatens a new intervention in the currency markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene again in currency markets if the yen continued to rise.
"If we see excessive volatility 'in the exchange rate of the yen,' we will intervene as we did last time," M. Noda said in the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen had again rebounded close to the historical levels that forced Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo had massively sold yen against dollars in order to lower the value of Japan's foreign exchange, which is heading for a new record since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the yen has risen steadily above this, doped by purchases by investors who see the yen as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic downturn and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar fell below 77 yen on Tuesday, the euro slipped below the symbolic 105 yen bar near the levels that triggered the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was trading around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This flash in the pan of the Japanese currency harms the archipelago's exports, as it increases the cost of "Made in Japan" products and reduces the income value drawn by Japanese companies from abroad, as they exchange them into local currency.
"Japan is fighting for its reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami on March 11, which devastated the Tohoku region (northeast)," emphasizes M. Noda, who fears that this increase in yen prices could already kill the weak upswing in the bud.
With growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter, the third world economy has regained traction for the first time this year thanks to the sharp increase in exports and the consumption of households "sealed" by the disaster.
However, the prime minister estimates that yen inflation does not reflect "Japan's economic foundations."
For his part, Finance Minister Jun Azumi called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy committee on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, deputy governor of the institute, has informed that the BoJ has already taken "appropriate measures", announcing that no additional currency easing is expected on Wednesday.
At the last meeting at the end of October, the central bank increased its government bond purchases by 5,000 billion yen (47 billion euros) to repay the 55,000 billion yen (519 billion euros) of coverage it had spent on various purchases of financial securities to flood the liquidity market.
Euro area:
Interest rates soar, stock markets pull back
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis is constantly undermining European indicators.
Despite the inauguration of the new heads of government in Greece and Italy and the best growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of the weakened countries continue to rise steadily.
Stock markets, which are still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, are drifting a little further into negative territory this Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, the CAC lost 1.4% at 10 a.m., falling to 3,064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, London by 0.1%.
"Due to the new tensions over government bond yields in the troubled eurozone, global equity markets continue to issue some of their recent gains.
"Investors are nervous and only too aware of the risk of contagion," Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, told Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange, which for its part is suffering from renewed fears among market participants about capacity in Europe that the debt crisis will continue, closed with a bear market of 0.7%.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe, and trading is on a limited variational corridor as long as investors do not have evidence that the situation has stabilized," said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This resurgence of concern about the eurozone's future is damaging the single currency, which continues its bear market on Tuesday.
The euro has been at its lowest level for a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth 1.3570 dollars, falling by 0.4%.
According to the stockbrokers, it has declined after the CDU, the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel, who met in Congress on Monday, granted a request that, in particular, provides for the possibility for countries in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish rates are well below the 6% mark.
Lending rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian bonds reached 6.85% over 10 years, while that on Spanish bonds matured to 6.2%.
These tensions in interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to feed investors' fears.
The incoming Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, called on the markets to give more time to restore the situation in Italy, which is threatened by paralysis due to the debt burden.
For his part, the new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the euro zone summit on 27th October was "the main task" of his government.
Spain is in the sights of the markets as parliamentary elections take place in the country on Sunday.
The interest rate gap ("spread") between German and Spanish 10-year bonds has once again reached a new, historic high.
Awaiting Eurozone growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, supported by household consumption, slightly better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the Federal Statistical Office INSEE had revised the bear market in the figures for the second quarter, with a minus of 0.1% of gross domestic product (GDP) instead of stagnation.
In truth, it is the fourth quarter that worries economists the most.
Germany, for its part, recorded growth of 0.5% over the same period.
A first projection of the entire Eurozone is expected at 11 a.m., with the EU Commission warning of the risk of another recession.
Energy policy:
Facts should triumph over dogmas
If there is an issue that cannot be dealt with on the basis of short-term considerations or emotions, it is certainly energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity have a direct influence on the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is reasonable to take an election meeting as an opportunity to reflect on this issue and on the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruit if it explores all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution is driving a doubling of electricity demand by 2050 if an enormous proportion of the world's population does not have to do without a vital element.
At the same time, it is necessary to alleviate the scarcity of fossil resources in order to be able to continue to produce electricity consistently, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, an issue that has disappeared from the ecological debate, in order to combat climatic irregularities.
The Fukushima accident did not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany continues to be isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear power.
This is not the case in Belgium, which subordinates its decision to the need to find a substitute source, nor in Switzerland, which only intends to build last-generation nuclear power stations.
The United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name but a few, continue to pursue their projects with determination.
For its part, after Fukushima, the United States decided to add another unit to its park by reopening the Three Mile Island plant, which was shut down after the nuclear accident.
Even if the German model, which focuses on renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as a model, reality contradicts the discourse.
The election in Berlin will be reflected in an increase in the price of electricity, increased energy dependence, especially on Russia, due to the increased use of imported gas, and an increase in CO2 emissions caused by gas and coal-fired power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will become noticeable within a few months.
The case of Denmark gives cause for reflection.
On the one hand, Denmark is the European leader in terms of wind energy, from which it obtains 30% of its electricity, and on the other hand, it is one of the largest users of coal and gas, alternated with wind energy; as a result, its CO2 emissions and electricity prices are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the corresponding European average.
Thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay a 40% higher electricity bill than our French households.
Since the price of energy plays a key role in competitiveness in the globalised economy and a guarantee of stability for industry on national soil, French companies have an advantage because of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
Any significant reduction in nuclear power would therefore lead to a sharp increase in the price of energy, which would make the noble statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power an illusion.
Polls have shown that this is a price that the vast majority of French people are no more willing to pay than they show resistance to the principle of this energy source.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has made it possible to build an industry with 125,000 direct and 410,000 induced jobs.
Due to its strong export character, it brings a plethora of specialised small and medium-sized enterprises to international markets and makes them creators of countless jobs.
If France were to decide to phase out nuclear power, a large proportion of these SMEs would fall victim to it, and the €6 billion a year in capital goods and nuclear exports would shrink more and more.
What electrician would hire an EPR designed to work for sixty years when the decline of its producer is inevitable?
In order to solve the energy equation, one must admit that there is no miracle cure for the generation of electricity any more than a devil's work.
The low-CO2 solutions developed by Areva for the use of nuclear power and renewable energy testify to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest possible level of safety is an absolute imperative for nuclear power.
In France, we have a safety authority that carries out uncompromising and transparent inspections in existing plants, such as the construction site in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name for themselves due to their professionalism, are just too obsessed with the idea of security.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three serious accidents.
Only one, at Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; so it proceeded without consequences for man and the environment.
In Chernobyl, the drama was evoked by reactor construction and indefinable human error.
At Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was caused by two natural disasters of unprecedented proportions, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn the same lessons from this accident as it did after the previous two.
As a result of this approach, as well as a cooperation between the safety authorities of the French and German operators and designers of nuclear power plants, the EPR represents a blueprint that allows it to be resilient to such phenomena.
Since it is considered desirable among electrical engineers to build a nuclear power station, a halt to construction in Flamanville would be a fabulous gift to the competition from Areva and EDF, giving them free rein to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear power.
It is inevitable and legitimate to look for the best energy bouquet for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and party maneuvers dominate a debate that also determines the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
Nicolas Sarkozy's immigration policy has been criticised from many angles - overloading police, judicial and administrative bodies due to a policy based on numbers, compatibility of this policy with the status of a "country of human rights", as France had called itself.
Recently, the harassment of foreign students by the authorities had dominated the newsreels, with the Minister of the Interior casually proclaiming (see Libération of 23 May) that France "did not need talents, bricklayers or waiters from abroad".
But this policy has rarely been analysed from an economic point of view.
There is a broad consensus between the right and the left on this issue.
On the right, the tone was struck by Jacques Chirac, who declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrant workers, should not be a problem for a country", on the left by Michel Rocard, who had argued in 1990 that France "could not absorb all the poverty in the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity
The fear of the invasion of national soil by hordes of Polish plumbers was shared by both the right and the left in 2005.
Both camps perceived immigrants as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference is the degree of generosity that one is willing to admit towards immigrants.
François Hollande's programme confines himself to banalities that suggest that partnership development makes it possible to solve our "migration problems".
This idea of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may have an impact on elections; However, it is economically costly.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron remind us in a recent work summarizing the latest findings on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of the flood of immigrants on economic growth.  Wages and jobs in the countries of immigration.
Restricting immigration would weaken growth and damage the labour market situation.
Fears about the influence of migrants are based on the idea that they threaten to replace domestic workers, especially the less skilled, by putting pressure on their wages.
Experience shows, however, that immigrants are in fact much more complementary than native wage workers, as they mainly work in sectors that are underutilised in terms of jobs.
The low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not appeal to native wage workers, the more qualified immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not matched to labour supply.
Positive wage effect
Just as a surgeon would find it difficult to work in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthetists, this complementarity between natives and migrants also has a positive effect of immigrant influx on wages and the domestic labour market.
In this way, Giovanni Peri has calculated that a 1% increase in the flood of immigrants would lead to a long-term increase in real wages of between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants is conducive to the creation of ideas and economic growth (high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners; Google, Intel, PayPal, eBay, and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also make a net contribution to social systems, averaging about 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The World Labour Organization, for example, estimates that a person immigrating to Germany at the age of 30 makes an average net contribution (income minus expenses) of around 150,000 euros to the public budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy wished to bring about the missing points of intersection "with his teeth" when he took office.
However, these teeth, which were supposed to deter the immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, now it remains to think through European democracy
Democracy is a precious commodity; also a sensitive commodity.
The European continent should be able to remember for itself who, after its invention in Athens more than two thousand years ago, endured the tragedies of the First World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonel in Greece.
Some may have believed that it was enough to exercise the right to vote, in the most direct way possible, to see democracy prevail once and for all over its enemies.
It has been known since Napoleon "the Small" that it was a feature of attitude.
Universal suffrage, which is a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition for this and can just as well become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot put it at the time.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, enlightenment, economic and social community spirit, justice.
The crisis in Europe in which we find ourselves is an economic crisis, but it is just as much and first and foremost a political and democratic crisis.
The change of heart of the Greek true-false referendum would have been doubly revealing in this respect: on the one hand, that of the need for a vigorous return of politics, but on the other hand, that of the disturbing feeling of its impossibility, its inappropriateness.
This ambivalence should be considered outdated.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic struggle have shifted today, and that Republican soldiers, or at least most of them, are no longer aiming in the right direction.
We have nothing to gain in order to press for the success of the national referendum, which was organised according to necessity and in the wrong order.
A free pass for the European autocrat or a blindfolded leap into the emptiness of nationalist retreat: a great choice for the citizen!
No, we want Hackebeil, but a collective task, full of law, clarified and steady, an election and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - we do not know where to end the list - because there is only one crisis, and it is in Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that bows to the dictates of the markets and the rating agencies, which suffers from its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated at international level.
There is concern about transfers of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is gradually losing its sovereignty, and thus every single one of the nations affiliated to it.
The urgency is to put the leadership of the European project back in hand with popular sovereignty.
After all, it is up to the whole whether Europeans can reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and pave the way for a future through investment.
Exiting the crisis requires decisions at European level that cannot be taken without total democratic legitimacy, without leading us to ruin.
After a long period of opposition to this proposal by Jacques Delors and the Socialists, everyone is now urging European economic leadership to do so.
Okay.
But to imagine this without political integration and a stronger democracy - as the citizens have in mind - would be another folly and another dead end.
We must embark on a new stage in European construction.
In order to create the republic in France, it took the fact to "create" republicans.
The revolution of interests alone could not be enough here.
This instruction remains valid.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
This can only be achieved by creating a politically more democratic Europe, a truly European popular sovereignty.
We need Europeans to build Europe.
"Contactless" smart cards are becoming common property
The world trade fair for chip cards opens its doors on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris in an optimistic attitude.
According to Eurosmart, 2011 was supposed to end with an 11% increase in global sales of microprocessor chips (debit cards, SIM card phones), with more than 6 billion units sold.
The most important segment here is contactless technology, which allows payments on public transport or payment of purchases by simply holding the card up to a reader.
Compared to the 320 million sold a year earlier, 460 million contactless chip cards should be sold worldwide this year!
Their market share should continue to grow in 2012 (580 million units expected) and represent over 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
Europe is gaining ground in contactless payment after lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region for a long time.
Some 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this functionality, and 75,000 payment terminals accept it.
In France, the beginnings are rather modest: only 400,000 contactless Visa cards were distributed.
However, the hypermarkets are gaining steam.
Carrefour has therefore issued 2.5 million contactless passport MasterCards this year.
In order to move to higher speeds, it is now necessary for banks to equip their customers with these cards.
"Two major French financial institutions have committed to systematically hand out contactless bank cards to their customers in the future," announced Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks test payment by mobile phone
However, this is only a first step on the way to the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
A negligible percentage of devices have so far been equipped with the NFC (Near Field Communication) technology necessary to carry out these transactions.
"You have fallen behind".
"But they should at least experience a real upward trend next year."
"We expect to sell 80 to 120 million units worldwide in 2012," explains Marc Bertin, Chairman of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the initiative.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test run in Caen, which will run from December to next June.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees are to be equipped with a capsule that allows contactless payment.
BPCE is running a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it was preparing the launch of an offer that would allow its customers contactless payment by mobile phone.
Terrorist front of course, from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about relations between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-suspected links between the terrorist group al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram seem to be confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel himself confirmed that Algiers had now "gained certainty" about this.
"The way in which both organizations are proceeding, as well as the relations between the intelligence services, point to a clear cooperation," he said, without going into further detail.
Paris seems to be making a similar analysis.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January has brought interfaces to light.
Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory, kidnapped in a restaurant in Niamey by Aqmi supporters, were allegedly killed the following day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation carried out by the French special forces.
French and Nigerian investigators claim to have found several phone chips belonging to the terrorists in the rubble at the scene.
Terrorist axis
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several interlocutors stationed in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the investigators are particularly interested in the numbers of two interlocutors: One number leads to a Nigerian who had spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man who is considered to be close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but there is no doubt that we need to wait for clearer evidence before we can speak of operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"However, it is conceivable".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and intellectual support from outside and that this is increasingly active," says Nigerian researcher Kunle Amuwo.
In recent months, these "support services" have become increasingly evident in their course, as have Boko Harem's speeches and modes of operation, which now point to the involvement of suicide bombers and the use of increasingly complex explosives bearing the same signature as those used by Afmi.
The international community, to start with Washington, has since put pressure on Abuja to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
Indeed, the Nigerian authorities have long regarded the group as a community of Illuminati that does not need special attention.
Fast success
Founded in Maiduguri in 2002 in the vicinity of a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist Iman Mohammed Yusuf - which in Haoussa means "Western education is a disgrace" - Boko Haram is pursuing the establishment of an Islamic Emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this destitute region, the merger is experiencing rapid success.
It politicizes itself and claims strict adherence to Sharia law, while its affiliated activists are engaged in the fight against the godless central government.
The activists initially targeted churches, bars and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active with their intensified attacks against the commissariats.
However, Abuja's reaction is, as usual, indifferentiated.
The army surrounds the city, 800 dead.
Mohammed Yusuf, who has been taken prisoner, is killed in prison.
As a result, the sect becomes increasingly radical and leaves its strongholds in the north.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for an attack in Jos that claimed 80 lives, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is blamed for a suicide bombing that took place at the secured police headquarters in Abuja - the first of its kind.
In August, the local headquarters of the United Nations becomes a priority international target.
The formation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which is supposed to lead from Mauritania to Nigeria to Somalia, has worried all security experts ever since.
While the Aqmi has occupied Mali and Niger, al-Shabaab's Somalis operate in Kenya, Boko Harem appears to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria, Alain Juppé warned against Boko harem and expressed his willingness to "share all the clues".
The world according to the Republican presidential candidates
Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplifying and ignorance of China, Iraq, and helping Israel.
Can a crisis-ridden America lead a complex world with simple, not to say simple-minded, ideas?
If you listen to the Republican presidential candidates, voters could almost get that impression.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their associates have repeatedly made their thunderous statements, as well as their statements on foreign policy, the traditional Republican focus.
Slogans are used about China, Iran and aid to Israel, often unsubstantiated in any way.
Mitt Romney, who is the most popular with regard to the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", threatened to summon the Chinese to the WTO, accusing them of "currency manipulation", a leading issue in an America that is extremely irritated by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
Stupid if this is supposed to imply the initiation of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former ambassador to China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a mature vision of foreign policy, has almost choked his breath over his emotion-flattering behavior.
He had called for a tangible but constructive exchange of talks with Beijing (also Obama's current stance).
But Huntsman is not being listened to, as he is stagnating in the depths of opinion polls.
Reagan's image
Romney had also praised military strikes against Iran if sanctions to stop the nuclear program failed.
"If I am elected, I will put a stop to Iran," he had said.
"If Obama is re-elected, they get the bomb."
He has also promised Israel increased military aid and accused Obama of failing to make commitments to this partner.
For his part, entrepreneur Herman Cain, the second-highest ranked candidate, displays a shameful ignorance of the files.
Recently, he called for countering the Chinese military threat as Beijing "tries to develop a nuclear power" - seemingly ignoring the fact that China has had military nuclear weapons since 1964!
For his part, Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military strikes against Iran, says he is ready to deploy the American army in Mexico against drug cartels.
Obama's 2009 ban on the use of torture against suspected terrorists was also endorsed by Cain, Perry, and candidate Michele Bachmann.
It is a far cry from John McCain, the Republican candidate in 2008, an outside policy heavyweight.
The current presidential opponents counter that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War despite all this.
They recall that Obama himself is an amateur and had to add water to his wine when it came to counterterrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, the hasty withdrawal of his "boys" from Iraq, his indecisiveness in Libya, which also earned him a reputation for weakness.
However, this hostility is not quite so informal.
The population rather appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which bin Laden has eliminated.
Since Iraq, it has been wary of military interventions that lead to paralysis.
And Obama surprises more appropriately by arguing that America must be economically rebuilt to revive its leadership.
Nord Stream, new gateway to Russian gas in Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which runs along the seabed of the Baltic Sea and connects Western Europe directly with Russia, has been put into operation.
It is expected to supply gas to the equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian gas giant Gazprom wanted to celebrate this event with glamour and glory.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 invited guests, including four heads of state and government, attended the inauguration of the new Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Russia and Germany below sea level, on the Baltic Sea coast under orchestral sound and a gourmet buffet.
German Chancellor Angelika Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his counterpart Mark Rutte from the Netherlands symbolically turned the wheel of the valve that transports Russian gas to the Western European grid.
The new gas pipeline is expected to deliver 27.5 billion cubic meters of additional Russian gas per year to Western Europe through an initial pipeline of 1,224 km in length connecting the St. Petersburg region with Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline, capable of a total supply of 55 billion cubic metres of gas - the equivalent of total French consumption - is due to be completed by the end of 2012.
And the eventuality of the construction of a third line on the same route is already hinted at.
For Gazprom, the timely and punctual completion of this enormous structure looks like a victory.
The project was highly controversial in Poland and the Baltic States.
The Nord Stream pipeline will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding any overland route through third countries (Poland or Ukraine).
For this reason, these two countries are losing some of their power: it is now becoming more difficult for them to put pressure on Russia by threatening to close access to Western European markets.
Warsaw, most engaged in the debate, did not shy away from comparing the Nord Stream pipeline to a "new german-Soviet pact" linked to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin for the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that the issue is politically extremely sensitive.
Western Europe has gained even greater security of supply by endorsing this Russian project.
This, however, comes at the cost of debilitating European energy, as the project has opened a breach between Western and Eastern Europeans.
In less than five years, Russia has managed to impose its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and rich Western countries, which consume heavily gas and are running out of gas reserves.
"This gas pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new artery that connects us organically," François Fillon confirmed at the inauguration of the gas pipeline, pointing out the extent to which the major gas contracts are also important from the political and economic point of view.
All this explains the broad smiles of the numerous Gazprom managers in Lubmin regarding the gas supply line.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an outstanding technique.
The underwater pipe is made of steel with concrete sheathing to protect it from ship anchors.
It rests on the seabed, at a depth of about 200 m.
During its construction, minefields dating from the Second World War had to be avoided.
"About hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution," said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
In addition, increased measures had to be taken to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe is a long queue of metal, as heavy as 242 Eiffel Towers, which is not interrupted by anything along its entire length: neither by valves nor maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned off the coast of Sweden, but the project managers refrained from doing so, as the Swedes were not keen to see a Russian state company permanently settling at the height of their coasts.
"In the event of an accident, we close the gas outlet in less than a minute," Jens Müller explained.
In the event of a leak, the gas in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
However, this case is considered by the designers to be unlikely, as the weld seams were estimated to have a resistance of one leak per 100,000 years.
State monitoring of the gas pipeline is ensured both by an underwater robot controlled from a seagoing vessel for external observation purposes and by a device circulating inside the gas pipeline.
It has the shape of a cigar, is one meter in diameter, is inserted into the interior of the pipeline and moved by the gas pressure.
After three full days of movement through the pipe at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides the most accurate information about possible deformations of the metal upon arrival.
The gas pipeline was designed to operate for fifty years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is simply ensured by pressure.
This is 200 bar at the point of entry, 100 bar at the exit point.
Five companies have joined forces to realize this project.
However, the management remains in the hands of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companies E. ON and BASF are affiliated here (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the gas pipeline.
It is based in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire capacity of its gas transmission to this company on a renewable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, no matter how large the real amount of gas transported," Jens Müller said.
30% of the financing of the gas pipeline construction was secured by shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total labour costs should amount to 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment amounted to 240 million.
However, the minority shareholders are certain to recover their expenses, as Gazprom alone bears the liability risk.
The gas pipeline emerges from the Baltic Sea on a sandy, pine-wooded coastline near Lubmin.
The 4.5 metre high valves form the gas outlet gate.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other key figures of the incoming gas before it is forwarded to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, this terminal has been supplied with one million cubic meters of Russian gas per elapsing hour.
At full capacity, this would be 3 million cubic meters per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notebook.
Founded by an Italian company about fifteen years ago, Moleskine now wants to give writing a new style.
It has a flair of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
Moleskine's notebook is easily recognizable, with its black rectangular cover, elastic band, eggshell pages, aged over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was created in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, which is based in Milan, decided to launch a distinguished design notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, the company's expert advisor at the time, was tasked with launching the new product.
The notebook was inspired by an ancient production technique called Mole Skin, which refers to a cotton ack used for upholstered benches, for example.
This type of notebook was in high demand among writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has revived an old and almost forgotten object that was considered an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," explains Maria Sebregondi, now brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success kicks in.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and established themselves with sales of 12.7 million units.
This is a far cry from the usual production of the first years, in which only 3,000 notebooks were conceived.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notebook inspires business people as well as students and professionals.
Moleskine has the image of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-minded customers.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now employs over 100 people and has had two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company sells its notebooks in bookshops, on Internet portals such as Fnac, in small boutiques in city centres and knows how to assert its identity.
"We have followed the zeitgeist and its new writing needs, which persist despite the rise of emails," explained Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural trait is accompanied by the development of the Moleskine company: recently the brand has launched an exhibition called "Detour", in which architects and artists exhibit their own notebooks.
In August, the company also launched a leopard-print cover on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Benefiting from its success and this cultural zeitgeist, Moleskine was able to diversify its products: bags, calendars, fountain pens, computer cases... The brand has the entire range of articles.
A success that brings envy on the scene: In autumn 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, today's Syntegra Capital, and thus opened a new chapter in the history of Moleskine.
Why does the unemployment rate of disabled workers remain at such a high level?
About 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
Today marks the beginning of the "15th Week of Work for the Disabled".
Despite a targeted public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate for disabled people is always twice as high as the average average: 19% against 9% unemployment of the total population.
Daunting?
"No," stresses Éric Blanchet, Director General of the Adapt association, which organises the 'Week of Work for the Disabled'.
"The progress made in fifteen years has been considerable."
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice as high, but three times as high."
"Nevertheless, there is still a lot to do."
However, it must be said that many obstacles persist for disabled unemployed people before they can get a job.
Older people are more likely to be affected: 37% are older than 50 years (17% on average).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% of them do not have a high school diploma and there are only 10,000 disabled people among the 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, long-term unemployment is also very widespread: 53% for the disabled compared with an overall average of 38%.
In short, there are so many criteria that make it difficult to return to work and that "go to the heart of the problem," according to Christian Grapin, director general of Tremplin, an association founded in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
So much for the factual brakes.
What remains is the unspoken, the attitudes that develop certainly, but slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the journal La Cité stated that the managers interviewed had "a low level of knowledge of disabled people" that was "over-represented by people in wheelchairs, mentally or intellectually poor".
As a result, private companies with more than 20 employees still have a long way to go to meet the employment target of 6% disabled workers set out in a 1987 law.
These latter figures, from 2008, refer to a ratio of 2.6%.
"We are now around 3%," says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, the organisation tasked with collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: The number of "fee-paying" permanent establishments, as well as the sum of the amounts paid, decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which provides for increases in contributions, created strong pressure on companies," explained Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also expresses a real insight, especially among the large groups of companies."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of establishments with between 20 and 49 employees employ disabled workers, while companies with 100 to 199 employees employ 82%.
Hazard: "What luck"
Even before they stood up to the Blue Tuesday evenings (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens had not concealed the pleasure that the friendly brought them.
It would be too far-reaching to claim that there was collusion between them, but the picture speaks symbolic volumes.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard could well have made peace.
Five months after his attacking player's spirited gesture against Turkey, the Belgium coach had received nothing but praise for himself.
"I am very happy with Eden, his progress and the fact that he is Belgian."
"I want to look ahead," assures the native Liller for his part.
As for the contrast between his representation in club and national team: "It's a unity, that justifies everything."
"I'm in Lille all year round, which is not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, brought about Friday night against Romania for the match against France, to finally "shine".
However, without omitting the note of "pleasure".
He has been cheering for the French national team since the age of 7, leading his victorious campaigns between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This inevitably contributes to reinforcing the 'unique' character of this encounter.
So much in advance: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he recalls.
"We just crossed paths."
"To be able to play against them means great luck!"
Leekens, for his part, hinted at "pride" with good-naturedness.
"The pride of holding a gala match".
"Proud" also to confirm - in its capacity as "neighbours" - that France "has once again become a team at a very high level", little more than a year after the trauma of Knysna.
"Laurent Blanc did a damn good job," he said enthusiastically.
Although Belgium will be missing from the next European Championship, the technician sees himself sharing the plane with the Blues (the French national team) ... to Brazil in 2014.
"We little Belgians come out big," he stressed.
"We're in the process of planning one thing, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll notice that in the upcoming games." Including the game against France.
Portugal very confident
Paulo Bento's Portuguese team is looking forward with great optimism to the second leg against Bosnia (22:00) this Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first leg, both teams had lacked objectivity.
"At the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy team and above all a happy country."
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is not the slightest hint of doubt that "La Selecçao", his national team, for which he has been responsible since September 2010, will qualify for the 2012 European Championship.
For Portugal, in fact, this means only 90 minutes of bliss.
But there is a match to play and an opponent to serve, and that is Bosnia.
Considering the first leg (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the die has not yet been cast.
Portugal clearly dominated the game for more than an hour, but the team was unable to put the all-important stamp on the matter that would have taken the pressure off them.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score an away goal."
At home, however, in their brightly lit Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced to make their way in front of a crowd that is likely to be just as keen on the game, even if the game was of course announced as "very close", said the optimistic but clear-sighted Bento.
"We expect a very close match, but we are fully convinced that we can gain the upper hand," said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of being at the 2012 European Championship," said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
Friday's draw in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
A draw can be enough for the Bosnians, who also need a goal.
"It's a good result, but it carries a certain risk because we didn't score an away goal," Bento said.
"We will be playing against a team that has high technical qualities and players with many individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese intend to exert maximum pressure on the Bosnians from the outset so as not to "give them time to think".
A good idea, provided that it is put into practice this time.
