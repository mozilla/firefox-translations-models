Barack Obama is the fourth US president to win the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma as well as the medal and a cheque for 1.4 million. Dollar for its extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The head of the White House will arrive tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the northern transgression and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with the five committee members who elected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony, at which Obama will hold the prestigious prize.
He is the fourth US president to receive this, but only as the third to accept the prize directly in office.
The White House has already seen that Obama will talk about the war of Afghanistan when the prize is taking over the award.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the price as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
A few days ago, he intensified the war effort by sending off further troops to Afghanistan, which none forgets of his critics.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Gol medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish krone (approx. 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charitable purposes, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The programme of events then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, where, in addition to Norway's King and Queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious about price from the beginning.
He cited, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve the price.
He also repeated several times that it is the price not only for him, but for all those who want the same values as he want.
Immediately after the announcement he listed that for him it was "imitation to action".
Conservationists are accused of blackmail
The central retirement police accused the chairman of the civic association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" for blackmail.
In several cases, he adopted lengthy appeals against some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the lead retired police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the leading community of corporate directors Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in custody and threatens a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages the sorting garbage containers can be found again at every turn.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the suitable garbage cans.
I do not want to say that waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors are insufficiently concerned with this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the republic.
Brno is located in the waste division in the Urwald League, not only because we as citizens are allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but above all due to the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Have they tried to dispose of PET bottles in a collecting basket, for example, at some point in the centre?
This is art, before it all takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Moravian Square opposite the sun goose.
Mr Onderka should not be angry with his colleagues, but that doesn't seem to me much too little.
Apart from the fact that waste separation is not a honey lick in other parts.
Entire rows of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste.
Out of laziness.
It is too far to the garbage cans for them.
I am not surprised.
I have offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles myself after the celebration.
But on Konicova street I didn't see any paint waste bins in sight.
Luckily I came to the right place when I was travelling by tram.
The garbage almost ran over.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn't it?
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to leave the Brno socialists cold.
You'd rather buy a hockey league in the city, which makes us shame throughout the Republic instead of buying a few garbage cans more and offer sorting more resources for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the EKO-KOM company, Brno really stands the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick pay
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government's view, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness money and construction saving business.
But also not for the national debt interest or for the international court disputes.
This causes those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the severe spending, old-age pensions or for sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mining," says Janota.
From the loans, ever-higher interest rates are paid, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where does the state treasury is empty.
If social benefits or costs for the state enterprise are not cut, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party has now spent more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later also for their children.
To the pensions or the sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the cost of the state becoming more indebted - in the next year not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister Janota, debt will thus increase faster and faster, together with it, costs and interest rates.
The state will need the money to compensate, then it will no longer be enough to increase VAT only slightly or to cut maternity money, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Due to the change of money in favour of some electoral groups, there will also be no five billions in the expansion of motorways and railways next year.
These are predominantly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be reprojected and possibly cheapen.
Receive what is not free.
This means the delay or cessation of thirty large buildings, and the European money creation is also at risk, warns Karel Hanzelka, the spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The CSSD has proposed that it triggers the outflow of money salomonic - it attacks the CEZ share dividend, where the state owns the majority, and from which the money is then distributed to the Transport Fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, CEZ flowed into the budget for 18 billion.
Every year, the environmental damage liquidation is paid out of the dividends, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, the actual budget deficit on the Nieveau of 5.7% GDP is also increasing according to the EU rules.
But that does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and crime or for expenses for the court disputes, even for building saving.
Whether the state can handle this money is not safe.
That is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court dispute, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister then has to save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing for the already started two-billion dollar project "State Treasury", which is to enable them to monitor on-line, for what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
If the finance minister does not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect a phone in the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented are promising.
It is enough to press only one button, and from Windows Mobile will alternate Android within seconds.
It is precisely this possibility that the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses primarily on the development of the virtual software for computers.
We enable you to execute two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, they can disconnect them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware suggested in an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
The market will be in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full scale.
Now VMware is working together with European and American operators on smartphone smartphone continuation and the customers are to come to the customer within 2012.
The hotel owners torture hotel owners for snow lacking in the mountains
Scneeless slopes are not only worried to the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering their ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore you can still do room in the Giant Mountains for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, note the prices, but now they are afraid to order bindingly.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, cited.
If you want to stay in the New Year's Eve in the Spindelmühle exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers saving and where the quality of the stay only comes in second place can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners now offer weekly stays for New Year's Day.
I think that they will make an effort to sell it for a while, but then they too must give in and go into shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly fade, Jandura estimated.
The Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi always offers free beds on all winter dates.
Now we are most interested in Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still free.
That is why we have already prepared a few cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, headed the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can still offer New Year's Day in Giant Mountains, but there are fewer places to do here.
Good sales will also be sold for the first fortnights in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than in the previous year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest during the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janske Lazne for the New Year's Eve stay.
By contrast, half of the beds are still available at Christmas in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised by January this year, for which we are currently already occupied by about 60 percent.
A little weaker is now February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains is certainly increasing, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, leading.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow.
On Thursday it should cool off and if there is rainfall, it should be snow on the mountains.
But afterwards another warming is to come, Jiri Jakubsky informed the location of the Czech Weather Office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is a mother of cleverness
It is almost funny with what disciple ambition Barack Obama, the president, with his reputation of the wisest, repeats the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself considered to be the most stupid.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he was writing about the copy paper from the Busch Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only does he himself use the saying "as in Iraq" several times in the text, he has even used the name of the Bush statement of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward", without hesitated.
Three years ago, he himself criticised the Bush idea - to send out fresh troop contingents in Iraq plagued by the civil war - as "unsponsibly and in its conclusions of the karastrophic decision."
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, which results from the recommendations of the military was the only possible and very successful in this respect that the news is no longer talking about Iraq at all.
Bush's reputation has not been improved by this, because objectively he left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will repeat itself.
The military has again asked him to increase the troop contingent, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan's operation, General Stanley McCristal, who even hardly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House, despite the subordination habits.
He caused 40,000 soldiers to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea, so he cheated on the general for 10,000 troops.
He has pressed the commitment from Europe to another 5,000, even though he himself originally had at least 10,000.
Highly problematic across the entire Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves behind more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the fratricidal war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honour the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - no one can rely on anyone and no agreements are held.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces who are accustomed to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally founded, remain only bogus buildings, behind which the patriarchal root relations will continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the complexity of the conditions that further complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran.
The construction of a "active state", which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation, is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of the Obama Strategy alienated by its voluntarism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of the explosion.
What the little soldiers who have broken out into the war shouting of the "early return" create a miracle here can only be a truly romantic soul, which is not impressed by facts, can only be a truly romantic soul.
From the political point of view, the date for deduction for troop deprivation is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will include this as the indirect confession of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that Europeans' willingness to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
Nor can Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is connected with the war in the Hindu Kush mountaineering.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to worsen and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, there is a very serious question for the United States whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America is moving to Obama to take off from the victorious from Afghanistan.
However, every solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years to become a presidential election, and so there is still enough time to resort to another strategy, it would prove to be a total failure.
Bank managers Goldman Sachs no longer receive award bonuses in cash
The senior executives at the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This is announced by the company, which responds to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receives shares instead of the money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is thus at the forefront of efforts to connect Wall Street's premeboni with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it has to go, led the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs set itself the target of criticism after she set aside almost 17 billion dollars for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year, according to the Reuters agency, will probably exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure indicated today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-time tax on the bankers' bonuses, which exceed 25,000 pounds, with a tax of 50 percent.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all fields, excluding in physics.
Five record women today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf to this year's Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta Müller, was also among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, received the Nobel Prize in Medicine, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for research in the chromoson sector.
The Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, received the award for chemistry for clarifying the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate was awarded to the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her fellow countryman Oliver Williamson had received for analyses of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao spent this prize on behalf of research in the optical fibers sector and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis for all digital chamberas, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these award winners has received the diploma, the Nobelmedaile and a certificate of earning the cash prize.
This amounts to ten million Swedish kronor in each category.
If there are several award winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American President, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize this afternoon in Oslo.
In his speech, he recognized the conquest of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his way, and is also at the head of the country, which is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In safeguarding his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering his resignation. Klaus has invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who thinks about his stay in the government because he does not agree with the execution of the state budget for next year in the form released by the Assembly of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and perhaps also the staying of Janota in the cabinet will be the themes of the Friday meeting.
The budget is also criticised by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which is also deepening the crisis of public finances.
The Presidents' Spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota will talk about his further stay in his role on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer.
According to the budget law, which Klaus is now being signed, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In parliament, however, on Wednesday, the Left Party proposals for the change of funds were voted on and the money for the state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers were increased.
The government has said that the S&D proposals have increased the budget deficit covertly.
Between the Left Party on one side and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, on which the question mark about the further work of the Fischer-Beamtenkabinet, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as adopted by parliament, practically liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the fishermen's government in the autumn, and that according to their understanding, the public debt should end.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget, but does not have today, explained today during the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that "the unsustainable deficit" of public finances is neglected for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no longer a good solution.
An improvement could only bring a strong government that could build on a broader consensus among political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, argued that the budget is horrible and the government should weigh its continued existence.
ODS chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the cabinet of civil servants, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, apparently no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described similar words in the editorial board as "strong sayings".
The CSSD boss, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was horrifying, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Indevaded" shows a lot about the country, of its struggle and victories, despite some reviews, that the leading role was cast by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, racial conditions and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and her first black president, Nelson Mandela, presents the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman, in his life story.
Freeman said that he was asked by ninety-one-year-old Mandela to portray him in the Eastwood movie.
Matt Damon plays another meaningful role.
I told him, "If I play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the prize for his role in the Eastwood drama from the "Million Dollar Baby" boxing area, already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, which has finally become a slave owner, a fictional U.S. president, and also God in "Evan All-Might", but rarely someone who lives and is as important for many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was imprisoned for 27 years in prison for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time this is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, which was published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true story in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to reach the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people remain still race-dye and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can reach out to his people through the sport, so he decides to agree the rugby players who belong to the outsiders worldwide.
The South African team eventually moved to the World Cup of 1995.
Freeman worked on it for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal but to play this role to bring it closer to reality as closely as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak as he did.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were to be in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela, to have dinner with him and be behind the scenes in front of his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake Mandela's hand.
I have found when I shake you up, I take your energy, it is transmitted, and I felt that I know what you feel, he said.
It is important for me to become another person.
Matt Damon is in the film Francois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the hard rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he was opening and the first thing I said to Francois Pienaar in my life was: 'I look much bigger in the film.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors in comparison with their actual role models, he has received "Invictus: Undschlag" "Invictus" under the direction of director Eastwood and they also speak of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety sheet, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "That was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Secret of light over Norway disbanded: The Russians tested a rocket
A special light effect of unknown origins was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defence only yesterday admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch, however, was again not successful and the rocket, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian general and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin, called the type "Bulava".
His repeated presence on site at the rocket test also had no positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been started at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers you already write about "Bulava" as over a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but shines
This one already 13. Attempt, went normal at the beginning.
Only at the end of the flight have occurred technical damage to the rocket.
The engine probably exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time "Bulava" departed from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donskij, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the shipment from the submarine.
It is therefore likely that the mysterious light over northern tract caused by an indefinite flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, since the first moment, the Norwegians have not doubted that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the generals have neglected against it and asserted that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident was only affected by the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were damaged.
Even if there was no test start without errors, the leadership of the Ministry of Defence considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fulfills the general's content with optimism, and so it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will fly without problems and even up to ten hypersonic blastheads with a total weight of max. 1,15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov presents himself again at the age of 51 in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and will probably be competing against Petersburg in Friday duel.
Fetisov, who has completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently President of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify some remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
In the meantime, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will only be affected by a game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other other players, led up teammates Nemcinov.
When Fetisov returns to the ice, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a fifty-one season for Hartford for a fifty-one and benefited 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles and he also triumphed in the Canada Cup and in the Junior World Championship.
In second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he doubled the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime are cancelled
The management of the Hyundai Nosovice-Automobilfabrik agreed with the union on the cancellation of all overtime.
The union announced its willingness on Monday because of frequent overtime.
This was confirmed by the spokesman for Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists about a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, therefore it was held on Saturday, the 19th December, volunteer overtime proposed at the reason that two shifts would be worked on, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The employees will also receive them afterwards for the Saturday shift from 28 January. November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivations of the employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they can pay for the overtime surcharge or they can require a replacement holiday on 28. Vanek performed in December and thus extend the Christmas holidays.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid to the fare and lunch.
In view of the fact that the overtime hours were the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the lifting of all overtime for the month of December, VanÃ1⁄2k led.
Until last week, the employees of the automobile factory were forced to work 2 overtime hours practically every day after the eight-hour shift.
From the signing of the agreement, the trade unions will refuse to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the Automobilfabrik and the trade unionists are to be made on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they agree on the fulfilment of the demands and sign a joint document, they were willing to repeal the willingness to strike.
The location in the automobile factory acute last week, on Wednesday, as approx. 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment terms and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that employees must make overtime to comply with the automotive supply needs.
In their Monday stability notice, the trade unionists also demanded that the employees who had interrupted production on Wednesday would not be imposed with sanctions.
In the area of overtime, the unions are demanding that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are calling for the remuneration of 5000 crowns to be paid out this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
Series production was started in the company in November last year.
Until this September, approx. 80,000 vehicles manufactured, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works with shled HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new connections to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already resistant to medication.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the compound on common virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the composition of the drugs can prolong their lives and prevent the increase of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake will be accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus reproduction has also included development sg. Cause resistant viruses to which no more medicines are effective.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technical University) Prague and the University in Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances referred to as metal carbovers have an effect on the protein that is responsible for the increase of the HIV virus.
The metal carbovers are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block virus multiplication in a different way than any drugs used today, therefore they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new "improved" compounds that were prepared based on the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding on the virus protein.
The metal carbohydrates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-faceted cages, which consist of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Sicky and resistant virus
HIV prose is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus splitting caused by the HIV trial, no mature infectious virus particles would be formed.
If we eliminate the HIV protease, we also switch off the proliferation of the patient's body, the scientists in the press report, published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the Science Newspaper Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of connections in which two pairs of the cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which are then systematically further altered.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease was tested in a test tube, also against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained by HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metal carboctor on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metal carboveraans interesting compounds for further research aimed at developing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemis and the Institute of Molecular Genetics at the Academy of Sciences.
Dispute because of budget. ODS went to fisherman, who fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "greyful" and in his opinion the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its further existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS' statement as "strong sayings."
It is supposedly time for analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the cabinet of civil servants, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
After Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether to base himself in parliament on the minority when it comes to the fight against the increasing deficit, or whether he is concerned with his stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problems of public deficits is diametrically different, which is what Necas has pointed out.
Parliament adopted the budget for 2010 on Wednesday, however with Link Party changes for more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for state officials' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the social democracy that it has covertly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic was to operate with a gap of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the room before the vote, it complied with the government's wishes, because the amended budget is only a less poor variant of the budget provisions. Frase not clear
Disappointment and senselessness
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, spoke about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has led the government to assess the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened his resignation in the event that the amendments would be accepted, the situation would be different.
According to Czech television, Janota has registered with the Premier for Monday after the government business.
He indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at the need for the budget.
According to Necas, the nominators of the social democracy (CSSD), which had made the changes in the budget, have nothing to do in the government, according to Necas.
The prime minister should also state clearly that it will step down if parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, for example those concerning sickness benefits and pensions, or the Russian law amendment.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS did not err
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the USA.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, in some ministries, people are sitting in acting who commit to TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to refrain from fighting against the deficit amount of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that it is based on the left majority, which is currently in Parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizens' democrats.
I did not think about this, and if that is up to date, then I will deal with it, said the Minister of Defence Martin Bartak, who was nominated by the Citizen Democrats, the journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the changed budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister would explicitly ask the citizens' Democrats' MPs to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back during the political trial of the budget by the absence of the party chairman in parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I did not realize that my voice would be missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the next months it would be all about the Bolweewer of the parliament and destroying everything positive, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
The Czech Railways terminated or restricted from 13. December some less loaded quick and local trains, while other connections are being reinforced.
The entire volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the day of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most rates incl. The basic and customer travel rates will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital are preserved, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses Pendolino trains for this line.
The express train will no longer go to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer express trains will also travel on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, and the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad are generally reduced.
The railway plans to reduce the largest reduction in the Hradec Kralove district (Königsgraz), in total eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route will also be lifted and to a few days a week, the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route is reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct transport route from Milovice to Prague, and the residents of Milovice currently have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth road of the Esko suburban system, whose opening is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
Long-distance routes to the capital will end in the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run every two hours.
With the Pendolino passengers have been able to take place since 13. Do not go to Bratislava in December.
This year's bill for Regional Railway: 200 million increase
The express trains are appointed and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, the railway will receive four billion crowns, precisely as this year, to pay the so-called liquidity loss in the next year. The local trains supply the districts, they pay eight billions of crowns in the next year, with the state shooting three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains and express trains, the railway has signed a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps therefore it did not use the price increase for the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price CD Net will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the driven stick, until now it was uniform for travel between any district towns and cost 160 crowns.
Filipino Millitante arrest more than 50 people, and the children were released.
Today, Millitante abducted 75 people in the south of the Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This is what the agency AFP has mentioned, which originally only provided more than 65 abductees.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping was in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 Millitante allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now trying to hand over the rest of the hostage.
According to the AFP agency, the military officials belong to the New Army (NPA), this is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police persecuted the kidnappers because of the violence, which demanded revenge between the two local family claims.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, the right of professionals was imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the 23rd massacre In November, which was coming to terms with the election to governor, there were 30 journalists.
The governor of this South-Philan-Furf province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested for suspected of participating in the massacre.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
However, the peace negotiations with the phillippinian government once again began on Tuesday.
The history of South Africa concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film will be released in the American cinemas "Invictus: the Untroverted", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
Morgan Freeman has received the role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid, who was supposedly selected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
Matt Damon has received the supporting role of legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar.
With the film theatrical release, critics and the public are also voiced.
Nelson Mandela
With all his name he is called Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18. July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 the Nobel Peace Prize together with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are placed in the film because it is coming to cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa culminate on the one hand, but at the same time the media are shocking world public shocking world public with frightening news about rising racial hatred and discrimination against the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the cast of the leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well.
Several times I met Nelson Mandela personally so that I could - as you say - we can receive his energy, he performed in an interview after the film's festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it is good if we can use this film to get rid of the personality of Mandela and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he supplemented.
In the dress of the national rugby team
The film is based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, freely translated 'In the role of the enemy': Nelson Mandela and the game that unites the people portray the South African advocate of human rights within its first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman is trying to bring together two race-district groups and populations that have been demarcated since years and each year and after each year, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also appears in his role in the South African National Rugby Dress on the World Cup field, which South Africa won at the time.
Fourteen years ago, Mandela harvested large ovations, predominantly from the white audience, fourteen years ago, and thus won the recognition of the white population, winning the recognition of the white population.
The rugby championship may be able to unite people together into one people, led rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve only become apparent.
However, the white South Africans are sceptical, as has revealed in recent interview for the LN rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship begins on 11. June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers for several 10 million crowns burn
The fire broke out in the morning on the transformer of the Ceps company in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Originally, the fire brigade wanted to let the transformers burn out, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing materials.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer short closing.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the security operation of the pipeline system, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be estimated after the fire.
The destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one according to Mandatova.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened to Ceps, errors of this species are rare, she supplemented.
The electricity supply was not interrupted by the sponsorship of households, authorities and companies in accordance with the spokesperson of the CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, and the transformer station fire.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the line system, the electrical cables of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, with which the electrical energy is transferred to the distribution system and line with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura makes a criminal complaint for defamation against three conductors of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is now making a lawsuit for slander against three Social Democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the Pardubice district and the head of the Olomouc district, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train transport in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three ladders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, and we made the offer only about the size as they agreed.
They claim that we are expensive as the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were completed last week.
So we have nothing left but to defend us.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency company, Jancura told the radio journal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
We are therefore preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal complaint to be the further continuation of the media show of Jancura, which serves as a free promotion for his company and for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the reputation of my district, and I also call for further ladders.
I assume that it will also become clear on this matter that it is Jancura who uses the public manipulation and uses lying and false and false arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in the advertising that will point to the adverse step of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he wants to interrupt the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He specified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed on the Czech Railways at the instigation of regional rail transport and had not put any tenders on tenders for the order in a high for 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, he was already threatened with a member of the CSSD, according to Jancura.
The only threat was if we do not renounce that we could then lose bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, Jancura said to the radio journal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free of charge and voluntary
The fit against pneumococcal changes the familiar from January.
It is the first for the families to be free and voluntary.
But votes are already incurring are coming that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Culminate the preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal.
The Medicinal Institute is already set the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance has to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococcal colic, which is held on 2. August last year and later were born.
The condition that they have not yet received a dose of vaccination.
Anyone who has already started vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for further repeat vaccination yourself.
The first dose of vaccination must be between the 3rd and 5th. Month of life of the child.
Last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for one dose.
Four doses are required for vaccination of youngest children.
Overall, the experts estimate that the health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year on the vaccination doses.
However, you save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has approx. 500,000 per year.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal causes middle ear inflammation, but also severe infections, including menoquial inflammation and blood poisoning.
After examination in hospitals, up to 28 children aged 10 die per year from pneumococcal infections.
Outside the Czech Republic, the mandatory vaccination of the children against pneumococci was presented in approx. 40 countries introduced.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, these should be paid by the insurance and voluntary.
The head of the Nahlas Civic Association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the obligatory vaccination would be better.
His association is already promoting pneumococcal vaccination in the long term.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association were involved, were not very satisfied with the fact that we had voluntary vaccination.
This is not quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are happy that we have succeeded in at least achieving that.
I believe that this is the path we have to walk now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination against pneumococcal.
At that moment, we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairwoman of the specialist association of practical paediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccination "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
The experts expect that more than 80 percent of parents will be vaccinated by their infants against pneumococcus next year.
Vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination to be paid by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so they save on further treatment, says Cabrnochova.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this involves a concern of the practical paediatricians concerning the purchase of the vaccines.
After the initial plan, the vaccines were to be bought through the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them on the same route as other vaccines issued by the state to them.
However, some Members feared that the insurance companies could "carry out the money from health insurance".
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them.
According to estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This won't be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artists' son involved in "museum theft"
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth 20 million dollars from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was enclosed in his vehicle with a trailer when loading 90 paintings.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used an excavator to penetrate the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist stayed in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said that Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed, he was instructed by his father "that he should penetrate the museum by all means to bring all the paintings to a camp."
The agency announced that Frank Frazetta contested seniors who had given any permission.
Labour defending budget and tax increases
Ministers defended the tax increases and expenditure stops announced in the pre-state report against the criticism of the opposition, the economy and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had an opportunity to "defold" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by sweeping the decisions down to the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire to target workers with low and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1% capping limit for public wages for 2011.
Social security dults
The unions have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession that they did not caused and warned of impending "problems".
The increase in the social security system – at approximately GBP 3 billion per year – has angered the private sector, which says that this is a tax on jobs, even though the focus should be on the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than 20,000 dollars per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
COMPENCE OF THE BEFAB REVIEW
Increased social insurance by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy is shrinkaged by more than the expected 4.75 %
New 50% tax on Bankier Bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses discarded
Tax Discounts for Electric Vehicles and Wind Turbines
2.5% increase in state pensions
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of 30,000 pounds per year will be poorer at 90 dollars per year and someone will be poorer at around €190,000, while a person with a 10,000 dollar annual income will be richer by 110 dollars.
Ministers said their target of deficit halving by 2013 means "dreamy decisions," but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be borne by the 5% of the top-expenses.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the tax increases and expenditure bans outlined compared to the necessary measures would be "a drop in the ocean".
"These are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour predictions of future economic growth – affecting the level of new debt and the speed of deficit suspension – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Exchequer Force was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while debt would be higher than previously estimated at 3 billion dollars.
"Versip opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn against Labour's "debt crisis", said that the planned debt of GBP 789 billion over the next six years is untenable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how to repay this and "cynically" shirk difficult decisions by the election - which must take place in June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't matter what they will do," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their chance to do this, and they let them pass by."
"The significant announcements are made only after the election whoever wins them."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police are saved from future cuts, unlike in the Conservative proposals, which see the deficit capping faster and more likely to come.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money won by the tax increases and spending bans is used to cover spending next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "boiled up."
BBC political editor Nick Robinson said that some at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment for some disability pensions next April – would expose the Chancellor of the Exalpense to the charge of fishing votes, as the money could simply be returned next year.
Labour insists on providing extra aid when people need it most and the situation being re-examined in September 2010.
"Hohler budget"
Although ministers have not disclosed any budget details beyond 2011, economists say that the pressure on public spending will only be released in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said that the figures of the Chancellor of the Chancellor would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It only shifts the pain to later," said Robert Chote leader.
"The significant announcements are only made after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, an economic advisor at the auditing firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-state report. The markets recognize this."
FBI investigates "Conceptions of US Citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported US citizens on suspicion of extremist ties in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during a attack on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Pandshab Province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is being investigated whether these are the same men who were reported missing month in the US state of Virginia.
The US State Department said that they are also looking for information about men.
Three of them are said to be Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"Of course, if they are American citizens, we are very interested in the charges that are accused of them and under what circumstances they are being held," said spokesman Ian Kelly.
The FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if the missing students are," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington announced that the men were arrested in a house that belongs to the uncle of one of the students.
He said that the local police had previously been interested in the house and that no charges have been filed against the men who were arrested.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton refused to comment on the arrests, but she said that the US must "cooperate more easily with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism, which continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns "Missives" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organisation Amnesty International, human rights are still as bad in Iran as they have done in the past 20 years.
The report detailed "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report stated that he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected its human rights record earlier criticism.
Officials said that such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of prison sentences and prosecutors said that at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC tenre correspondent Jon Leyne, now in London, said that at the beginning of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, recognized some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, the authorities have not had any tolerance for criticism, said our correspondent.
"False confession"
Amnesty International quoted the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said that he was charged with "work with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They slapped me face frequently," he was quoted.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head. They threatened me with death and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
Defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the allegations of rape, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also called the case of a former prisoner who said that he had been held in a container in a container in a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty recognized that the Iranian parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the riots after the election and government's reactions to them, but according to Amnesty, the mandates and power of these organs would be unclear and the results won by the parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said that in the last three weeks, at least 90 people were arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slopes have been established in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competition slope.
The ski slope of this parking session attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who were fighting for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon-Hill-Park there was a short ski jumping hill at the beginning of a 100 meter long hill.
The student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the summit of the hangover, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city that glisten below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents."
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or tricks executed on the hillside.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow will be left to melt.
Still it and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters voted in favour of a ban on minarets and the concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into a most statedly secularized societies in Europe – and are being integrated.
Some readers will read this new book for admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French do not love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves (2006), an elegant and collecting a controversial study of a controversial issue that the country shared and employed for a decade and whose effects are still perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes, which now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it "Islamic Open Spaces".
He is a good listener, he shows debates between teachers and students about the issues they most disturb.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or a town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-oriented banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims that make up daily life, quite as opposed to the political dramas that concern the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none with a well-known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, an Arab-Muslim scholar and academic born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They do not have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who questioned Bowen are mostly divided with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of the purist Sunni Islam connected with Saudi Arabia – who nowadays show a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen is of the opinion that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires giving and taking on both sides.
He calls into question to what extent French policymakers (and the intellectual elite, who are so passionately guarding the separation of church and state) are really committed to pluralism.
It suggests that Muslims may be treated rougher than Catholics, Protestants and Jews who in turn had to make their historical compromise with secular Republicanism.
He recognizes a "stiffening of the screws of values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most untolate view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them melts at alarming speed and takes life with it that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the North icon, the polar bear, in "On Thin Ice".
Immortal in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of the Arctic researchers who have proven themselves in the hunt for the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea, who fought only with the rifle cetti of his muskete, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears who were caught when they swam behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th 75 polar bears showed one performance.
Even today, zoo facilities typically still have one millionth of the lifetime area of an old animal living. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has become completely green from the algae that grow in the hollow hair of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the castle continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile Inuit use powerful assault rifles to bring down their prey.
Ironically, the ice will remain the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic science and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not about that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmosphere scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of declaration attempts.
The pioneer trips of Fridtjof Nansen in late 19th and beginning of the 20th For the first time, the swirling of the pack ice could be guessed for the first time.
Submarines measured the shifting ridges when driving underdren during the Cold War.
A useful addition are satellite surveys and the large-scale spreading of measuring probes on ice mountains, but still much is achieved by intrepid people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the influx system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater rinnals that are compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic miracles in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice once passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months ... this could be We"
Marines were among the 6,000 who layed wreaths in Arlington
The upper-released De'Angello Robinson travelled by bus for seven hours to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines, who took the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the national cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women, in whose footsteps they stepped.
In a few months, from where we are brought back from, we could be that, Robinson said about the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to place wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, in Battery Park in New York and at the United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than 150,000 dollars for the purchase and transport of the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said that she had made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this is her path to give back to something that victims brought.
She said this is a small contribution on how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It is like a visit to a family grave.
Wrapped in vineyards of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2nd World war and the Vietnam War as a goal, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, said the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held their hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the grey tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red ribbon attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained virtually quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the dark mood of the current wars met this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends held on to each other in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white square maps that had been inserted into damp mud for those whose gravestones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears before the grave of her son.
She travelled 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infranterie senser, David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'ven't stay a long time, I want someone to remember him."
US government contractors arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a US government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, said representatives of the State Department on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for customers such as USAID, the US authority for international development and for the World Bank.
Consular officers from the U.S. Interests Section in Havana try to gain access to the detainee who will reach access on the 5th of the was arrested on December.
The special charges have not yet been published, although according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost everything that can be accused of "endangering."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include minor protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor will likely increase tensions between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement with the island's relations.
The news of the arrest was reported on Friday night of the New York Times.
The new US policy attaches great importance to the United States providing consideration when the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is 15 dollars per month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are actually used to send text messages, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely limited on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some government agencies, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to register their names frequently.
Access to many websites is limited.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few US citizens who are in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press spokesperson for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the distribution of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", which recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Equal Cuba", an affluent of Raul Castro as the leader of the country, who replaced the suffering older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the defendants are very often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned within one day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards each other for more dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday an alleged head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers and said that they hope that this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who search the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said that they had looked for an opaque insurgent member, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found them because one of them on the online video page had made comments on terrorist attacks.
After their arrival in Pakistan, Saifullah became the leader of these men and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and his terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence agency who was informed of the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the Al Qaeda leaders that men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern town of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
Therefore, they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged by a way and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by the Pakistani law enforcement agencies.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and are being surveyed by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly more important in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of 11. In September 2001, the US intelligence service has made it a matter of great urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special test by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US goals and their propaganda value, they are also considered tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest-ranking analyst of the NEFA Foundation based in the USA, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years with regard to whom they allow access, because the US intelligence services have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to inject someone into these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based much more on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of demonstrators call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of demonstrators marched through the streets here on Saturday and demanded more bolder action on climate protection from the negotiators in the Bella Congress Centre of the city.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people had joined the event, whereas the police estimates were more likely to date from about 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists lit small explosive devices near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day, when the UN-sponsored climate negotiations did not happen, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners standing in English, "There is no planet B" and one in Spanish, which declared "The Earth says "Enough".
Some stars joined the protest, such as the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother's country's country's native country, are aware of the heartbreaking problems that the country is facing due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the large demonstration - to pass the floor and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way to lead around it.
The police stopped the demonstrators from getting too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carried pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named, as he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked demonstrators in black clothing ignited several explosive devices near the Copenhagen main channel, where several ministries are located nearby.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flare-up missiles, but were then followed by "a few large explosions."
Inside the congress centre, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether he thinks that the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not aware of".
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they are disturbing the negotiations or the freedom of others."
Test data show persistent breed breath
The testimonies of math performance were welcome good news for public schools in Washington D last week. C.
Although Washington District is still far behind the country's schools that produce peak performance, the testimonies show that the fourth and eight-level plumbers have made faster progress over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago, and New York.
What is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national level.
The average score of the white fourth graders from Washington D. C. has risen from 262 to 270 in the last two years (on a scale of 500), but their African-American peers rose by only three points from 209 to 212.
The power gap actually rose from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of the African-American eight-graders was basically the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, since the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was hit in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has increased during this period, the difference has now barely decreased, with 58 points.
Some educational advocates of the district expressed last week concern that the results held by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty have been celebrated, mostly white students who are already powerful children, have been promoted.
This indicates that we have raised the overall rating by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, board member of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group who worked for education in Washington D. C. occurs.
I do not step up and settle for a range of two or three points, said the Democratic Washington City Council member Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Primary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the examination scores is that the city's middle schools need urgent attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What is frightening me, however, is that we do not ever devote the time and energy we need to use for our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-power students.
This fall, for example, some teachers will be trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which targets students in the upper classes of primary and middle school, what basic skills of reading did not master at the beginning of their school leaving career and which are significantly behind their age-worthy classmates.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games from kindergarten to sixth grade games and lifelike experiences, was brought to Washington under former school inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I believe that we must continue to work to benefit the best actions for students who are below the grade level, said Rhee.
Others say that NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can proceed to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide additional money and resources for the low-performing schools that are necessarily to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who examines urban exam scores.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political after-effects working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, is, as with other urban school inspectors, that she tries to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we are building a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements to close the power gap is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
The school year needs to be raised to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year for 185 days a year, which he considers to be "a milestone" on the way to a greater increase in the next treaty.
Higher education for more people than prospects for the future
The coach reaches the Gettysburg College with a noisy pipe.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, rises and blinks a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald lawn.
Graciela's parents have barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth-graders of the group exploring Gettysburg, where the lessons cost 38,690 dollars per year, was more that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon," shouted Graciela, who would like to study medicine, as the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when the school's low professor-to-student ratio was reported to her.
The college in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully accepted the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children of hipanic immigrants born in the USA who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to rise to the middle class.
In truth, one in five of these "second generation" of Hispanic Americans enters college – which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the USA without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, say researchers, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who examine powerful children say they often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role by gracizing and millions of children as they help to come to college, especially when these efforts persist for a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure will not solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, who examined Hispanic American students.
We need to think about providing a supporting network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal programme, which Graciela's College Tour had financed, is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - Up a gear and provides more than 300 million dollars a year for local school systems to start college preparation programs that start when low-in students are in middle school and continue until they have completed the high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, of which more than 60% have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies were only able to record shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which started on Friday.
The only company that has placed a bid has drawn shortening.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies are leading Asian and European, said Ruba Husari, the publisher of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns underlined by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday, and the political instability of the withdrawal of the U.S. military have probably prevented American oil companies from becoming more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven oil reserves in the world.
US companies were in some cases at a disadvantage because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they do not have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to sign contracts with the Ministry.
Major US companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, who maintain close relations with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been supporting technical advice in recent years, have gone empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The China state-owned National Petroleum Corporation has provided for more contracts than any other company and could go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said Oil Department spokesman Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to becoming one of the big players in the world economy and a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its fellow cyclists and will fulfil its commitments to Iraq.
For the bid delivery pre-selected companies, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil, which the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top al Qaeda appropriators were killed this week, reported representatives of the US fight against terrorism on Friday.
This would be, if it were confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior leader of the terrorist organisation this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were allegedly killed by a number of missiles who hit their vehicle on Tuesday near the city of Miran Shah in the northern Wazirist province.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a drone type used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They drove in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a poster official from a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Local residents who are suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the spot and quickly took everything left over from the "completely destroyed bodies."
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism commanded indefinite evidence that Somali was a dead.
Somali was described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, who led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noticed a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate character of the US air strikes on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes its central role as given, it also included the planning of attacks against the USA and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Qaeda and implemented them in operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. officials said that Somali had quickly risen in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained the best ties with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second official, but this does not reduce the risk he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader who has been killed since September when a similar attack was killed by Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The pace of CIA drone attacks has declined from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a non-profit organization.
The decline can be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability and at the same time brutally kill suspicious informants, the side reported.
Leading UN envoy to Kabul will resign
The leading UN envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, ending a stormy term that was tarnished by claims of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The sake of shock takes place when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 US soldiers to Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the military elevation, but he also expressed his concerns that the US military withdrawal plan, which is due to begin in 18 months, could force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces, thereby sending the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian workers to help with the political changeover of Afghanistan.
The military increase in the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign, but only held an agreement reached in March 2008 to his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now forward so that he has time to provide a replacement.
What I have said is that he better starts to seek a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN representatives, Ban has begun finding a substitute.
The UN representatives say that he considered the Swedish-Italian Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and considered the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eid's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who in September had accused him of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the presidential election in the country and covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide has rejected all the allegations, but he also said that the accusations of Galbraith - who was fired - "had undoubtedly hurt the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism regarding international intervention in the election."
Eide said that he had recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the aid measures of the American armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership allowed his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence in their money being used correctly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN setting regulations have undermined its ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that I have only been able to hire one person since May, he said.
This is disastrous and must not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran faces additional sanctions
Defence Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that the world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" over Iran because it did not participate in talks about its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke to a group of approx. during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq 300 US soldiers in northern Iraq and lowered the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good opportunities to choose from Iran, he said in response to the question of a soldier on the likelihood of such development.
"One of the things that lie on my soul is, if we have learned something from Iraq in the last six years, which are unpushable for the war."
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average rider.
He said that a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the American government affected the European leaders in the warning that Iran will have to expect "credible" consequences if it does not meet its nuclear program with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear supervisory organisation, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran continues to claim that the knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1st Iran said on October that it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear programme and would refrain from a substantial part of its stock of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
However, Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since that time -- in part, experts say because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran simply left the international community with some of the proposals it agreed to early October, has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they have never been linked to important additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has said the 31. Dec., as a deadline set for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those who once called Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton "impressing sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's representation to the United Nations condemned what it called "groundless and unfound claims" of some of the Security Council members on Iran's nuclear activities on Thursday, saying that they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve an appropriate long-term solution."
Gates, who was to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flewing to the oil-rich Kurdish region in Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish authorities in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent US plans from reducing American troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also tried to dispel the Kurdish concern about the impending withdrawal of troops. US representatives quoted Gates, who to Masud Barzani, President of the Kurdish Regional Government, said: "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change in the ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters who gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons have learned them so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change the course this summer due to the low birth rate and the older population this summer, encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: "No less."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a head of the staff with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously thick, disrepaired individual children, who are affectionately called "little emperor," a population crisis in the country is drawing up.
The average birth rate is at 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time when this policy came into force, the UN sites
Population Department, while the number of the population group is expected to rise from 16.7% of the population in 2020 from 16.7% of the population to 31.1 percent by 2050. This is far above the global average of approx. 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people identified almost 22 percent of Shanghai's registered residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of enjoyable age must have to receive babies "to help reduce the ratio of the ageing populations and alleviate the labour shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich as the industrialised countries like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial disposition that has been introduced by the ruling Communist Party to this day.
Married couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines -- until their threefold annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination at their jobs.
Chinese state officials have attributed it to this policy that the critical claim of natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in enforcing politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also performed gender-selective abortions, creating an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city residents, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife were unique children -- and in 2007 the tone of many hard slogans was mitigated.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Department of Population Research at Beijing University, said that government officials have even discussed more radical changes recently, for example, to allow couples to two children where a partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters taught families of having only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines that describe in detail who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at home and push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial counseling for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, said family planning representatives.
Disappointing response
Although officials from a small rural town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that there is an upturn in the applications of couples who want a second child after the launch of the campaign, the city districts, however, are not reporting any change.
For example, the municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are received per month.
Dismissed Shanghai officials say that the number of births expected for 2010 in the city still at approx. The number of 45,000 will be -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai community Caolu, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want more children.
They want to give their first the best, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like to have two children and that this is legally permitted.
But, like many Chinese, they own only a minor health and life insurance company.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West falsely rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of us the opportunity to have more than one child.
However, the problem is not simply a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of the staff, said she only wants one child because she was also an only child. "We were the focus of the family and lived that everyone took care of us.
We are not used to taking care of others and do not really want it."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it blurred.
For parents from the middle class with a double career, which decreases the birth rate, he said, it is about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of the 20 to 39-year-olds today grew up seeing their parents fighting during the early days of the Chinese experiment on capitalism, and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the question of space -- "You have to rebuild your home" -- and life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a resume for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to reach a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group designs plan to reduce emissions
The climate conference promoted by the UN -- which has so far been characterised by wild poses and mutual accusations -- has again set a focus on the publication of a document on Friday, which is recording an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialised nations having to shoulder the greatest burden in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a definitive political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as an important step forward in a negotiation that comes down to the time, as more than 100 leaders from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the money supply, which rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrialised and large emerging economies can restrict their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature increase that policymakers would be supported.
The process is given great flexibility, said John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarised a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN leading climate protection representative, Yvo de Boer, has described as "the big picture".
It shows the floor plan of a possible agreement, where the industrialised nations would jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also boosted the talks on Friday with an assurance that it will provide USD 3.6 billion per year for the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday nevertheless brought the same verbal fireworks that the talks had determined last week.
The American Special Representative Todd Stern has rejected wording that demand binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if they are not financed by the industrialised nations.
This train announced that the Obama administration was driving a tougher line with China as a representative of the Bush administration less than two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, says Stern, who also complained that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave up his statement one hour after the statement by Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei, who said that the leading American climate negotiator either lacked "reason" or was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially manage global warming.
The fact that the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake have come to a standstill lines both within the industrialised nations and between the industrialised nations and the emerging economies.
The current struggle refers equally to saving individual economies, as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States making themselves because of their commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take more courageous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprising that the big powers are struggling to cover who should bear the costs of braking greenhouse gas emissions, since even affected countries have managed to be more aggressive in holding the countries with very high greenhouse gas emissions to account for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, said Ulate, who also works as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change said that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although the leaders say that the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The alliance of small island states with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of the small island states is "policy pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and call for action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues need to be resolved before the arrival of government leaders in order to reach an agreement.
High-ranking representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Deputy Minister, emerged from their planes and raced through the Bella Center's corridors to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake claims that will be negotiated during the next week.
The extent of the meeting -- 13,000 people go into and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists hold night shows, in which they make fun of the countries that they think reveal and sell, and contract designs are passed on by hand to hand instead of e-mail -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is only just building up: almost all important ministers are now here and from Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the Higher League, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice President for Global Politics of the Conservation International Organization.
The heavyweights come.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines the feeling of Monday
At 5 a.m. at 5 a.m. 1st a whistling will penetrate the darkness to announce a train departure that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will be headed by Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras reach 225 km/h and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, Dame Kelly Holmes will then board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will ultimately connect to an international rail network faster, more reliable trains and will connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the north and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become living commuter towns, working days would be radically reduced, and the switch from airplane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road traffic jams.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the unavoidable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still pull the brakes on British high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to present a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will report on the 30th anniversary, according to the Times. December.
This gives it a detailed route map of the next planned level of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which is to connect London with the West Midlands, will lead with five-metre scope to urban areas and locations where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 metres from the final line.
HS2 is also intended to create three options for a larger, northward leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide in or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another would head northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best working option," said a railway insider.
After completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section that would not be opened before 2025 would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes compared to today, just over an hour.
The designs gave trains the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, which would make the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first line was designed so that 400 metres of trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can drive on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham line.
This, in turn, would mean that a terminus would be needed in London where 20,000 travelers could be handled per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he believes that this plan should be continued or not, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will only be taken after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
Trains would first have to move from high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be the travel time between London and Scotland over three hours.
This is considered a decisive crunching point to ensure a change from the aircraft to the railways, a point of view of the rail revolution.
Taxpayers arrive on a conservative mortgage for 75,000 pound orangeria
Alan Duncan, the leading member of the Conservative House, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery that he had built in his constituency in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, which was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the lower house have to live "from lean rations," increased his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to have an oak-framed plant build on his second house in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer for the additional interest revenue, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The heads of the lower house approved the applications at that time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who carries out a review of the expenses of the lower house members. Last night Duncan said that the applications could have been "not even cleaner or more understandable".
Duncan, one of the richest members of the lower house, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have earned a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, an expedition checkpoint of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he cultivated a conservatory, which is described in the plans as "Orangerie".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
During a recent investigation into its previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee, Duncan was not asked to comment on increased borrowing.
The committee acquitted him of the breach of the rules last month after an investigation of his expenditure.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage of 271,406 pounds (300,000 euros) from his London house to his constituency building, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
Documents published this week show that Duncan received a refund of about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month as mortgage interest by March of last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (EUR 2,000) per month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the entire increase was used to finance the borrowing of 75,000 pounds (EUR 85,000).
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim its right to 1,250 pounds (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as an opposition leader in the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him when he said after the spending scandal that members of parliament would "live rations."
"Essentially, when working for the state, it means that you have to live on meager rations and treat how S*****e is treated."
He said, "I have spent my money on my garden and claim to a tiny portion, measured by what is his own.
And I could have demanded all the damn sum, but I don't do it."
MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his spending when it became clear that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this could be "considered an exaggerated demand."
An activist dug a hole in the form of a pound sign as a protest in Duncan's lawn after it became known that he had claimed 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) for three years.
When asked about the raised mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fees Office and Legg for the increase in value."
He added: "There is no debate about evasion and pernching or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come to all your believers to admire Brighton's beach huts Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new lifelong life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme every December day.
The event started on the 1st December and visitors were allowed to watch the newest hut every day from 5:30 pm to 6:30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas carols selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first NoÃol", where the smelting decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a Chichester diocese volunteer diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important for the people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we expect people as a church to come into a strange old building? I think the Church should go to the people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and lively place and we try to express it through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against global warming, where the police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organisers, have marched in the coldness of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which should lead to a conclusion by Friday that could come into effect from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the climate conference, the increasing mobilisation in the world for the climate is contributing to what these demonstrators demonstrate that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, smashed display windows with paving stones and hammers, founded an AFP journalist.
Anti-restened police officers intervened immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, were arrested in eastern France, in April, of these extremely violent fly groups, who have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, has criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has underlined that some hundred of you were "always held in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in position.
The rather peaceful train has gone from Parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the building without trying to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the scheduled speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the demonstrators came with bowls and trains from the large European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
Approximately 3,000 people, most of them with sky-blue raincoats, made a first crowd in the morning in Copenhagen, since you followed the call of the Earth's friends to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice".
Today we take to the streets to demand reparations of the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, filippine activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot continue like this and tell us: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, watercourses where you can walk as it has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of critics of globalisation has come closer to the environmental organisations.
MEP José Bové, the figure of the critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to combine "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate warming and the struggle for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly vulnerable as a result of warming, has spent the launch of the demonstrations.
According to the organizers in Australia, around 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila there were several hundred people, mostly students marching into red and hoisting bandanas, where you praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Djakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred protesters took place in order to demand a vigorous approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces that this is a "patch".
Abkhazia elected his president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow had recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "stretch".
About 131,000 people were called upon to participate in the first election after the Russo-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist area recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 pm GMT.
Voter turnout was a few hours before the polling station closure, according to the Abkhaz electoral commission managers.
The first premature results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the former president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian President, Mikheil Saakakhvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a safe total cast, his press secretary, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is legally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousands of people killing, Abkhazia wants to prove through this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has declared Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to choose a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a nice white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the Black Sea.
Great signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian President and Head of Government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, that has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the election.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially with regard to the decision to recognise Abkhazia's self-employment.
I hope that your country will soon be recognised by the United Nations, Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian Parliament, said and has spent a glass of vodka.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former Vice-President and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticised the agreements with Moscow last year, as the one in which Abkhazia Russia leaves the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of voting must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police have arrested about 700 people at all times, on the edge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousands of people according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which receives the delegates from 193 countries by 18 December, who are looking for an agreement to enter into force on 1January 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations are taking place.
The demonstrators stopped about 500 metres from the centre and did not try to penetrate.
A stage was set up to welcome the planned speakers for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Some moments after the train had passed, a group of demonstrators dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers started to strike, sitting down, a journalist found the AFP.
Anti-restless policemen immediately encircled you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent fly groups, who have already made themselves famous at the Nato Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April.
In the evening, during the incidents in which, according to the police, about twenty people were temporarily arrested, a policeman suffered an injury to the chin by a paving stone. Four vehicles burned near a occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen, while the helicopters of the police forces were circulating in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who travelled by train or with their own vehicles from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or from Milan were European.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to form a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say more: we still have time," says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that run dry, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before."
The first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the Movement of Encounters with Globalisation has come closer to environmental protection organisations.
The French MEP and globalisation critic José Bové told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no difference today between the fight against global warming and the struggle for another world."
The Oxfam organization has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly susceptible to global warming, has provided the impetus for the demonstrations.
According to the organizers, in Australia, there are approx. 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed red with bandanas, have advertised the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of demonstrators have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the demonstrations organised by the "Net of 350", especially in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and in Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history are strongly developed by the school reform of the Lycéen.
In an interview that appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", the national education minister Luc Chatel explained that geography and history are stronger from the school reform of the Lycé, even if they were in the Terminals (12. School year) are not mandatory.
"The students of the premier (11. School year) now have every four weekly hours and the same programme," confirms Mr Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocriticality must be overcome", because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but on the whole a concentration of "the best student."
"The economic-social and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued. He underlined: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who were outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals on technical lyceas."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French (69%) the state project of cancelling mandatory teaching in history and geography in Terminale S (12. school year with scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals also complained about this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister answered, however, that there was no question of restricting the philosophy of the programme of Terminals S.
Luc Chatel also defended the educational reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for a protest against the project for Tuesday, which, in their opinion, the educational training of future teachers falls victim.
The Minister said that they are subject to a subject-related aptitude test in the Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admission examination, during which their teaching skills are examined.
They also conduct internships during the year in the M2 and then teach a year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued to say, "If you add all the internships offered before the performance examination, you will achieve even more hours you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The Minister finally declared that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed once again that he wanted to abolish the school card "until 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the operation at the Copenhagen Summit is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure on Rue d’Ulm in Paris.
As a journalist from the AFP found, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, where experts turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
One wants to do something to achieve what one achieves people and awakens in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of that day, on the edge of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name that the students gave to the fish in the school basin.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants in the debate were selected, even after their charisma," he specifies.
"You can speak for hours about global warming. However, the core objectives can also be set out in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of the AFP, which approx. 50 people spoke freely only with the help of slides.
"This is part of our role as a scientist," he underlined in the hope that the audience will take the effect that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be released from the 15th conferences onwards To be found online on the school website in December.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will then take place every two months.
Late payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of the penitentiary officers called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the premiums and overtime, whose pay was postponed until January for budget reasons, is transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2. The union of prison officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire") called on the employees, who have no service, to demonstrate before the prison on Tuesday morning and to block it in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled".
The 3. Union of Prison Officers ("CGT-Péntiaire") called for "to unite to a strong mobilisation in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of the overtime, night supplements and Sunday and holiday surcharges in December is being burned as "hameful and unacceptable" in December.
The first union of the prison officials, the Autonomous Federal Penal Service Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The management of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice declared that overtime increased sharply in 2009 and not all of them were scheduled in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michéle Alliot-Marie sent a letter to the unions of the penitentiary officers, in which it is guaranteed that the payment will be made in the next month.
"I am well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our penal system functional and modernise it," the Minister of Justice says in this letter.
"I have instructed the management of the penitentiary to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen from a lack of assessment of the overtime experience, does not repeat itself in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore meagre, except for the management staff, who benefit from high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "household constrictions" have to serve.
"This is an absolute scandal," says the interregional trade union FO in Marseille, announcing that "all meetings and convenings" should be boycotted until new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and public holidays when the hours of October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rhone-Alpes-Auvergne is also facing.
"At a time when more and more tasks are being imposed on us without hiring more staff, the attempt to enrich themselves with the funds of the staff is more than inappropriate," says the CGT trade union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, the Secretary General of the UFAP, states Jean-Francois Forget.
Obama believes he distributes Christmas ever better gifts than he himself gets.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has talked about TV talk master Oprah Winfrey that he distributes ever better gifts than he himself gets.
During a special broadcast broadcast on Sunday evening via the ABC channel, the President and his wife Michelle gave an insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the party.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," says Michelle Obama, adding that the dog will of course also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama firmly rejected her husband's claims to the quality of the gifts. "I have given you nice gifts last year," she teaches the president.
"So please," he said mischievously, pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady : "And who gave them there?"
During this one-hour broadcast in a casual atmosphere with the well-known television presenter, whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they loved the most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-course bicycle and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought from Kenya at Christmas.
"I remember when my father once visited us at Christmas and brought me a basketball," said the president.
"It was only much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from it."
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her doll's house.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace. But I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle told Obama.
Johnny Hallyday reoperates, RTL confirms that he was put into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was revived in Los Angeles for considerable "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people around him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician resumed surgery on Wednesday from Wednesday to Thursday at the hospital in Cedars-SinaÃ3 in Los Angeles, after the American doctors "Damage due to the operation of a herniated disc", which he had on 26 February. In November, had suffered, had been diagnosed, including its production company in Paris, which added that these damage had required another operation.
The singer's production company nevertheless made it clear that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
According to RTL, the partner during the singer's last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, only after 48 guests had a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
When the AFP requested, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "certain sources show that "no drainage" was laid after its first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a herniated disc.
The procedure planned for several days was performed by the neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available for comments to RTL on Thursday night.
After the operation of Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted to the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was of the opinion opposite RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that there was a need to "don't worry" about the rock musician, since he was "a good fighter".
"He called me before his departure for Los Angeles. I told him that it was bullshit to sit on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, it would not go," said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday evening, the producer of the singer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well on antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained".
Mr. Camus also explained that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any particular concern.
Nevertheless, the singer's concern for the health of the singer had become greater and greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after he had fallen on his yacht.
Two months later, there was general surprise that Johnny Hallyday had a "little colon cancer surgery", whereupon a minor infection occurred.
At the end of September, the singer resumed his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour as planned.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists did not miss the fact that the singer on stage has had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to be admitted to the hospital again.
Euro-2009/Short track: First place for Bousquet over its favourite distance
The Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the World Swimming Championships 2009, won an international title over his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, when the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while a real record flood was expected.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the large tank (20.94).
At one of the two shirts in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman held himself in 20,53 sec, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at an international level.
Bousquet defeated the Croats Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can believe in ever greater bigger things and in the present case I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all floats started in polyurethane suits, starting from the 1. January 2010 are prohibited.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which first began in the same competition in 1999.
This time, the use of the combination did not pay off for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and a world record.
The young swimmer did not manage to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give everything this time.
I knew that I could not win a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job."
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA : grave slab at Zola estimated at 1.5 million US dollars
A Roman grave slab, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, of all places, was founded on Thursday to 1.5 million. US dollar estimated at its value, according to the art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates from the III. century AD and was always rated at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble depicting "four scenes of Dionysus in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrene and bacuch figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five in the world," Florent Heintz, Vice President for Roman and Egyptian Antiquities at Sotheby's, said on Tuesday opposite the AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most for so far," says Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy to the AFP.
The discovery of this acquisition of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family, after which she dipped piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and to Paul Reynaud, Minister in III. French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
When browsing the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Erbe by Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "ThérÃ3se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's exit test from Honduras to Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico declared the terms for the transfer of the overthrown Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil as nothing more compatible after this congression by the coup government had rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place at night, everything seems to be indicated at the moment that there is a lack of the opportunity to execute this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authority, the aircraft imposed by the Mexican government is on Wednesday in Salvador for the purpose of transfer M. Zelayas had arrived to return to his departure location.
The coup government wanted M. Zelaya necessary for "absending" and requesting political asylum for him abroad.
However, the fallen president refused, as he wished to return to Mexico as the greeted, reigning head of state.
The Putsch regime "has suffered another failure by trying to get me on my own cost (...), they wanted me to abject," said M. M. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has often spoken out since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and ten years, here I have my guitar, added the overthrown president, who had taken refuge in the Brazilian message of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, under attacks of some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for escort, which unfortunately we cannot accept, since it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, Minister of the Interior of the Putsch government, told the Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not ask for asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only undertake as President of the Honduran people.
The rumours about an exit M. Zelayas had mobilized on Wednesday the supporters of the overthrown president who had opened the Brazilian embassy and gathered around them, whereupon the military there had increased its deployment.
The Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the position of the coup government.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had come closer to the socialist Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, was on the 28th anniversary of the president of the city. June, on the day of the referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress, was overthrown.
From his exile in Costa Rica he was on the 21st of his exile in Costa Rica. Suddenly returned to the Brazilian embassy in September and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves them, he is imprisoned for high treason, of which he is accused by the judiciary, says the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti has succeeded in making a presidential election on 29. Novemberzu organize to M. Zelaya to replace.
Porfirio Lobo was recognised by the United States during the controversial election, while Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argeninia or Brazil were rejected.
Three days later, the cogress had massive against M. Zelaya's return to office until the end of his mandate on 27 June. January voted.
Wall Street on the upswing, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York stock exchange concluded on Thursday with a high, the figures on the US trade balance show that the stocks are recurated by the United States stocks and their partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of the stock market, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the Nasdaq, which is dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 was contacted at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,103.35 points.
There is good news from various sectors of the economy, said Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market focuses only on "semi-full glasses", so it moderated.
According to the Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the figures of the US trade balance, "which showcase an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States' trade deficit fell by 7.6% to 32.9 billion dollars in October compared to September.
The analysts had, by contrast, expected deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The great news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in the export of goods, which reflects the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, said Christopher Cornell of corporate research Economy.com.
In return, unemployed reports in the United States have increased against all expectations in the last week, and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new jobseekers has "at the lowest of the year over the past four weeks," stressed Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The profitability of government bonds to 10 years has risen to 3.4822% compared to the 3.332% on Tuesday evening, with bond profitability to 30 years to 4.492% compared to the 4.480% from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of parents in power whistle "ladies in white"
A few hundreds of Pakistani partisans, who were wiped out the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on Thursday for the purpose of the World Day of Human Rights, and also thwarted another rally, which was temporarily arrested for a good dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "ladies in Weiss", wives or loved political prisoners, were whistled on the open streets of partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the walk to the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist from the AFP confirmed.
Down with the Yankies!, "Söldner!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fiddle and Raul live!" the empowered partisans chanted with the elevated fist towards the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "ladies in Weiss" took place on the eve of which there were neither injured nor arrests.
In the Havendo district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also set out on Thursday's demonstration in view of International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by plainclothes police officers, confirmed an AFP reporter.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents hijacked by the government's partisans to enter civilian vehicles under their violence.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
When candidates for the Sakharov Prizes awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "women in white" have organized an unauthorized march for the purpose of "Ask for the release of all political prisoners, the number of which has around 200 people according to the list of dissidents," said Laura Pollan, a leader whose husband Hector Maceda serves a prison term of 20 years.
M. Maceda is one of the groups of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom have been 53 behind bars to date.
The Cuban authorities perceive the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
One rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported the demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and "counterrevolutionaries" taking place on Thursday.
Cuba, which is headed by a unitary party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of denigrating rights and freedoms, in particular that of freedom of expression.
Mader kills eighty-year-old with the knife and leaves 5 injured people in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old on Friday on a late afternoon during the peak business in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) and injured five other people.
According to the first information in the questioning, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives, and this, according to police details, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a person in charge of the police syndicate Alliance, has succluded the consequences of his injuries in the hospital.
In or in front of the pharmacy he has picked up a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, roughly in the threesome, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were severely injured, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person's lives is in danger of their lives, since, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become evil as a result of the events and, according to a source of police, she is said to have been hospitalized in the "shock state".
The armed man, who according to police claims seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drug, was said to have escaped the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had hurt two more passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-sick and a forty-year-old, the latter of both severe.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher's knives, which he wore crossed behind his back, explained Arnaud Pressé, a member of the syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
According to the testimonies of the witness reports derived by the AFP, several passers-by, including young people, are said to have tried to tame the madman.
I saw a guy in the threesome with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, told Alberto, a waiter at an nearby bar.
A horde has attacked him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at number 61, two city police, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stabbing, according to police details.
The event has taken place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where there are a number of stores.
Passersby approached me to tell me that there is an injured person.
I left and I have seen a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I have taken it to first aid office and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, the AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person, fell injured by cuts.
The emergency services of the state police finally arrested the man who did not carry any identity documents.
The Nanterre public prosecutor's office has commissioned the District Department of the Criminal Police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The madman was hospitalized on Thursday evening.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not exclude that he is being sent to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it said six policemen to tame him at the police centre in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He found himself "in a state of supersation" like "all the spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the event."
USA: Polanski's lawyer calls for cessation of prosecution again
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has once again demanded that on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western the United States) fall on prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial in Switzerland due to a moral shock of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, attorney of the director of the "Pianist", denounced gross procedural errors in the contract in the second district of California in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal.
I call on the place penalities, M. Hummel, before he added that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "let one run down your back cold".
In accordance with him, the - now deceased - judge Rittenband, before he fell his judgment, had discussed with a prosecutor who is said to have told him that Roman Polanski had deserved prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and coveted), especially by the prosecutor David Wells who is in question.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had the authors of the documentary film "belogen".
If the Court refuses to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requires the holding of a trial which would enable him to provide the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the argument already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the offences accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the USA in 1978, even before the proclamation of the penalty for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has not travelled to the USA since then.
The deputy prosecutor of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, had declared that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Do you want to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants that escape is a way to escape?
In their opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court to delight and despise his authority."
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even emphasised "that there are other alternatives to flight."
Hummel was not the only one who had requested that the prosecution had stopped against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the cancellation of the criminal proceedings once again.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by every resurgence of the affair Polanski, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was just.
Thirty-two years are enough."
Roman Polanski was born on 26th September in Switzerland, arrested at the instigation of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to the house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, pending a possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed down by the rise of the dollar and ends without price.
The New York stock market closed without price on Friday in a market torn between better indicators than the US intended and an increase in the dollar: the Dow Jones won 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq gave 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor's 500 has risen by 0.37% (4,06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," said Mace Blicksilver from Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains narrowly limited, the volume of trade has become very low and I think that this will remain so by the end of the year."
The tendency was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than planned, which "helped to improve the market view to the solidity of the recovery of the economy," summarised the analysts of Charles Schwab.
In the United States, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than planned.
Furthermore, American consumer confidence improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 last month, according to the Index Preview of the University of Michigan.
However, the indexes have been slowed down by a new rise in the dollar exchange rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro for two months, which means that the sectors are vulnerable to the economic situation are pushing down," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some of the ground.
The bond market has declined.
The treasury of the treasury bond over 10 years rose by 3.400% on Wednesday evening, compared to 3.482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4.497% compared to 4.492% of the previous day.
Election of Miss World in South Africa again
After a month's round trip through South Africa, the 112 candidates will exceed the last hurdle for the Miss World on Saturday to realize her dream: being elected the most beautiful woman in the world and this in front of a billion television spectators.
During this major beauty fair, which is held for the second time in a row in the area of Johannesburg, five of them have already reached their semi-final ticket.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true whirlpool of pleasures.
Beautiful towns to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Hoorn, was simply exceptional.
I have seen many things and had a lot of experience!, said Miss Sierra Leone with full enthusiasm.
This competition will be held in South Africa for the ninth time and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, from 5pm (15 clock Central European Time).
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchange of experiences with candidates and the rediscovery of "breath-raising landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
The Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as eming Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both Bollywoodstars.
It is, of course, every woman's dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, discards India with a big smile.
According to the organizers, this will be 59. Edition with music and dance underlined.
The candidates are decorated in traditional costumes and not to forget in a swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, Chinese Angela Chow, from the ex-Beauty Queen of South Africa, Michelle McLean and a person in charge of the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows that it knows the world with a dirty and pride that can hardly be surpassed, assures Julia Morley, chair of Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, made a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time they tasted a bike and the local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them their hands, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, the draw in Cape Town (South-West) to the football World Cup in June 2010, remains a type of country to promote this event a little more.
I am wrong with people I whom I probably could never approach otherwise.
I will certainly come back to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastically Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
The news of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday when he arrived at the airport in Los Angeles, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for a few days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, explained to the press when he left the plane when he left the plane, arriving shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21:00 CET).
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "fastly" go to the hospital of Cedars-Sina, to which Johnny Hallyday on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after an operation at a herniated disc on the 26th an end. was admitted to Paris in November.
The singer was "turning this night in Los Angeles to an artificial coma to relieve his severe pain and carry out his treatment," announced the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-SinaÃ1⁄2 hospital in Los Angeles, in which he was involved on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after intervertebral disc surgery on 26 February. was admitted to Paris in November.
The singer had to undergo another operation on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes that were caused by the last surgery.
His wife Laeticia participated in a school event at the French Gymnasium in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, a photographer of the AFP stated.
The head of the orthopaedic and traumatological surgery department at Yves Catoné, the head of the Department of Orthopaedic and Traumological Surgery, in Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles Hospital on Monday.
The producer has the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who the singer on 26th November in the Clinique international du parc Monceau in Paris, had a hard burden.
We were told that he had caused the purest massacre.
The surgeons of Los Angeles said they were completely indignant, Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that a trial may be initiated, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled much too fast and this has travelled to Los Angeles with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I personally talked to this doctor, who assured me that he considers this trip to be completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I myself already have two intervertebral disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artistic milieu.
He had actress Marie Trintignant , operating a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007 he also had actress Charlotte Gainsbourg on surgery to resorb a hematoma after a cerebral haemorrhage.
However, he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has been sentenced several times due to unsuccessful operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, attorney at the medical association, described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" to the board of directors and was "everything other than recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi, cancelled a statement.
The latter explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and that the post-operative examinations would have been "normal".
The operation "does not caused bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been struck since last summer, seems to be questioned.
It is clear that it is for a continuation of the tour on 8. Mr Camus declared a little too short January (in Amiens).
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the party Nouveau Centre not to use its seal anymore
The party alliance, which is supervised by Francois Bayrou’s MoDem party, reacted heavily on Friday to an attempt by the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, from the leader of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him to use this seal in any document, under threat of judicial persecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF certificate, since he believes that Francois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political heritage after he had handed over to the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defence, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy to the NC National Council on Saturday.
To emphasise his efforts, he had received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (former UMP, now at NC), who claims the ownership of the UDF trademark, since he was the first to apply for this trademark in 2004 at the "Institut national de la propriété industrielle".
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by Francois Bayrous's friends, broke silent and made it clear to understand that they did not allow themselves to be expropriated and set a deadline for the minister and the deputy, under the threat of prosecution, not to use this seal and to transfer it the ownership rights of the trademark.
In recent days, you have made numerous statements that you would propose to your political movement, take over the UDF seal+, wrote the party alliance in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including Francois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the Czech Alliance.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + today's UDF +, on their political material and on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF office explained and asks the party NC to "demotionly remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (its) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to transfer the trademark's ownership rights to its legal rights.
If you refuse, we will bring an action against you to provide respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of the UDF members, warned the undersigned.
In their letter, they emphasize that "UDF" has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978, recalling that Morin and his friends "make the choice" to leave this in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the party "UMP".
According to the undersigned, the party Nouveau centre has no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie francaise).
They also recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 adopted the three-year entry to the MoDem party and the establishment of a office in defence of "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues, "when he had been applying for the brand name for three years, not a member of the UDF" but the UMP.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you point out that this ruthlessness is in the best way to turn into a crime, and ironize the NC's strategy: "It seems to us to make a name for itself in politics as well as in the lively way to make a name for itself, instead of trying to come out of anonymity by fraudulently taking a name on which one has no legal claims."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : Francois-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
The Nanterre Court decided on Friday to assess the artist Francois-Marie Banier to see if, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-olds to sneak up part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will be presented on 15 and 16 February. In court, April 2010 for the exploitation of weakness, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are frightened and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
Likewise, however, the 15th ordered the 15th Criminal chamber to launch a medical examination by 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially not under the conditions submitted during the investigation by the Nanterre public prosecutor's office.
The doctors appointed on Friday are scheduled to be hold before the 10th Present a report in March 2010 in which you can clearly announce whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will talk to her, explained Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the court.
This is an excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he confirmed.
For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has initiated a criminal lawsuit against Francois-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and accuses him of having exploited her mother's weakness for years in order to sneak in donations totalling one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted that he was manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-standing friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidyers of the lawyers led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has invoked three letters sent by his client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please tell my daughter that I wrote to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak with Francoise since her marriage."
The Nanterre public prosecutor's office is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to respond in this way, especially because a guardian chief judge has rejected her application in recent days to initiate a judicial protection proceeding against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
Nobody has the right to act in their place," said the representative of the prosecutor's office, Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to pass a verdict after the lawsuit of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of the Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the great French companies has been our struggle for the development of economic intelligence for in-vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of managing large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of consumers' vis-Ã -vis the consumer's marketing revolution: It is intended for staff to join "values" determined the best, as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory to impose.
By putting the customer at the center of the company, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the town ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose preferences of customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to fatal demoralisation.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that affects the employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those from R&D, which is even more decisive, to those of economic intelligence.
In fact, IE ( Intelligence Economique) demands "a proactive approach and a future-oriented view from all parties involved (...)"; it claims a commitment from the employees that the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict the instructions.
We therefore demand an operational revolution that would consist of putting the employees in the center of the company's concerns on an equal footing with the customer.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange submitted to his wage earners, stimulate this revolution in relation to management practice?
I am afraid, unfortunately not.
- First of all, because I was able to see that, in the face of a new situation, the entire structure is finally concerned with many detours, there is a priority... what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power increases proportional to the meaning of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a greatly simplified idea of human behavior.
Emerging from the large engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They adopt the old behaviorist theory through intellectual comfort, which was recently reactivated by the American "new sciences" and unknowingly widespread by research institutes and through the media.
Thus and by suggesting that it is possible to campaign the "levers" to the involvement of employees, a current survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, reinforces the executives in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is not suitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilisation factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern companies requires the adoption of a final view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a fundamental protocol into any consideration or practice of management: for the wage earners, the commitment to the company is only possible if it seems clearly a means to realize part of their dreams, their ambition and their plans.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis are taking over this conception of the motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they assess their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa that allows them to assess what it offers them to achieve their life goals through their perceived image.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the managers of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create fertile soil that is favourable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: "just war" brings Obama praises from the right
The American right welcomed the speech given by Barack Obama in Oslo on Friday on the eve of the eve and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the term "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives who were awarding the prize to Obama on 9. This time, this time the speech by the president, following the example of the former Vice-Presidential candidate in the 2008 elections in the 2008 Sarah Palin elections, applauded the speech.
I liked what he said, Palin said, said that the face of the Republican Party's right-wing wing in the USA Today daily newspaper, adding that she had herself raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary war" in her so-called memoir.
The war is, of course, the last of which I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday in Oslo, endeavoured to justify the use of force; a way to explain its decision of nine days ago, to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the present had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who especially recognized the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I found this speech completely historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed in the radio show "The Takeaway".
The previous MP, who is considered by some to be considered a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said that he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they "were not free and could not hand out a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor at the Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan," he spoke "like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they did not themselves and do not do much for the protection of which they do," said Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a falcon of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, lorry and unchallenging."
Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the return of the armed forces.
If the war is packed under the guise of the judiciary, the massacre of the innocent people is very easy to justify, he warns.
However, the media of the moderate left remains commendable alongside the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, described the speech himself for a speaker such as a "monumental work" for a speaker known to his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a schedule to manage international decisions against conflicts, poverty and oppression," the California daily said enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama proclaimed "the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Long-distance drivers: Three marathons for an agreement that secures the supply for Christmas
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the trade unions of the street association and the TLF - the only employers' organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday evening, which puts an end to the strike order and the impending difficult supply fair at Christmas.
At the signing meeting on Friday evening, Secretary of State Dominique Bussereau, responsible for transport, "welcome" the agreement that was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators separated early on Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement quickly in the late morning.
And this even though the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the meeting started at 11:00 until the agreement was concluded and the agreement was not signed until 18:00.
The conflict "had caused a lot of damage to companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," said Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a 4% increase in wages for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transports).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages therefore rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not a lot, but we're starting small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
The activists are now being instructed not to block the supply centres.
"However, there will probably always be some recalcitrants who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF leader Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to grant these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for the workers," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), whereas Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) commented on "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also includes the 3% increase in travel expenses and the upholding of total funding for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will make it possible in particular to cover the issue of 13. Address the monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the sinking of taxes for employers in the amount of EUR 100 million" was the subject of an amendment by the government to the draft law of the corrected finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government demands "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to be reached first for the companies affiliated to this organisation and that it subsequently applies to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", insured Bussereau.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association denounced "fraudulent trade", because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to annoy the goose-eaters on the approaching Christmas days, complains the UNstra.
For the Otre association, the agreement "threatens to dig a large grave to small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector over the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of RATP
The disturbances on line RER A, the largest rapid transit network in France for the greater Paris area and the Ile-de-France, continued on the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd semester. Day of strike between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris passenger transport administration), which continues to wait for strikers with their demands for wage supplements.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for operation on the central line and only one of four trains outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to communicate the large businesses in terms of transport technology".
The RER A line runs through the Parisian conurbation from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one of two trains ran as planned at peak hours, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no human rumour on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Ile-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, engineer (29), explained that he would have "set up one and a half hours early to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned the care of passengers by servants and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on line RER A or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or left via Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers' annual general meetings were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the associations had classified as "soonistic" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific elaboration of a protocol for line RER A with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long overdue wage surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself puts its pay proposals in brackets and stressed that the leadership "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the truck drivers and the SNCF."
RATP made it clear that a new meeting for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers".
In the morning, about 150 drivers went to the establishment of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership who so far rejected any discussion during the strike and suggested a meeting after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line after announcement of Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a pay fee of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they deplore the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travelling every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have many years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court announced on Friday the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party, a decision that immediately followed furious demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the south-east of the country and Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously more difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "state of activity detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," said the President of the Constitutional Court, Hasim KiliÃ four days after the decision to the press.
According to KiliÃ3 the decision would have been made unanimously by 11 judges, although a majority of seven votes would have been required to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity that boilers and Tugluk enjoy, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in the Parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders said that the parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than meet like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalsinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organisation by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, however, refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court intervenes, which is keen to accommodate the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to dry up the PKK's support by the Kurds and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a resend of tensions in south-eastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of PKK head Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with the police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of demonstrators have gathered in front of the premises of the DTP in the million city of Diyarbakir in the south-east, which is mainly populated by Kurds.
The forces of order used tear gas grenades and water cannons when the demonstrators began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision would "deepen despair even further".
"Turkey can do this (Kurdish, note. Editing) Do not clarify questions by banning a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also deplored the decision.
"We are opposing the closure of the parties on principle.
This does not solve the problems," says Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening promoted by the government," said the political market watchman Ahmet Island.
"You can obviously be tailored to a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed to become an attack in which seven soldiers were killed in northern Turkey three days earlier. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crunchy winter is what Wolfgang Brauburger wishes for.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the FES winter service manager.
But so that his employees can try out and learn to master the entire vehicle technology.
According to meteorologists, it could be ready for the first time on weekends.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds after a precise plan.
As soon as it is snowing nationwide in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero, 20 so-called A-routes with large spreading vehicles are shut down, explains Brauburger.
These include major roads and through roads such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire service, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with slopes, such as Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service begins at three in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometres would have to be scattered with moisture salt in a maximum of three hours, which sticks better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock in the morning, "so that the routes are free until the rush hour begins".
It becomes difficult when it is not snowing at 7.30 am.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then nobody is willing to make way for the scattered vehicles".
Only afterwards, if it does not snow, are its name to shuttle and access roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and secondary roads.
There will be complaints, knows Brauburger.
At five o'clock in the morning, the footmen of the FES sets off, danger points and transitions are gone first.
The FES usually cannot worry about all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which mainly keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4.30, says Brauburger.
Since there is a fast smoothness on this, as soon as the temperature falls below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, the police also call this.
The cradle of the dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50 meter-tall animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, bent teeth, short arms with sickloops and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would not be special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, say Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived in what is now New Mexico about 215 million years ago, which was located in a dry zone of the pangäa supercontinent on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
He shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other palaeontologists began an excavation at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
During the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Fund confirms theories about Dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Dinosaurulent fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these original dooms is mostly controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three most important lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and the birds, who known as "Langhälse" and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithischia trees, for example, and the species.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa is a primitive Theropode.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced qualities, says Nesbitt.
At the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, such as the descendants of the theropods, the birds, possess.
Thanks to the air sacs, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive Theropode with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the huge sauropods later also had air sacs and lightweight bones, the common ancestor of both groups had probably already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards were showing up there for the first time.
Accordingly, the three lines of development separated early on and spread from South America across all parts of the world, which at that time formed a single land mass as a supercontinent Pangäa.
This is said by the fact that the team, together with Tawa, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common, immigrant ancestry, the researchers argue.
We believe that there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner from the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs, lived in today's Poland, says the paleontologist in Bonn, Martin Sander.
His opinion could result in a distorted picture, because in South America a lot of primitive dino fossils have been preserved, while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare lateral line of the reptile trunk to the dominant land vertebrate of the Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Trias, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight dinosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the kinship died out on the border from the Triassic to the Jura.
Success story did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped a group of animals to flower, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then had a shadow existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto are based on the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna and Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin and Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University makes waves worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of Goethe University, as well as universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, show solidarity with the protesting students on Campus Westend.
In a declaration written in German and English, she "misses" the police operation initiated by the presidium.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had cleaned the building occupied by students and lecturers on an educational strike last week because walls and works of art had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The subscribers judged by the signatories did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command."
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delistitution and criminalization of protest" and distracts from the content.
The Presidium had evaded the necessary discourse.
The lecturers demand an immediate cessation of prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, it says.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German Trade Union Confederation are also showing solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's country youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse's Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU), however, defended the actions of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable funds, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We understand the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to the CDU member of parliament Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left saw otherwise.
The CDU takes painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they were cleared.
The Left has submitted an application calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a strictly guarded site for secret armaments research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality, with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for microelectronics and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives have established selenograds contacts with Riedberg as a science location in Frankfurt - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, and planning educator Edwin Schwarz signed for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises from the natural sciences investigation focus will be travelling to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be enabled to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the headquarters of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssiyskaya Elektronika.
The Commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned town" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "gransely") received its name from the wooded hilly landscape, in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake block
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the advocates of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than the depth deposit of a station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into hopeless construction chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born from the spirit of the 1980s.
Terminal stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were considered traffic fossils of the 19th century. The century, which looked like brake blocks of modern rail traffic, since it once took an enormous amount of time to clamp locomotives from behind to the front.
Enter, keep in, keep going - this is how it should go.
And that is why the terminal stations were to disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, which is located halfway along the trans-European rail highway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being addressed, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost priceless to implement the low-by-depth in the Hessian and Bavarian city.
However, terminal stations no longer have an input and exit problem since there are modern turn trains with traction vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 together with the new ICE construction route to Ulm is now being tackled.
State and local politicians have achieved it.
The railway is part of it, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure individual project is carried by the taxpayers' republic, not the state corporation.
The project can still be justified to some extent on town planning.
New urban space is created, which - believing the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The through station and the route expansion are intended for passenger services, to which - typically the 80s - one attributed huge growth.
At that time, there was not yet the competition of low-cost airlines.
Modern transport policy, however, must first be about strengthening freight transport, since transport by rail is considerably more environmentally friendly than by truck by road.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
Even more seriously, S21 also affects many other railway projects.
A good six billion euros are to be pudded in Swabia.
That is the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade money will be lacking at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty larger projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometre-long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built on the route at a slow motion.
It is urgent to press the tube correctly here.
But S21 will act as a brake block.
The Rhine Valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government considers airport judgment
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will be in court against the verdict of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) for a night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling examine legally, said Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP).
On these days, the VGH in Kassel had justified in writing that the country had to reschedule the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned north-west runway in Frankfurt Airport.
The admission of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o'clock, as provided for by the state government, is not compatible with the legally required protection of the population from aircraft noise at night.
The coalition must be held until 4. January decide whether to go against the verdict in appeal.
The opposition criticised this delay and invaded the government's representatives of the fact that they would refrain from revising the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD parliamentary group leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and the FDP to return to their promises made before the election for a ban on a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be regarded as a "wrongness".
It is damn hard to keep your word, Green head Tarek Al-Wazir said in allusion to the FDP election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "legal twisting and trickery".
An exact legal examination needs its time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a legally secure disclosure, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition represents, his faction says about the night flight ban were never.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden US banks are cutting off their state-owned fetters.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp in the amount of 45 billion dollars (a good 30 billion euros) in one fell swath.
According to a report by the US channel CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to refund state aid.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with the acceptance of the money – such as the limit on payment of managers and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had gained a good 19 billion dollars of fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum took them out of her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by sales of the division.
Bank head Kenneth Lewis expressly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: the money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had moved to the peak of the financial crisis with the takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market for exemption from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the US bank could announce a 20 billion dollar increase in its capital, CNBC reported on citing districts.
A Citigroup spokesman did not want to speak out.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
Then everything went faster than expected.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the station can present a successor.
Last night the panel wanted to vote on the personnel.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the station - officially so as not to anticipate the procedure.
However, this proposal should not be possible at the same time as not to damage the ZDF director Markus Schächter should not be able to get through this proposal to the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the time of writing.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed on the Board of Directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's renunciation was a severe defeat for arbitrator, but an expected one.
The Union majority on the management board had already signalled weeks before the election that Brender does not want to confirm in office.
The resistance was organised against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, ZDF's news broadcasts had lost ratings, he refused another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on ZDF was scourged.
Most recently, even 35 constitutional lawyers had interfered in the debate, which assessed Koch's actions as unconstitutional.
It has nothing to do.
To person
Peter Frey was born on 4. August 1957 was born in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "heute-journal".
Subsequent stops: 1988 to 1990 personal adviser to the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional complaint after Brender's election, which was voted Journalist of the Year by the industry journal Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's counterpart on the board of directors, Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that personnel proposals by the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an excerpt from party politicians from the supervisory bodies of ZDF.
Brender's probable successor Peter Frey had recommended itself to the board with a clever move - by he strongly criticising the committee for it immediately after the Brenderwahl.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate both arbitrator without loss of face for the post of editor-in-chief and elect the board of directors without being suspected of holding a party party to office.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is already attributed to the left-wing liberal.
Studies are decelerated
Partial success for the students: After a year of the educational strike, the Ministers of Education finally instructed the countries on Thursday: at a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor's and Master's degrees.
In the future, students should be able to cope with their studies.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination loads: Basically, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be examined and "a realistic and reasonable degree" is to be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination achievements between universities inside and outside Germany.
The federal states committed themselves to making common structural specifications for Bachelor's and Master's degree programmes more flexible.
Furthermore, there should be no deviating country regulations.
Less tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, the Minister of Culture and the University officials have written the winged word of better study in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in some cases: "Every module usually concludes with only one examination," says a 30-page paper, which is to partially reorganise the admission of courses of study.
With the "significant reduction in the examination burden," explained the accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "malris development should be stopped, which significantly affected the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" will be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content is "strictly to check to the way" whether "unnecessary requirements of the students in choosing the
Events" would be avoided.
The students had "demand to obtain scope, which enable and promote initiative."
The rules are to be applied when admission to new ones, but also when examining existing courses of study.
These have to be "replenal" every five years – which means that it will take until 2015 until all courses of study have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies nationwide, which are subject to the Accreditation Council established by the countries, are responsible for this.
In October, the Ministers of Education called on the countries "with emphasis" to influence the agencies so that the material fullness is not too great and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
Rhineland-Palatinate is the only country to say additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The universities are primarily intended to set up tutor programmes and strengthen student advisory services as well as examination and international offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act into parliament.
After this, only a single examination should be required for the completion of a study model.
The aim is to become more flexible, and the recognition of proof of performance at other universities is to be ensured and access to the master's degree is to be made easier.
By the end of next year, all courses of study in the country are to be checked for their study.
The government and the opposition had once again argued on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The federal executive board of the Juso university groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer be held "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students as affected should now also "a say a word".
The future academics were provided with support from the President of the German Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experience," said on Thursday at a meeting with the Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform paper.
The Bonn decisions did not go far enough to the trade union Education and Science (GEW): it demands a legal claim that allows every graduate to access a further master's degree programme with a bachelor's degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that sufficient Master's programmes with the best possible study conditions will be available tomorrow for today's generation of Bachelor's students, says GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the Ministers of Education of Culture did not express themselves about freer access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
The initial line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner is the initial line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a disciple scraps of language, who has gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language area.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romanian, had worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publishing house before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been director of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he caused a considerable extra-literary sensation during a conference in Munich, which was about "German Literature in Romania in the mirror and the mirroring of their Securitate files".
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed Söllner read a statement in which he told Romanian German writers, including a member. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, who had helped his work as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner received the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts had started creeping, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "someone who has not ended up enough against attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller and its unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of Romanian authors are shaken by a case that makes the abysses and the baseness of a political system that is based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is not only perpetrator, but also victim, as far as one can say to date according to the previous state of knowledge.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter said, after the confession of Söllner, the literary scholar Michael Markel said and referred to the effectiveness of the IM Walter.
He had "cut him out" of him in all the divisive points at that time, says Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this comment.
Söllner's declaration was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, but the commitment of an earlier dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Germany was a cosy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July in the time after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
The those affected, one may assume, will be speculated and in some cases probably also knew which commercial name was hidden behind the code name Sorin, Voicu and also Walter.
In contrast to the now very procedural viewing of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of Securitate monitoring is still very diffuse.
A systematic explanation has been undertone and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Processing of Securitate (CNSAS) appropriate to the Birthler authorities was not founded until 1999, but the publication of the files has been rather sluggish since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that regulates the management of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large was documented by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar expressed himself derogatoryly about the award winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power thought to be able to express itself here blatantly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Sölln, as is so often the case of silent guilt, are inevitable issues.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The prudent reaction of the listeners to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know to know than by the apportionment of blame and shame.
It is more than a footnote on the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It looked as if a recently dressed sales agent was coming from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the supplier, rose to a quarter of an hour after midnight in a called C-Class. 
The man with the striking baldness was chauffeured because of the city still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not involved, and the 55-year-old was just as unlike luck.
We had been a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or really go.
In the words of the Swiss who had only been committed to three days earlier: "We have reached the eighth finale," namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we can't be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally strong fight against relegation."
The "much more important task" is imminent on Sunday.
Then it is important to repeat the king class performance in the league everyday life in Mainz.
And to stop the weaknesses that were quite renewed after the fast three gates by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The round of 16 of the Champions League (first editions 16/17. + 23./24 February/ secondaries 9/10. + 16./17. March) will be held on the 18th December in Nyon.
The joy of the brilliant death of the Babbel successor remained so restrained.
Not only with the supposed salary charmer who had conveyed the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time trust, commitment and joy of playing.
I approached the players and told them to remember their strengths, and urged them to be more courageous, told Seelenklempner Gross the so simple-ringing recipe for success, but had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He sparked a certain magic, admitted Babbel proponent Jens Lehmann, "if there is a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of injury pause, immediately became the best player in the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the noted "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working methods of the new superior: "He is a man who goes through and demands discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
There had obviously been lacking under Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet about the mountain, warns sports officer Horst Heldt
However, VfB Stuttgart needs above all consistency.
Like a great one, players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a substitute weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before Khedira gave an immemorial four days later in Leverkusen at the 0:4 the evil awakening.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal was reached, the other was still a long way off.
We are not yet above the mountain.
That's the hero on his 40th century. The birthday even after the first home victory in three months had not felt like it was due to the events of the weekend, which were breaking up in the form of a television interview by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was broadcast immediately before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, Heldt countered Lehmann's harsh criticism.
He had accused the board of weak leadership and had decided to change coaches on pressure of publishing fans.
Lehmann also described the fact that his free day had been cancelled after games was regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and resentment.
Lehmann's statements are "shaped by pure selfishness," Heldt hadted back and announced consequences for the closing man.
They will probably no longer become friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the replaced team of trainers, the playful and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large part in the success," said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
World Cup Fight in Heavyweight
Hitzig's duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world champion in the heavyweight.
The 38-year-old champion after version of the WBC edition of the association defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously on the night of Saturday in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defence after its comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian has previously been world champions of the WBO and WBC associations twice.
Unfortunately, it did not work with the knockout, which everyone expected.
Klitschko increased his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, and he had to admit defeat twice due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to Fight the first defeat.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02 metre Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight primarily with his left-wing leadership hand.
The eleven centimetres smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the Duel, repeatedly withdrew from the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not bring his dangerous rights decisively into the finish.
All in all, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely met the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some fuss before the battle in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as a "ugly zombie" who "can't really do".
While weighing, the champion then allowed himself to provoke on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose, "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko remained in his fourth fight after his comeback on 11. October 2008 victorious.
After almost four years of break, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and brought back his "his" WBC belt, which he had previously sold without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and Chris Arreola from the USA in September.
I only got a blow in this fight and I am physically very good in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Wladimir is world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
The belt of the WBA, however, is wearing the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone Nikolai Walujew, which were 2.13 metres in November.
Haye had previously cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko planned for September in the summer.
It is said that its promotional company is already planning to fight Klitschko at London's Wembley Stadium.
Case of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green Group leader Jürgen Trittin has described Defence Minister Guttenberg as a liar for false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the left demand clarification from the chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air raid by Kunduz, the opposition has under a conscious deception of Defense Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU).
The minister had said "knowingly the untruth" for the fatal bombardment of two tanker load trains in September, said Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme "Tagesschau".
This is called common: He lied.
The order to kill was granted in defiance of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report that NATO had read, which Mr Guttenberg read, said Trittin.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders.
According to NATO report, up to 142 people were killed or injured in the US air raid, which was requested by the German Kunduz commander Oberst Klein.
On Saturday, the Green, SPD and the Left called on Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to express their views immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Mrs Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the Federal Government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, Jürgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate Künast demanded.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence the Bundeswehr's specific operations in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the presentation of the Ministry about the background of the dismissal of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to information from SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have informed correctly and completely about the background of the tank truck stop.
It was officially said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and denied the minister sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it was said that they even referred the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a campaigner report.
In the meantime, Wichert is said to have asked for clarification of the facts in a letter, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to be constituted next Wednesday.
Dream worlds
Some see pictures in awake state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred not only in the mental sick and in the drug rush.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie in our dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can indulge in the wildest ideas and fantasy structures without remoteness.
However, those who experience dreamlike states in the being awake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, is usually considered crazy or drug-addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a nerd.
However, such images and voices are not only created in mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that enable us to design houses, paint images or write novels sometimes ensure that the boundaries between dream, madness and reality become blurred.
Dreamlike changed states of awareness can occur in the most varied forms, at best we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Even if the triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the new-age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messenger substances of the brain - especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is dissolved.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very frequently during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in an alert state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated a "great similarity of misery with dream states" in 1861," for Sigmund Freud was the dream very "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, madness, sense deceptions of such."
It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic character.
His body is two-dimensional and bright.
Gravity has no power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted grimaces, teeth-sucking.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar from walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs up on a loudspeaker and lies down the noose around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is coming loose.
This should be a lesson for you, shout the voices in drum skin-innated choir, "Go to the clinic and let yourself heal!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one was 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoatactic paranoid psychosis, besides, he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication, against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, and he has been married for three years.
In the psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in a lifetime, and psychiatric clinics she is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, those affected can usually no longer distinguish between the inside and outside world, they find themselves in an overexcited state that can lead to hallucinations, megalomania, relationships or persecution.
Listening to votes is particularly common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The person is no longer able to separate important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, the psychosis opens the locks to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-fed, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Senior Physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is located in the centre of the events, everything has a direction of meaning.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, he becomes overwhelmed by the events, similar to the dream, and cannot actively shape it.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are usually not able to compare reality, the illusions are cruel reality, waking up excluded.
Having experienced a hallucination once in life
Unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality, which is perceived in psychosis, basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real framework.
Why exactly our brain proposes capriolen, researchers are still puzzleing.
In every human being, states of emergency can lead to their reality briefly losing the reality reference, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there are minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fuchs explains.
But there remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neural system comes about, which is also not manifested at first for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis, as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is running hot
The crazy is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which ones, says the Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether illusions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of position.
Box has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceptional phenomena for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of an astonishing number of other illnesses.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often also include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's disease and dancer brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates.
Hallucinations, so boxes, are composed of memories that are normally retained.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain is running hot or when stimulation is missing.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also irritation, stress, lovesickness or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to one third of those surveyed said they had experienced hallucination at least once in a lifetime.
In the summer of 2005 Sarah K. She lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the Gymnasium there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were not the pictures and voices.
During the break it may happen that a shallow boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They consider the shy girl to be a spy daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
It can even feel its presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night the apparitions are usually scary
Often the mirage images are also a load.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the teaching material, because the teacher is presenting a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations for all others audibly and visibly on the table.
At night, the apparitions are usually scary.
When she waits for sleep in her dark room, which is far too rare and much too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or dreams, whether the pictures she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on the arms and legs, arise in front of her open or closed eyes.
Let me alone, crying at the figures.
Parents and friends do not tell them anything about them, they would think they are crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed her Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Since she contacted the psychologist's box on the internet, she knows full well that she is not crazy.
Madness is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from severance deprivation, he most likely has hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then understaffed and takes care of its conversation.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Dad since she could think was not her physical father.
Since the same brain areas of the brain that also process real impressions and sounds in visual and acoustic hallucinations, it is difficult for those affected like Sarah K. to distinguish illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, the reality is reflected there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, so they seem so real."
Even nocturnal dream pictures regard boxes as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
In contrast to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their illusions as unreal.
Box therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Border state between dream and hallucination
In our too very mind-centered world, imaginary experience is unfortunately usually pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and chief physician at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also holds positive, creative - delusion is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has explored the so-called oneiroideual form of experience, a special form of dreamlike changed waking consciousness.
Oneiroide is highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even afterwards.
The oneiroide state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and loss of world, for example by continuing, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since the coping with a situation is not possible in reality, there is a change of world, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intensive form of making senses and meaning in a situation that is inherently unbearable, which enables us people to not perish in a nothing of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue operation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation followed by a heart transplant, while his body in the Intensive Care Unit is sentenced to lessness.
Claussen immerses himself in a self-created world, visits strange times and places: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
In the early Middle Ages, he lives under nobles who make intoxicants from blood.
If a Greek is kidnapped on a motorcycle in his home country, surf with its hospital bed in the fir snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely up to the imagined events, everything is real, even later in the memory.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in secondary details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience bursts the horizon of our other lifeworldly experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
In the end, oneiroid, psychosis, hallucinations and drug frenzy show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist caste sums up, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children should take over the publishing house at 27 years
The new publishing house manager Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to give his company into the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company should continue to be owned by 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to join the company, the 69-year-old said SPIEGEL.
We have regulated the details of this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company only arises afterwards.
The question of whether they are able to do so.
You cannot put your children to 7500 employees if they are not sufficiently capable.
This will also kill the children and the company.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had withdrawn from the chairmanship of the board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Burda since 1999.
He was initially responsible for technology.
Later, the responsibility for the company's assets came with the Treasury and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer, the company also joined direct marketing, foreign marketing, printing and finances.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who was 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The name of Kallen also serves to "change 10, 15 years," says Burda.
The holding should continue to be 100% of the family, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of chic cance and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from their demise: "This always concerned families who were infected by a sham that have completely speculated and thought that they could thus become a very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had "never dreams of power" says Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country as it was Springer, and I don't want to play along with 'Time' in the world league, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you could ask for in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you .
At least that's what El Corte Inglés has planned, who recently opened a retail store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything revolves around body care.
In the spa area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find respected companies such as Hedonai, which provide a depilatory with laser; SpaxiÃ n, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
There is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different teas.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to get your own "beauty party" with eight friends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities offered by SpaxiÃ3n.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for the hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating areas.
The gym also has these types of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thereby offer them completely personal training.
You start a training session with entering a personal password on a touch screen, which is located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to perform your workouts correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warming up and stretching exercises) are completely sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if you want to drop by the hairdressing salon after you have trained your body, the Luis & Tachi company has a space where treatments are offered for regaining hair, shine and health for your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this spa area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10.00 in the morning until 10 pm 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and so it is again a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that needs to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated neckline. You can only advise against it.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, created the "LIVE office".
This is a project to develop and promote electric cars in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility through management, coordination, subsidies, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is currently being developed to promote the electric car and opinions and measures to combine the areas involved.
This is an attempt to drive forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the launch of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also taking part in this project.
These are the three cities chosen by the government in the MOVELE project to speed up the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement aims to promote the activities of research and technological development in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among others, such activities, which are connected with energy and in particular with their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative in which Endesa is participating in the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardisation groups throughout Europe and has a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of peace" for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, predicts "a horizon of rest" to the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter.
At the presentation of the 2009 economic report by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures taken by the government to support the automotive sector in support of the government year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and the closing of some of our main production works today," said the president of the government.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the automobile manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry in the future, we can see a quiet horizon for the connection of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the competitiveness plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), has provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The head of government said that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's actions to boost demand, reference to the 2000E Plan, which are used in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the Automobile Manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows exhaust gases for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market by 6% on average, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.

Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally compatible sports
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is consistent with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the engine's automatic stop and start-up system for the Mazda3 model, named i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 stands out for its good notes in the overall picture.
The finishing, the design of the vehicle, the comfort, its street behaviour, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" at the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, it can be seen that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
Furthermore, watching the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is with a variety of buttons and switches in the spectacular colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us partly of the style of the Honda Civic.
It can therefore be easily said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, are based on the sobriety of the German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to exceed.
More than ever, the passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers the corresponding comfort, so that four adults can easily drive by car.
To all this comes a large-scale and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearshift.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its fineness, its quiet noise, its performances and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in gear shifting and its low consumption, even if Mazda in particular the diesel models are the best-selling ones.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model, which is selected for the test drive, is a special feature, since it has a significantly larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The head-track change (RVM) assistant stands out from the series equipment, which abolishes the blind spot, but also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirrors, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, an independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth as well as the chromium-inch rims.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough of equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: among other elements, the binixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not cover many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the test-ridden model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest day in the best driving fun every day.
A premiere with great glamour
L. A. rolls out the red Tepppich of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine" the stars shone more than ever, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy.
Our "pee", as elegant as always, chose a dark "Lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is very limited, a device that allows you to read only your e-mails without a way to see certain attachments or surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose the magazine Time as one of the products of the year.
It is rather unlikely to see it on the street, but the idea itself is still of interest to young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success with it, the company has launched two new devices on the market: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifelong free service for data, unlike Peek, where you have to pay a price six times higher.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the telephone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data in order to be able to read your emails once you have crossed the country border or if you are desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a connection with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the small print.
The European Commission's repeated criticism of affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe has almost always ignored.
Outside your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, although it does not have a wifi/WLAN) can offer this type of tariffs means that telephone providers need to rethink slowly but surely and start taking different ways of using their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
Without vetrag and without hook.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, namely when buying, and not month by month.
And that's exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a possibility of buying with lifelong Internet access as Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I believe that it would be a more suitable model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favourite colour of the American First Lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same colour again to accompany him at his, without a doubt, the second most important moment in his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: a clean that it was almost the same color - a shiny green yellow, the clothing consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and wore them somewhat large-shaped or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it seemed that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than just one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
When she was introduced, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo a patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a welcome model, but gold-coloured.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was stuck up as a hair wreath on this occasion, on the previous one she was wearing her hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among the younger women who want children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fruitability and Careers of Women in Spain" conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labour market limited due to their maternity.
The study reveals that there are great differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not, and if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other activity outside the house, work only half-day or do not have a fixed employment contract, will rather have mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women shift the establishment of a family and motherhood with a fixed job, especially in the public sphere, and therefore have fewer children.
"The women in the age group between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed job get their first child only 3.7 years after the merger, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with fixed employment who have needed longer to achieve this and who have realized their merger and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a great influence on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar with regard to conception," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the age at the time of marriage and the first child, the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they have only the secondary school leaving certificate or a higher education, the average of 25.1 or 32,1 each became a mother for the first time.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women are already getting married before their first permanent conclusion and get their first child, the women with a middle or high school leaving qualification make it exactly the other way around and first look for a permanent position and then get their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to its envy list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year onwards, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading actress from "Joyeux Noel", one of the most elegant actresses of an international level, will become another famous flagship such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last ones were allowed to join this exclusive club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
The cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors for the men: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (actor colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today - met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On this occasion they all appeared.
The ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model this year.
The Poker Game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker the Aces" (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) to the three x-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and fearless genre (short-biography, life and work), but seeks a fairness to the luminous heart of the creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent does not save on horrors or illuminations.
What else that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and reading again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy as opposed to the ominous fate, morality without guilt and the innocence without any God".
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between impotence and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our man was drawn into her captivity by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in whose flesh the emotions were united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in heaven coming to detour of perish."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. This is one of the 8000 peaks in worldwide literature, you have to climb up the north face, on the wall, where the best mountaineers are always trying again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny owl.
He sometimes said about himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and other times he said that he was the son of a black and a crocodile.
Both dreams showed a certain size."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took on the insane scream, which was screamed down from a bridge from Munich, so that his echo was released from the night of the 20th century. century echoed in its literary way. He made this on a journey on which he fled from himself and begged the posterity with a speech full of violence to the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my dear god, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I could finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these verses of Spencer are engraved: ' Sleep after the effort,/after the thunderstorm of the port,/ the calm after the war,/ after a hefty life you find pleasure at death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she always had her depression with her.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on them between the azales or singing the birds in Greek.
Not a single other case is known, where the man had so much patience and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness."
About P'o Baroja: "What else did MartÃ3n-Santos do than to try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he did not bring Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except to destroy the glory of that man, so that he can put himself on this pedestal?"
Fig aggression
My 70-year-old mother went through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 ran next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed mixture that we took out the shelter and which weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue, they killed him two kicks.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, since it is incomprehensible to us, where there should be fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
In addition, there was the suffocation attack, which a woman who went for a comfortable walk, when she wanted to rebuke these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if a mad man attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an older man, or even with everyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet district at five in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog has howled all day long.
Of course, we have reported a police station in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts as to whether this will happen at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we only want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our indignation about what happened has led us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be done in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We do not know where good education and respect for animals and persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies have now known.
This initiative wants to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "which includes more than just the design and production of products that are becoming increasingly safe with each day" and further confirmed that they are also helping to achieve this goal one step closer to each day with other actions.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters at over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "constant concern" of the company, and especially for the reason that it, as a manufacturer of tyres, is always committed to two-wheeled vehicles, which must be the development of ever safer products for one of its main goals.
The sale of small trucks is rising somewhat again
After almost two years, the car market for vans finally begins to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9.425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase after 22 consecutive months, with steady decline, as shown by the manufacturers' association Anfac and the Ganvam car dealer association.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for the comparison of November 2008 are, which was a particularly bad sales year with a decrease of 60% in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this number includes all vehicles that make up the vanity market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vanes, small vans and lighter small cars/chassis.
Furthermore, the same thunderstorm clouds in the sky are still affecting demand the most, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the large part of the sales goes to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with third financing.
For example, one has to include other factors on these restrictions, which are the result of the turned-up money tap of the credit institutions, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the persistence of the poor economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, the financial support in buying a plan 2000E helped less.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also self-employed and small businesses have a right to buy if they want to buy a van of up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emissions that must not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded us that it is absolutely necessary by the state to pay special attention to these small coasters and, of course, to the industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Car Dealer Association predicts a similar year for 2010 to the one that is just past, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the ABS anti-lock braking system and as is now happening with the ESP stability control, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, and a waiting period for the remaining vehicles was set by the end of February 2011.
The decision taken by the European Union is aimed at improving the protection of pavers, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end collisions due to their way of working.
The task of the emergency brake assist is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the brake strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident did not even come to step on the brake pedal before the collision, and half of them had not slowed down with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, intervenes with maximum force in the braking system and thus reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents every year could be prevented if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that one in four companies could be prevented by personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
The vehicle is then equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assist exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes, in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors shifts the plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on 8, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer wrote that he needs more time to bring the rescue plan for Opel to the final.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the affected page gives its consent to each individual point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason it may be that the final document, which will first be submitted to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will postpone itself until the beginning of 2010.
GM will be assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy up Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skype racing car, which has backing from the Russian group Converg, is becoming increasingly popular.
If none of these buyers reach an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to include Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos easier, which would now weigh only 1,275 kilos.
To do something like this, they first dispensed with the automatic hinged roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with manual drive, so that alone saves 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminium doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15; by removing the air conditioning system again 13;five saving again.
Then the missing kilo had reached the missing kilo by renouncing the CDR-30 audio system again and by replacing the door handles with material handles.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out by a vehicle with 6-speed hand transmission, mainly on the smaller land roads of California, on mountain tracks that were really very winding.
At its driving behaviour it is possible to give it only a note perfectly.
However, the reduction of his weight has by no means meant that he would no longer be so safe on the street.
The opposite is the case: for a long time we have not done such a small and light model, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low gear in the required time, until we give him the commands to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything you tell him. The car does everything we indicate to him with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to his steering, which is just as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all flavours
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is extremely successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is inconceivably brutal, whether out of standing or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the land road, on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder, was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire route; although we found ice at dawn and roll split on some of these curves at dawn and roll split.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable ride fun, as is usually rare, and there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster S.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Coco Cocoon cosmetic line and an occasional starch at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck rigidity as her pockets from Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
Despite the many unusual players in the Dusko Ivanovic team, the Caja Laboral celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and comes to first place within his group after the grand performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight triple (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant attacks by Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, even if they wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits out of the perimeter with 16 rated triple carried a meaningfully to their final victory.
The game started with the lead of the blue-red, who sat down to the top of the advertisement board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria were already out of the perimeter, one could already guess that they had come to the pitch with well-heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic, who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly otherwise, only that the team from lava opted for an inside game from Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was welcomed on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already began to emphasize himself as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of splinters have already guessed that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage of the clear advantage during the break, the game was far from being decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their pitch, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of ElÃas" they came back into play.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the "yellow" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, hurt, but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air again and with one of them suddenly came the pistol from Mirza Teletovic, who said with three almost consecutive triple and with the support of English and Ribas, that the display board was again shown a smoothing distance of (54-67) at the end of the third quarter.
The Alavesens were exposed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson did not resign the best of their team and tried to give their team back by three points from the line from (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although splinters were put off the place because of fouls, Ivanovic did not give up, defended themselves well and even though the Israelis caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game had already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from facing up
Unicaja said to Olympiacos in Greece and had to cede the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that was marked in a game characterized by the failures by the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the interior play, which made the Greeks easier to win.
The Malaga crew was neither afraid of the mood in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their presented game in the first quarter, the Andalusians were allowed to begin to dream. An aggressive error and three consecutive triple, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, dazzled the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th century. Minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the existence Unicaja, even though the local team made it with an interior game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis that the display board in the 13th century. Minute 22-20 in her favor indicated, the minute in which there was almost a fight between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team finally started to warm up and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-induced mistakes of Carlos Jiménez were clear marks on Unicaja.
Among their players in the inner field and the Lithuanian leader Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their advantage in the 19th century. Minute at 44-32.
A hunting was impossible
The third playing quarter was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which, despite its 19 losses, showed superior and even managed to make the difference between the game in Malaga and 66-48 in the 27th game. Minute to balance what in turn wavered the leadership within the group.
Unicaja tried to overwhelm the many attacks and the departure of Scots Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31. Minute thanks to the lead and triple of Cook and the use of Lewis again some hope for 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible, because as soon as it attacked and showed its superiority with centimeters inside the basket area, it was not to be broken.
The Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic made it in the 37th. Minute, to let the basket difference rise to 81-62 and Unicaja had to admit defeat and had to cede the leadership toOlympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile in Facebook?
Facebook users can now experience their salary thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most advertisements of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain, which they should earn on the basis of their profile.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form in Facebook that can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish employee feels "badly paid on average," explains Albert Ribera, who is responsible for the Trovit product, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the lowest-paid according to the data Trovit, which Trovit has through its search engines in Britain and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31.059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros that a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of 34,247 euros in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 euros in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid work in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros annually net; followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most frequently looked up places on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day spots and social workers.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President, who has been removed from office, must be held by the diplomatic mission at the latest on 27. Leave on January 2010 if its mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the commercial delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to the TV channel TV Globo that "Mel" wei, that he was previously held the message in which he had since the 21st of the day. September had found asylum, must have left.
"He is provoked that he is on the 27th. January must go, because his mandate expires on this day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The station also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My position is to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the elections on the 29th November (where Porfirio Lobo emerged victorious) Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to gain refuge in Brazil.
This failed, however, because Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the "de facto" government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when the inflation of assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is in no way surprising, since this is their natural state, in an environment in which the brokers make decisions about a future that is inherently uncertain.
The seizure used to stabilise the markets was to pay off the debt by purchasing assets directly and to leave indirectly the liquidity free of liquidity at interest rates that are moving around zero so that the banks buy assets to bill in this way.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without questioning their heterodox policies on liquidity, are beginning to dig some sand into the gear, as the BCE näc is already presenting it with its annual auction, which is taking place next week.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain the economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are currently witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volatilities of the stock markets and the differences in the corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalise the private risks and the national debt is increasing again.
Quality is now being put back on, and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the eurozone countries in Germany.
Spain has hardly been affected by this episode of instability so far, but then came Standard & Poor's and threatened to come up with a new revision down regarding the evaluation of Spain.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silencing the defenders of moral risk, who once again had tried to create awareness among those responsible for global economic policies, for what had caused them, because they had slowed the devastating effects to which the restriction of credits led to the loss of jobs when they had to decide a new day to the thanks.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the emirs to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has been foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals the national debt, elections and a new government that pulls in the same way.
In Italy, Prodi did it to Berlusconi and SÃ3crates in Portugal after Durao Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from non-fulfilment of its foreign payments at the beginning of the year, and thus allowing a euro member country to fail to meet its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to oblige its citizens in the need of taking action against the need for omitted measures to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, as expected, we are facing an episode of normalisation of risk premiums, after some debauchery on too large amounts, it would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, it is not necessary to worry as long as the differences in public debt are increased at the same speed as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if the European differences decrease and the Spanish continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the earlier indicators force a majority of market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for the recovery and to correct their scenario upwards for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which come back with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long lifespan despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although there is currently the trend of "beek when driving".

The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before the subcommittee of the Parliament yesterday, where the strategy for the energy supply of Spain will be debated over the next two decades.
After his appearance, followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some bullet points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the Chairman of Iberdrola, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros and another 60 billion from this date until 2030 by 2020, under the prerequisite that the current nuclear power plants will remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investments required would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the question will change and performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for collecting carbon dioxide and, of course, particularly on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, which is naturally required by other "support energies", under the requirements.
Galán, who believes that the draft proposed for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say something against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all the policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "they are clearly sitting in the long term, despite some" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola referred to.
Whether it is, Galán believes that the decisions on investments, even if these are long-term, should be taken, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created in order to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's subsidiary for services at airports on ground, the Swiss Swiss port, is the preferred partner of the Irish company Aer Lingus for luggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have been announced yet, is scheduled for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance is planning to invest 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the centre will be to investigate energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting to grant its first highway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The construction involved is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (approximately 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are the competitors.
A 5 kilometre long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and motorway operator.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had decided to work on public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan set up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll office management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia consisting mainly of European construction companies competing in the last phase.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure and the French Bouygues construction group, is against the Acciona team.
The third and last consortium, which is shortlisted, is LBRJV, formed by the capital of the Australian Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises huge construction work and privatisations, but has a hurdle that needs to be overcome, since you only get access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that the mentioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, have followed, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish building giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its 30% stake in Hochtief, owner of the aforementioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona is committed to this geographical area of utmost importance to the industry, where it is already well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it has already had its largest windmill park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide's desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the branches of construction and infrastructure.
The underground toll route, which will be promoted by the Brisbane Infrastructure Office and will become a member of Northern Link, is intended to connect the western highway in Toowong with the Kelvin Grove bypass in Kelvin Grove (see map) for a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest way to reduce the streets of Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll route is already to open up to traffic in recent months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex venting system.
The Queensland government is investing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) in its financing.
Brisbane is already a big business for Hochtief.
Australia repeatedly awards considerable contracts to Hochtief, which yesterday signed a contract with the government of 154 million.
The company ACS will use its local subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million in this respect.
In the UK, Manchester, it also competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools for 25 years.
The initial investment is 75 million euros.
FCC receives order for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, FCC has earned the construction of a tunnel over a 2.1 kilometre long for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros.
The company received this contract just a few days after it had been awarded the contract for the construction work to expand the Bosruck (Austria) tunnel over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnelling.
The start of the construction work is scheduled for early 2010 and its implementation will take over 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives Renfe commercial budget
Renfe has the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sra. Rushmore attributed to a sum of approximately three million euros per year, the railway company said.
This agreement also has the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies presenting this competition, which was presented by Renfe, 4 of which came into the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising in the last three years.
From now on Sra. Rushmore is tasked with the design and production of the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom because of braking the competition.
The French Competition Regulatory Authority has imposed a fine of 63 million euros on 63 million euros for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean areas belonging to the country.
According to the authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landlines and mobile cards by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and state-owned enterprises has accumulated more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The sentence imposed yesterday has even been increased, since the authority that monitors competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trade
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet to increase revenue from transactions that do not originate from the telephone connection.

The game in the Champions League has earned Madrid and Bara 476.4 million since the beginning.
The Champions League has developed into a source of income for the FuÃoball clubs since its creation in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since then raised 476.4 million, which brings them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the Champions League of the UEFA Champions not only brings glory. It is also one of the main sources of taking the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) who have been taking part in this event since it was founded in the 1992-1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona has benefited from this distribution.
The weiÃ3e club is in Europe's third place, which has earned the most money from its participation and who, in addition to AC Milan, the only one who has won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is in fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams, which also earned the most money through their participation in the past Champoins League.
And this even though they lost to Bara.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to take money by the champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, unlike four are Italy, three at England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated funds granting process that UEFA uses.
In this financial year, the organization, which Michel Platini chairs, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides for 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) has been given 2.1 million.
In addition, those who were competing for participation were given 3.8 million by their blosty attendance, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winnings (€800,000) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the round of 16 will each receive three million; the four who have reached the quarter-finals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four will receive 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, unlike the second, who receives 5.2 million.
For example, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
With his victory at the European Super Cup in August, Bara earned 2.5 million.
However, there are also variable payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is allocated proportional to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's master receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa Group has allowed details to be swept through the offer of shares, with which it wants to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (ope) due to the number of shares.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, which are paid out for ten years and at an interest rate of 1% annually due to this postponement.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa rates the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Group of Jeréz gives shareholders a notice period of 15 days to provide their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it has not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had been in contact with the authority.
At a closing, the deposit would be 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain on the verge of possible purchases and the court quarrels of his ex-managers, the JesÃos and Jaime Salazar brothers announced the appointment of Maria Luisa Jordá as head of the internal audit.
A decision with which she becomes the first woman to hold a high stake at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free of polemics because the company is involved in a court battle on suspicion of diversion of more than 230 million of Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will postpone further capital over the next few months.
In view of the Salazar's loans, the ex-consultants Ildefonso Ortega and ngel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday, confirming that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their destiny.
CNMV approves the public tender submitted by the investment company Mer by Paternina
The National Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina presented by the investment company Mer on 9 October. October.
The supervisory authority declared that it approved this tender after it has been proven that the conditions are complied with the final laws and thus the content of the explanatory journal, after the amendments of the past 2. December, can be considered as "sufficient".
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares by Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 6.95% of the company's capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,686 in the shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares had been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the tender was concluded and whose price was set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally binding laws.
New programs for the evaluation of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents not only earn the car workshops
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed into the workshops, where an expert has to assess the damage and costs for the repair.
Not a single accident is the same and the calculation of costs for the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
In contrast, with the support of the latest computer tooling, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the experts use this type of systems.
The service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repair collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to then process them and offer them to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reports are prepared with their products.
The other two companies that compete with the tool market for review and drafting a report are GtMots and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Audatex Sales Manager, each of them is collaborated with 63 manufacturers and importers, with each of them providing the information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be processed becomes ever greater, to the point that even more versions, variants and motorisations have been brought to the market in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes onto the market, the work begins for companies.
It is a tedious task, because every single of the thousand parts of the vehicle has to be entered catalytic and its price.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. Audatex currently has complete information with 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the vehicle fleet moving on the route, it is over 99%.
In order to carry out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters are located in Alcobendas, Madrid.
More than a hundred technicians (usually mechanical experts) work there simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they absorb 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use them in different ways and thereby offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, however, depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the filing or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star being AudaPlus, a standard solution for accidents for the experts.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
Auction the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint finish prices.
This tool is paid for for each expert opinion, i.e.
The most expensive it will be for customers who use it rarely, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
In contrast, every insurance company that produces thousands of expert opinions negotiates the prize with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly belt is solely based on the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist store, which can be used for vehicles that have been declared a total loss.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analysis or obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
One can investigate, for example, how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damages, breakdowns or Maintenance of vehicles was founded.
The GT Leader for Expert Reports is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased over the last three years at 20% per year, and in 2008 the turnover amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in Spain in 1979.
According to company sources, 62% of their business is made in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in the Americas. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total sales in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to 557 million dollars, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of EUR 19.1 million, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth 1 billion dollars on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded to a value of 2.4 billion dollars.
Since 2007, they have been on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the reference index Standard & Poor's.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group purchased a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicle and motorcycles.
This purchase meant paying 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value creation, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This evaluation and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry experts, such as insurance companies, experts, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The website nowadays has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
3,000 advertisements are managed every day and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the streets, but certain unfelled parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, however, may be allowed to be allowed again, even if they have been notified after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives an estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older experts, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database comprises 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and the required spare part is selected afterwards.
The user can include variables such as the price of work hours, surcharges or discounts, and then he can have the quote printed out and passed on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for reviewing such as AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the factory workshop does not involve an estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can pay without further use.
Audatex is currently working on being able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because you can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the picture around completely to view the inside.
