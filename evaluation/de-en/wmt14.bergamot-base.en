Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling and grammar
In courses on English literature, students will in future have to attend at least one play by Shakespeare, a novel of 19. Century, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The examination also includes "unseen texts" in order to encourage wider reading.
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015, students will have to take a stand-alone GCSE exam for language, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit body, will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures, including a new grading system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said that there is "a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence," stressing that the GCSEs would become "challenging, more ambitious and stricter."
Studies show that in English schools, less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours annually and students in Singapore receive 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable, it is said that the comprehensive math exam – combined with a greater emphasis on the subject in rankings – will probably encourage schools to set more hours.
The curriculum pays more attention to "problems from real life", including financial mathematics.
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to twice life on Friday.
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC.
The victim had later died as a result of the serious injuries.
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty earlier this week.
The act had sparked nationwide horror.
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town.
Doctors spent 14 hours fighting for the victim's survival, but in vain.
The sight of the young people was so appalling that the nurses and nurses needed psychological assistance.
Kana had admitted during the trial to having been with Booysen in a bar on the night of the crime.
He also confessed to beating and raping her, but he denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police had initially assumed several perpetrators, but released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was not enough.
The prosecutor’s office also stressed during the proceedings that she was convinced that Cana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost commonplace in South Africa: there are about 64 000 sexual violence complaints every year.
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany, but with 82 million people it has significantly more inhabitants than South Africa (50 million).
Police and women's associations in South Africa estimate the number of sexual violence, however, to be 10 to 25 times.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a lovable owl because he has set out to take part in a race in America with his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt is not to be dissuaded from his dream despite a heart defect.
With his savings, a few donations and a mortgage on his old workshop shed, he transfers by ship to Los Angeles.
After the movie there is coffee, tea and cake.
The exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in the breath.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was disrupted on Friday afternoon German time.
In a notice, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other eleven U.S. options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unhindered.
The latest incident continues a whole series of minor and major breakdowns at the exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday, the indices of the Nasdaq had not been calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport.
In August of this year, there had been two breakdowns in a week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent en mass faulty buy orders to the options markets because of technical problems.
As a result, the exchange operators needed almost a whole day to see through the orders and cancel them.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the U.S. came to a halt for several hours because of a computer breakdown on the Nasdaq exchange.
In addition, the IPO of Facebook caused a stir last year.
The Nasdaq systems had not been up to the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later noted, and sentenced the company to a record $10 million fine.
Intelligence revealer Edward Snowden is basically ready for a conversation with German authorities.
First, however, he wants to know his situation clarified.
This was made clear by the former NSA employee wanted by the US in an unaddressed letter, which the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
The letter, after a translation disseminated by Ströbele, has the following wording:
To the responsible
I have been asked to write to you regarding your mass surveillance investigation.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to be contracted or contracted. through a direct position as a technical expert at the National Security Agency (NSA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).
In the course of my employment in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of the law by my government, which led me to act out of moral duty.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I faced a serious and ongoing incitement that forced me to leave my family and homeland.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum, which the Russian Federation grants me in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political action, both in the US and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world, and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that is not accountable to anyone as a service to the public.
These spy revelations drew many proposals on new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously covert abuse of public trust.
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear; at the same time, the risks accepted have been visibly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat dissent as a breach of allegiance and strives to criminalize and impose political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this detrimental stance.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate appropriately and lawfully in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.

Driver who crashed between his legs at 210 km/h and hot drink receives £1,000 fine
A motorist was fined £1,000 for driving between his legs at up to 210 km/h and a hot drink.
Andrew Howie, 35, from Tiptree, Essex, was released on 27. May with his Mercedes Benz stopped on the A120 at Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinks cup between his legs.
In the Colchester District Court, Howie pleaded guilty without having driven the necessary care and attention.
He was awarded seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also sentenced to pay costs of £90 as well as a £100 casualty surcharge.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill playmates with machete
Two children have admitted the murder of an 11-year-old in Uruguay.
The two 14 and 12-year-old boys had invited their victim to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and threw the body into a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
They would then have played football in front of their apartments in a working-class neighborhood.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach resort of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger, who had taken her with her, was to testify that she had been sexually assaulted by the boy.
However, when the girl described the incident before the police without mentioning an attack against her, the two boys admitted the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
The reason cited, among other things, a rivalry in the football game.
He was provisionally admitted to a psychiatric youth centre.
Government in Jerusalem not confirming attack on Syrian air base
An American government official, who asked to remain anonymous, claimed Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Syria's Latakia a day earlier.
The target was "rockets and associated equipment" that the Israeli government feared was destined for Lebanon's Hezbollah, according to CNN.
Syrian and Lebanese media, as well as Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya, had earlier reported that the base in the port city of Latakia had been shelled on the night from Wednesday to Thursday, and blamed the Israelis for it.
The Israeli television channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia, on which Russian defensive missiles of the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles could be seen, which according to Channel 2 have a range of 35 kilometers and can transport warheads up to 70 kilograms.
Uncertain The government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, the Reuters news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government official as saying he believes Israel carried out the attack, but is not safe.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried, partly successfully, to deliver surface-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" that would be followed by a military response.
Traveling through mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical help to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
There are not many doctors in the West African country, just one for 5,000 people
Match here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for him to the "CNN Hero of the Year."
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father keep losing consciousness and traveling to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation formed, which spread to his brain and caused a hematoma there, which was to affect him for the rest of his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy," comments Bwelle.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and yet you are not first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has barely changed since Bwelle's father died in 2002.
There is only one doctor in Cameroon for 5,000 people each, according to the World Health Organization.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people.
But even if there was a doctor for them, most Cameroonians could not afford the visit.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” Bwelle said.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
Seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffering in Bwelle made the decision to do something about it matured.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team have conducted 700 free surgeries in the last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care there.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people squeeze into minibuses and drive with the tied-up medical equipment on the roof over unpaved terrain to the villages that need help.
Everything does not always go smoothly.
More than once, they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will receive like heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is really a cause for celebration and Bwelle – with his broad smile and limitless energy – likes to be present at the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team then begins examining hundreds of patients.
"We treat 500 people per trip," says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and that on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document required for school but simply unable to afford many poor families.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
The operations usually take place in a school, the town hall or an apartment; after the procedure, the patients get up and go into the recreation area to make way for the next.
The lighting for the surgery and disinfection equipment is fed by the group's generator and so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday.
It's a busy workload, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
“They drum all night so we can stay awake and continue our work,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team then heads back to the city, tired but proud of the work done.
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 free surgeries in the last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference for the people it helps.
A man explained that the free operation of a hernia he had received was now allowing him to return to work.
“This is changing the future of my family,” the man said.
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of his charitable work, according to Bwelle; the rest comes from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's asleep," says Katie O'Malley, who is studying medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia for her second year and volunteers to join Bwelle's group.
He's always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go on these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the U.S. and Europe and support Bwelle, this is a chance to gain hands-on experience they would never get at home.
“We can be involved in operations where we can help tap blood or the instruments for Dr. Bwelle hold," O'Malley explains.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon themselves and frequently bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transport and guidance.
"He's a hero without a doubt," says O'Malley.
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries.
For Bwelle, the almost constant work is not a burden.
Helping others to live happier lives and thus fulfill a promise he has made to his father gives him great joy.
"I'm so happy when I do this work," Bwelle said.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I do.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be on 22. February for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church appointed, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will thus appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election – this is the case with a group of 120 “eligible cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a spokesman for the Vatican, said it would hold a meeting of all the cardinals before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the Consistory, was held.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in advance in February so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned,” Lombardi said.
Catholic Voices' Jack Valero said the number of eligible cardinals was likely to have dropped by February.
He declared that a pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals entitled to vote would again be 120, and as many cardinals over 80 as he would like.
The consistory next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and in particular of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint Cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals founded by Francis, a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mandate to find opportunities to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He declared that it was "well possible" that Francis asks the Cardinals for advice.
But so far we have not been in this situation – this is all completely new.
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called to cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprises – so we do not know who he is appointing.”
Worker crashed from ladder: seriously injured
When replacing a defective external sensor on Thursday, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg crashed from a ladder and seriously injured himself.
The man from Lamprechtshausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the exterior façade of an inn.
As he climbed the ladder leaning against the gutter, it slipped away and the man crashed onto the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to Salzburg State Hospital with the rescue helicopter "Christophorus 6."
Is Europe's elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to the same table and defining what those who are responsible for prosperity and work in the UK would like to change in our relations with the EU.
To that end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about the UK, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, roughly reflecting UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernize and grow while states in the EU are stagnant.
They want the government to favour new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of dwelling on the long and exhausting process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about their view on certain legally regulated issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction about the single market, as, according to the company, the cost of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe’s trade zone – even 40 percent of large companies agreed, which are traditionally the most pro-European.
Finally, and this presumably says most, our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority want a course from Britain towards changing the deal and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations, shows that the economy is pushing for a "meaningful change" that brings the booklet of action back to the UK.
It's about a lot - a change to the deal and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum at 16 per cent.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that the UK economy stands behind his plan for the renegotiations of UK terms for EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the UK economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the result of our survey shows, which means increased attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations.
Place concert in high summer temperatures

In this context, Honeck thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first musician’s hock.
Learning instead of unemployed: Pilot project for unskilled people in tourism
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting today at the Mecklenburg Lake District.
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency, 49 women and men who already work as unskilled people in the industry are to be qualified as skilled workers for hotels and restaurants over three winters.
"What is new about this is that the six-month courses end with degrees," said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are manifold: the participants would not be unemployed, the companies would get trained specialists, who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the agency did not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chamber of Industry and Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
Dog friends successful
Once again, the athletes of the dog friends Bitz were successful at a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy he scored 94 points in the class Beginner and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley he made it to 12th place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp faced the critical glances of the judge with her Woody in class 1.
GM recalls new pickup trucks in U.S. to repair seat back
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seat back, according to a statement from the U.S. Vehicle Safety Regulatory Department on Friday.
For some of the trolleys, there may be a defect in the mechanism for resetting the front seat backrest.
For this reason, they do not meet federal vehicle safety guidelines for headrests.
“If it is driven from behind onto the vehicle, it is possible that the headrest does not protect the occupants properly, so there is an increased risk of injury,” the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website read.
The recalled models were between the 1. August and 10. September made.
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the leading U.S. automaker's major model launch since the 2009 bankruptcy-related restructuring.
GM informed the vehicle owners about the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on auto sales in October.
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, newly developed for the 2014 model year, has increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM shares rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
Mother sturned in the woods and pension conceded
When his elderly mother died, a man from Wolfsburg made a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care allowance.
In order to be able to collect further pensions and care allowance, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the forest after investigations by the police.
At first, he covered up the death of the 89-year-old, then he had collected the money for more than a year and a half.
Now, the 67-year-old must answer for fraud, as a spokesman said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was already suspected in May: At that time, it was noticed that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain.
Because this seemed strange to the officers, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had lived in a shared apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it.
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother.
An autopsy revealed no evidence of a capital crime, according to police.

Highlander Games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the brake car pulling with tractors, there are agricultural autumn festivals at the Kaltenhof from 6 to 8. September another second competition.
On Saturday, 7. September, the Highlander Games kick off at 13.30.
Although they have a Scottish tradition, they are Swabian on the Kaltenhof.
Teams and lone fighters compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water bucket carrying.
The tree trunk is four and a half meters long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It doesn't matter the far," explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be dropped vertically, should overturn once and then come to lie down.
This is rated with the most points.
When throwing horseshoes, it depends on the target accuracy.
From eight meters away is thrown at a stake.
The participants must prove skill and strength when carrying water buckets over 50 meters.
Time and amount of water in a vat are measured at the end.
From each "clan" or team, two may then participate in the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competition will receive prizes.
Training can be done as early as 10 a.m.
A suitable clothing is desired, for example, the competitors can compete in the Schottenrock.
But Swabian costume is also allowed.
For the "outfit" the jury awards a few more bonus points.
You can register up to one hour before the start of the competition.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highlander games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour earlier, a lot of action is already on the agenda at the festival grounds on Saturday.
In the evening, the brass music lovers get their money's worth.
At 7 p.m., the biraboehmian brass music from Schömberg designs the big entertainment evening.
The chapel plays fast polkas and marches.
Her repertoire also includes soulful waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch from Weilen, known as a singing host and black sausage baron, will be present.
In Dornhan he has already performed at the Christmas market and at the fool's guild.
On Sunday, the Musikverein Leinstetten entertains for early shopping, from 14 o'clock the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then let the festival end.
The stop-part with DJ Ralf is already the start on Friday.
Other program items on Saturday and Sunday include the classic car and smuggling meeting, exhibitions of companies on the subject of agriculture and forestry.
Other attractions on Sunday include the corn maze, the craftsman's market and sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a petting zoo, straw bouncy castle, tractor driving (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organizers are the Förderverein Mehrzweckhalle, the Skiclub and the Traktorfreunde "Zündkäpsele".
Kenyan press outraged over controversial media law
“We are in a frightening situation and one may ask ourselves: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?” was read in the newspaper, which considers the draft law not constitutional.
"The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, which also includes CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased, because it's an extended arm of the government," and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's standing in the global economy.
"I hope the president listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new law puts the government “effectively in a stranglehold.” On the other hand, The Standard writes that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have suffered "a serious blow" and titled the draft as "draconian".
The adoption of the law is among a series of measures to strengthen national security in the aftermath of attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September.
Kenyan media drew the ire of the authorities for posting footage from security cameras showing the units dispatched to the scene of the crime allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative to interrogate, even if the subpoena was withdrawn following an outcry from the media.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the right to seize the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “already a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy.”
In addition, the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya's "liveable blogosphere" in its description.
If they silence the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
"No one will ever experience it," wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist with the nation who describes the Kenyan media as a crucial control factor in public life.
"If you leave politicians to themselves, they lead the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of the hunter-gatherers," he said.
Kenyan lawmakers have been attracting public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Compensation Commission and put their hearty salaries of about 532,000 shillings tax-free per month back into effect - they are among the world's highest.
2014 will be Geisinger Festjahr
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250.
Returning the first documentary mention is approaching.
When the year comes to an end in a good eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming up.
Geisingen and Kirchen-Hausen were first mentioned together in 794.
In churches, a document was produced in which both places are mentioned.
On the 15th March is supposed to be an official kick-off for the anniversary year, and since Geisingen currently has no hall, this kick-off event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in Kirchen-Hausen.
As part of the anniversary, several events are planned both in Geisingen and in Kirchen-Hausen.
Kirchen-Hausen will be held in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20. July the 1250.
Returning to celebrate.
On Friday with a ceremony, on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle.
On this weekend, there is also the Kirchen-Hausen church festival.
City Music Director Rudolf Barth has written a commissioned composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary, which will be performed on three dates.
On the 21. June together with the Solstice celebration of the Black Forest Association, on the 12th July at the arena with fireworks and on the 13th. December as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle.
This will be finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year, the official date is on the last weekend of September, on 27 and 28. September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary, a new chronicle will also be published.
"However, it should become a chronicle not only of Geisingen itself, but a printed work about the Geisingen of today, which consists precisely of Geisingen, Kirchen-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen," says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And the Geisingen of today also celebrates its birthday in 2014, in 1974 the present space was completed with the incorporations.
The new chronicle is then scheduled to take place on 21 or 22. November will be presented in the new Festhalle in Geisingen.
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries.
The fool's guild Strohglonki begins on the 8th. February with a customs evening on the occasion of its 60th anniversary, the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has on 29. March the banquet and then celebrates from 1 to 4. May the District Music Festival.
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on the 10th anniversary. May, the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen turns 150 years old and celebrates this as part of the Brunnenfest from 4 to 7. July.
The town of Geisingen was awarded a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen is, first mentioned in the year 764.
The document was made in churches (houses), which was then a court place.
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old accordingly in 2014, in addition, the municipal reform is 40 years ago.
Also this year on the name day of St. Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien celebrates a Hubertus Fair on Hülsbergstraße.
St. According to legend, Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter, who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liège.
The hunting horn brass group of the Jagdreiter Westfalen under the direction of Brigitte Kluth makes music on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood Es) according to old, originally French melodies.
The winds wear riding clothes because they primarily accompany riders, horses and dog crowds on tow hunts musically.
The solemn Mass will take place on Sunday, 3. November, at 11.30pm.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
It's a big victory for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court decided today that the health care law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By five to four votes, the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- it forces U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 -- is constitutional under the state's tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the chamber, while the judges ruled Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy against it.
The court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held the view that the health law stipulate that states would either have to extend the admission requirements for Medicaid or otherwise all state Medicaid funding would be deleted was not unconstitutionally restrictive.
The lawsuit was brought by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law had been strongly opposed by all the leading Republican presidential candidates, including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
The happiness of the dreaming camels
Happiness is an oasis that succeeds in reaching only dreaming camels
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association "Helping Hands".
On Saturday afternoon, the club's 10th birthday was celebrated, which can already show considerable success.
The first chairman, Henne, reported in detail on the work of the association.
He himself was in 2004 for the first time in Mauritania at the Cheijk-Zajed hospital in Nouakchott.
As a result, a further cooperation developed, and the gynaecologist Henne carried out numerous operations on site on several trips.
During the speeches, pictures of the stakes were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the mentioned actions.
The club's desert vehicle was also shown.
It is a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had made the proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now, according to Henne, plans to act in an advisory capacity at the association.
In 2008, the Schleeh carpentry shop from Baiersbronn created the infirmary in Socogim, a miserable district on the outskirts of the capital - on a voluntary basis in the record time of just under a week.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
Particularly interesting in times when the maternity hospital in Nagold is to be rationalized away.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, according to Henne, for example, deceleration against burn-out.
Due to the political unrest in the country, it was not possible to undertake as many trips as planned, but many physicians came to Germany to work here in various areas.
In addition, containers of material are regularly sent to Africa, such as medical equipment, medicines, dressing material, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Co-initiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself provided plenty of local color by telling from Mauritania about Mercedes vehicles converted into a mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of the Stammheim musicians, who traditionally support the association, on their Mauritania trip.
As his personal motivations, he cited his work in the field of auditing as a young member of parliament.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans in controlling a budget by the people.
In addition, Fuchtel emphasized that global economy also demands global human love.
It should also not be forgotten that Africa is closer than some think.
From Gran Canaria it is not far to Africa.
The more than 100-year-old natural stone wall as a front demarcation of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, which is before the renovation, is to be reimbursed again on the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small angular wall, for stabilization and static relief of the more than one hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade was installed in the first works of the renovation of the front schoolyard.
According to Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt, the further procedure provides for the planning to include the state monument office and to create a renovation concept for the old wall.
Thereafter, a cost calculation is to be carried out by experts, which is then to be placed on the table for the municipal council to decide and determine the further procedure.
A decision on this is expected to be made as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the boundary wall in need of renovation must be renovated from scratch and put on a new substructure in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure.
The historic, one hundred-year-old demarcation wall of the old schoolyard to Kirchstraße, is mainly due to water and frost damage, since there is no drainage, in need of renovation and has a bow inclination forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage, but the wall is currently not at risk of collapse.
A stable wall is a prerequisite for one of students used schoolyard, which is done by the current fastening work.
Originally, the schoolyard renovation was planned even in 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditures brought a postponement.
The state monument office will have a say in the historic renovation of the school wall, which has even been used for filming.
Should guidelines come from this side, then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the preservationists.
The students of the Bräunlingen elementary school, who are now again taught in a well-renovated old school building with a new auditorium, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
USA: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning (local time).
While the airport management said via the short message service Twitter that the gunman was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media also reported several people injured.
U.S. President Barack Obama is constantly being informed about the situation, White House spokesman Jay Carney said.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3. Eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman with a rifle in one of the departure halls, according to several media reports.
One traveler told CNN that many people had sought shelter in panic.
Travellers would have screamed and children cried.
Panic broke out among those waiting, many had hidden behind chairs out of fear.
He heard two shots, a traveler told the Los Angeles Times.
An employee of the security agency TSA had suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie."
He was taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shots are said to have fallen near a security checkpoint.
Airport building evacuated
Television pictures showed numerous ambulances and police vans driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were taken to safety from the building.
Users on Twitter posted photos of a special operations commando and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9.30 in the morning (local time).
The access roads were closed, which formed long backlogs, according to CNN.
With the exception of landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended, it said.
However, several planes were also observed on CNN at the start.
Terminal 3 is mainly served by smaller U.S. airlines.
Los Angeles's LAX Airport is a largest airport in the United States.
Gutach: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 meters apart: On Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian traffic light at the village parking lot was put into operation in Gutach - within sight of the older town hall traffic light.
Two plants so close to each other: intention or shield citizen prank?
Gutach's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday.
"The town hall traffic light was installed at that time, because it secures the way to school," Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser traffic light secures both cyclists and bus passengers and the Bergle residents.
The plant, which was officially commissioned yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection area.
We have the museum, two churches, spa park, the bus stop, a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area ›Grub‹.
"With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians, another traffic light had to be used to ensure their safety," says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from the district office of Offenburg.
"According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day on the B 33, of which about ten percent are heavy-duty traffic," emphasizes Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary: "Safety is simple here," says Arnold.
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out, a roundabout was also considered, but because of the narrowness in the intersection area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße again rejected.
According to Arnold, everything was previously tested in the choice of location of the traffic light masts: "By means of a transporter specially loaded for us with particularly long logs, we have tested whether these vehicles can drive out of the Sulzbachweg on the B 33 without bending the traffic light mast".
The traffic light system itself, which costs around 15 000 euros, is the "most modern thing currently available on the market," Arnold explained.
The system is equipped with colored LEDs that glow so strongly that the lights can be easily recognized by the motorists, for example, even when the sun is low.
And it is also economical: the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction of travel.
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant: This is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, greenery for the pedestrian comes immediately, if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated.
"Should a group or disabled people cross the road, the green phase will be extended, so everyone will come safely across the road," Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver has to think as a partner and observe the road.
This was not the case yesterday: As soon as the traffic light for pedestrians showed green, an upper-class vehicle rushed through - with bright red.
Long breath pays off
Six men's teams competed for the winning title at the tennis tournament of the clubs.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
The tennis department of Sportfreunde Rohrdorf had received a dream weather for the tournament of local clubs and friends.
The fun of playing tennis was at the forefront of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the schedule, with each playing against each.
It was played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum of 45 minutes duration.
Anja Schlichter leads the tournament
The tournament management was in the proven hands of Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were level on points with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both teams of the SG Rohrweiler), so the last two matches had to bring the decision.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the hiking cup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was occupied by the double Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
Rainer and Bernd Maier of the Asphaltriecher team reached the bronze podium.
With late afternoon sun and coffee and cake, the successful end of the tournament took place.
Bird rescued by North Sea rig service released again by air rescue service
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue service, which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling island, was released back into nature.
The water ralle was flown to Aberdeen last month by helicopter, where it was puffed up by the Scottish animal welfare charity SPCA at its rescue centre in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water rall was probably a wintry migratory bird from northern Europe, stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea."
Apparently, the exhausted bird sought refuge on the rig.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with the request for help."
Upon their release, the water rall was fit and healthy again.
Drug tunnel with own railway between the US and Mexico discovered
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the U.S. and Mexico, which was fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric rail operation, has now been discovered.
U.S. authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would have ever found.
The tunnel, which zigzs, over a length of just under six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs.
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized in it, the authorities said.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured, according to the court's records.
Three men who worked as drivers, according to authorities, were charged with possession and intended sale of marijuana and cocaine.
They face prison sentences of between ten years and life in the event of a guilty verdict.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how to quickly bring their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 640-metre-long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to 'entituity' test
The government is considering a "authenticity test" for foreign workers with a 457 visa as part of extended measures.
Should the test be introduced, it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door for the influx of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a government discussion proposal was published after the Labor Party's former lawmaker, Maxine McKew, condemned the government's comments regarding foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia's neighbours.
“Loud explanations such as ‘foreigners should put themselves behind’ and ‘Hiring Australians first’ are a very unpleasant relapse in times when unions have called for a protected labour market,” she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, that meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region heard an echo of this historical artifact, I would not be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once envisaged by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday for talks on people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others are still being considered.
If the "actuality criterion" is adopted, then someone applying for a visa could be verified to determine whether "the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company."
Companies could also be required to give account of the number of 457 visa holders, after in the past companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker presumably died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island with a refugee boat this week.
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man, who had come to Australia with him, has been cared for since his father's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
Norway: Norwegian place makes light with giant mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley.
Due to the low level of sun incidence, the Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord Valley, usually sinks from autumn to spring in the shade of the surrounding mountains.
With three gigantic reflectors at a height of 45 meters, a dream of the century came true on Wednesday.
"Finally!" Mayor Steinar Bergsland enthused at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers adjusted to sun chairs, others put on sunglasses for safety.
Until now, sun-seekers have had to take a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, the local artist Martin Andersen had presented the proposal to direct the rays into the valley with mirrors.
However, this basic idea has existed in the village since 1913.
After several years of debate, the city council had finally adopted the 5 million crown (around 615 000 euros) project.
A similar construction has been giving winter sunshine to the Italian Alpine resort of Viganella for several years.
Union and SPD have continued their coalition negotiations with the issues of home affairs and justice.
In addition, the responsible working group met in the morning in Berlin.
Among other things, it is about direct democracy, deputies bribery and the federal police.
In the morning, the Working Group on Migration and Integration also wanted to continue its discussions.
Among other things, it should be about the issue of dual citizenship, in which both sides have opposing ideas.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for German-born immigrant children to opt for one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the subject of transport, which is not on the agenda this Friday, the SPD backed up its no to a car toll demanded by the CSU.
A vignette is a "flat rate for frequent driving and thus ecologically counterproductive," explained the SPD negotiator for the subject of transport, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a threat of avoidance traffic on country roads, which were already accident focal points.
The introduction of a toll for all passenger cars would also be only a first step from Pronold’s point of view.
"There is a risk that at a later date, compensation for Germans will be canceled," he said.
Shrill beeping disturbs residents
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land.
They distribute the coal coming from the ships to the heap.
The company has several irons in the fire at the site.
In addition to coal importing, Rhenus Midgard relies on wind turbine logistics, among other things.
Black shimmers the coal in the storage area in front of the dike.
Two huge blue stockpile and backloaders distribute or load the coal here as needed.
With every movement of the handling devices, a shrill warning noise sounds over the terrain.
"The signals serve safety and are required by law," says Matthias Schrell, managing director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, with unfavorable winds, this can be heard widely - and so there have already been some complaints from people from the city north.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted those affected, says the 40-year-old.
In close consultation with the authorities, it is now in the process of keeping the warning signs quieter with technical measures.
In the future, he will continue to focus on open dialogue with the neighbours.
Matthias Schrell still has a lot to do at the location.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to focus on coal imports for power plants and is one of the big ones in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the lying tub in front of the terminal, which is recessed at 18.5 metres, capesize bulk carriers can also be handled here for a long time.
"This year, we want to break the 3 million ton mark when it comes to the envelope," says Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on site, the import coal goes to power plants inland.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is still connected to the grid, a good 5 million tonnes of coal import per year would be realistic.
The three ship unloaders on the bridge, as well as the second conveyor belt, could create up to 10 million.
Kindergarten has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier.
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in Gartenstraße to a private person.
The sale was approved by the local council in its most recent meeting in the non-public part.
The building changed its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied," Maier points out.
The budget was allocated 100 000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to pay for the maintenance of the house, how to heat, look for the garden and clear the sidewalk.
"This effort is now gone," says Maier.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was little, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets, stay up late and dress up for the neighborhood.
Today I became more of a Halloween muffle.
In the last two years, I have not agreed to distribute sweets from my apartment, and probably will not do it this year.
But according to statistics, I'm a black sheep as far as Halloween is concerned.
The majority of Americans – 158 million, to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the U.S. Association of Retailers (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values.
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, inciting inanimate items are the last cry.
Women no longer have to wrap themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead, and I bet the daft punk spacemen will make it to the Instagram feeds this year.
According to Google, the most wanted costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I suspect there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed up our dogs last year and were not alone in my astonishment.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on costumes of their pets, according to the NRF.
That’s a lot of “hot dogs.”
As for sweets, we're not squeamish.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on it this year, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars, lollipops, candy and gummy bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who move through the neighborhoods with the saying "sweet or sour" according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let’s not fool ourselves – eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn; nevertheless, 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween, according to the National Association of Confectionery Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn grains.
It's a mystery I haven't been able to solve.
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses where it haunts.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (which, by the way, is in a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos in which you just pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you can’t get rid of them, and then leave a comment to you the guy you’re into, like “nice facial expression.”
But let's finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were children, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we did from a young age.
Fortunately, the "baby in the pumpkin" trend only started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The pumpkin lantern, which slowly rots in the front yard, is believed to have come from Illinois, where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year.
If you want to score right, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921 kilo pumpkin.
Pimp must go to prison
Because of exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threat, insult and dangerous bodily harm, the District Court of Konstanz has a 33-year-old man from St. Georgen sentenced to three and a half years in prison.
The former Bundeswehr soldier, who worked as a bouncer after two deployments in Afghanistan, made a confession as part of a trial agreement.
In five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he sent after a few weeks against their will on the line.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
The income of the women, some of whom bought for him for years, he retained.
Through confiscation of mobile phones and SIM cards, he prevented women's contacts with the outside world.
Together with a colleague who brokered the women, he took them to various brothels in the Southwest.
There, he had them partially monitored to control their earnings.
In court, the defendant initially claimed he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion alongside him.
After a psychiatric expert indicated great doubts about the psychological restriction and thus a limited culpability, the 33-year-old made a comprehensive confession.
The court no longer had to hear any of the women harmed.
As a police officer reported, after an initial report by telephone surveillance measures, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking could be determined.
The intercepted conversations were marked by high aggression.
In later interrogations, the injured parties would have confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, in which one of the women had discovered bruises all over his body, had not made a statement to date.
It is "a completely broken personality" who regards violence and exploitation in this profession as normal.
The defendant regretted his conduct yesterday.
"He had broken away from these circles and wanted to live a normal life after detention," he said.
Tripodi denies having been influenced by Obeid
Former minister of Labor Party Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being launched into an investigation by state corruption oversight.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the regulations on maritime lease at the request of his political mentor, Eddie Obeid, who owned covert stakes in three properties on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend leases at Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe, without any tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, it is being investigated over the accusation that Tripodi had known about Obeid's undercover interest in the properties, after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole testified accordingly on Thursday.
In years of talks that began in 2005, the government had pushed for public tenders for the leases.
The tenants were against it and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, the leases for the companies at Circular Quay, which brought the Obeids $2.5 million annually, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009, had originally advocated for public tenders.
Yet he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a reshaping of the government's leasehold regulations.
A telephone transcript submitted to the ICAC featured conversations from August and September 2007 between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid at the Fisheries Authority.
"Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the drafting of the commercial lease arrangements?" asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No," Tripodi replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
NSA revelations reinforce company paranoia over government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
At the instruction of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and Counter-Terrorism (BAT), the German Interior Intelligence Service, he was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BAT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, American Director of National Intelligence, insisted in September that the U.S. did not use foreign espionage “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit.”
But since Edward Snowden, the one-time employee who has become a whistleblower, has begun publishing his cornucopia on U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate chief executives have no longer been sure whether to take the director at their word.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobas and has obtained data from American cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have brought the company paranoia to a new high because of government surveillance.
The barrel to overflow brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then company managements are certainly also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence agencies and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data will be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up," explains Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the U.S. now posed almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published by the consulting firm EY in July.
However, in the documents leaked by Snowden, there has been no evidence so far that the US has passed on the trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU lacked certain IT and internet opportunities and should reduce their dependence on the US.
Companies are skeptical about this.
In the Bundestag it was suggested that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"That's not how it works," says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software manufacturer SAP.
If you had wanted a strong European IT industry, you should not have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything except the IT industry.
Still, range and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies uncovered by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the biggest espionage risk in China.
There is a major change in cloud computing, because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the USA is subject to the case law there and is therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trading institution, after the revelations about the U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about ten percent of non-U.S.-based members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP’s deputy managing director, says: “We see a new question from customers that didn’t exist a year ago – it says: Where will my data be stored and can you guarantee that it will physically remain in this jurisdiction?”
Many German company managers take the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, namely that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and therefore they must be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is taking place is no surprise.
It's always been like that.
“It has been a topic for many years and has not fundamentally changed as a result of the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, Chairman of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we do, because it is in the national interest to defend our companies.
Corporate governance does not usually boast about the countermeasures that have been taken, because this gives attackers benefits.
In large companies, employees have long been taught that taking a free USB stick at a trade fair or unguarded lying down a laptop in the hotel room is not advisable, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a board member at car manufacturer Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the mobile phones before a board meeting so that they cannot be used as wiretaps.
The German BVT advises executives to use simple prepaid phones when they go on trips abroad because smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is a concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are the global market leaders in the respective niche.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets against unauthorized access,” the BVT warns in a report.
The U.S. warns of its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, France, Russia and Israel were ranked second behind China in the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate in February, which used to obtain economic data from the hacking.
A board member of a German blue-chip company agreed that when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: “The intelligence services know very well that all countries, even if they work together in the fight against terror, are spying on their allies.”
When the horse show experts gathered in droves in Cardiff to choose the horse of the year, they were aware that fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The crunch, who isn't even in kindergarten yet and only took his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee trotted loosely through the three rounds and picked up the first prize - leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable couple, both of the same size, have been praised for their demeanour, behaviour and style at the annual competition hosted by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his plate cap on at a cheeky angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony, which were far above his age.
And Toffee received top marks for his demeanor and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and has been practicing with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team."
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and have walked off the pitch with Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee in a competition, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Complete strangers in the arena considered him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been performing horses for over ten years.
Howells recounted, “The whole audience was like electrified and everyone cheered him on and clapped.”
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of.
The way he started, it won’t be long before he’s on the “Horse of the Year” show – and I’m sure he’ll do well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to deal with his pony."
Together they are a great team.
The judges assessed Fenton and Toffee afterwards how well they would have beaten each other and presented themselves in the screening ring.
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's sweet clothes did their part, that really fit the occasion perfectly.
Nursing day at the small English hut
For the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project upper Hotzenwald, a group of committed participants met at the small English hut in Ibach.
Due to suggestions from the population, the view into the valley should be cut free on this day in the area of the hut, said Mayor Helmut Kaiser.
Many hikers described this area as the highlight of the canyon trail, on which the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and emphasized that the nursing day was a suitable tool to strengthen the connection between people and nature.
It offers every citizen the opportunity to set accents in nature itself.
At the same time as the tourist aspect, the ecological consideration could also be taken into account.
Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Nature Conservation of the Regional Council of Freiburg explained this ecological aspect following the welcome by District Administrator Tilman Bollacher, who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success.
According to Tribukait, the tourist destination of the far-sight is in line with the aim of preserving the now strongly grown old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types through opening and connecting to the still existing pastures.
Certain species such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas.
You need these free connections for species conservation.
Tribukait said she did not want to fail to break a lance at this point for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous nursing days for the future.
After these various explanations, district manager Christoph Wehle and life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been knocked in advance, the forestry tractor was possibly ready to call.
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of juniper bushes and the maintenance of a dry stone bar.
The goal was the clear view at the viewpoint.
Experienced an entertaining afternoon with music
For 15 years, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then to a Vesper.
In the past, the elderly citizens were served in the rest area.
Meanwhile, this afternoon will take place in the nursing home St. Joseph instead.
The residents were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
There was sausage salad later.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies.
Königsfeld: Small team fights bravely
The volunteer fire department mastered their autumn main rehearsal despite lack of staff with flying colours.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his exercise assumption.
There is said to have been a short circuit during sawing.
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
Two respirators of the weir prepared to enter the building after the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer.
After a short time, it was possible to find the first person and lead him out into the open.
The second person had to be worn.
This was not so easy, as a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
It stored a lot of wood and also straw bales in it.
There were also electrical machines for woodworking.
The first firefighting attack was carried out over the tank in the vehicle.
A further line was carried out via an overhead hydrant at a distance of about 100 metres.
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed.
A hollow jet pipe was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer was also about showing what can be done with little available staff.
In an emergency, support is provided via the Königsfeld daily operations group.
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise.
Iran satisfied with trial of nuclear negotiations
Iran is pleased with the negotiation process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years, we now have an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency to resolve the differences of recent years," Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif wrote on his Facebook page.
While there would still be a long way to go, the nuclear chief negotiator is satisfied with the negotiation process and is also optimistic that in the end both sides will come to a solution.
Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions linked to the $325 million bailout for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure the state's government can't waste the money.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island nation, a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions.
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government deliberations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilkie.
"The government has put together an emergency rescue package that, in our view, addresses the unique challenges facing the state," Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in emergency aid for electoral benefits.
A further 2600 operations, including orthopaedic interventions and treatments due to cataracts, are to be eliminated.
In addition, there is money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better follow-up after inpatient stays, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the ideas that affected clinic staff have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system,” said Tanya Plibersek.
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability from the Tasmanian government.
The state must maintain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds were spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use if "they are not accompanied by real reforms that put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable course."
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I am confident that federal aid will make a huge contribution to taking the state's public health system off the worry list," Wilkie said.
According to the state's government, these electoral benefits will largely make up for the recent cuts.
But the opposition's health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes that today's announcement is only a "pavement solution."
"We are in today's situation because the Labor State government has withdrawn $430 million from the health care system," he told ABC TV.
It cannot be that a state government is ripping nearly half a billion dollars out of the system and putting the Commonwealth 300 million into it and then pretending that's good news.
Dutton urged Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
In protest against the planned wealth tax, French football will actually go through the first strike since 1972.
A conciliation meeting comes to an end without result.
In the conflict over the wealth tax, the government and professional football in France have maneuvered into an impasse after a failed arbitration meeting.
President François Hollande received club and association representatives at the Paris Élysée Palace on Thursday and also listened to their complaints.
However, he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent levy on income of more than one million euros per year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side also remained tough.
The strike, announced for the end of November, will now also be carried out, said the head of the Association of Professional Clubs (UCPF), Jean-Pierre Louvel.
The one between the 29th November and the 2. December scheduled matchdays in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 are thus cancelled.
Proverbs come from the Bible
A good 40 women attended the last women's breakfast of this year in the Protestant parish of Bisingen.
The theme of the day in the church house was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Idioms from the Middle Ages."
Zita Köhler, the chairwoman of the parish council, addressed the biblical proverbs in a lecture after breakfast.
"Proverbs contain life wisdom, regulations or warnings," she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible passages and explained the meaning.
She called proverbs like: Wooden eye is alert, as scales fall from the eyes, cast an eye on someone, the Lord gives his own in his sleep, washing his hands in innocence.
Several times, the speaker also let her listeners guess what the saying was.
The church councillor Christel Dehner took on the idioms from the Middle Ages: All good things are three, blue, somewhat spanked.
She explained the meaning and origin of the idioms, which she called "bridges to the past."
Finally, a tombola was raffled.
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously circumscribed before being handed over to the winners.
Mayoral candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed among the visitors to the breakfast round.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a seeker of God, a metaphysician, his novels and narratives also have something serial.
Surprising the kinship in the exterior: the pungent eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And so, like Fjodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre, is to be understood as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul, is read by Philip K. Dick as an American prophet, who is quite true in his own country.
Some titles have been published by Heyne Verlag, the Haffmans cassette with the 118 narratives distributes two-thousand-one.
Dick explains America - the realm of stunning technical progress, coupled with paranoia, security delusion and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had experiences of God, his late books read like a mixture of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, had drugs added to his brain.
He understood, early on, that the computers are divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what distinguishes a human from a machine, the Creator from his creature.
This is the "Blade Runner" problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors such as Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minorities Report" dates back to 1956, it exudes the smell of the Cold War and the McCarthy tribunals.
The principle of "pre-crime" is being developed here, "pre-crime," that is, what is now more or less official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which resembles ours terrifyingly, mutants look to the future - and the police are reaching out.
"We are capturing individuals who have not violated any law," the head of the authority says.
“We’ll grab them before they can commit a violent crime.”
“There are no serious criminals in our society, but we have a prison camp full of pesudo criminals.” They read time streams.
They assume that evil happens, and prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's narrative acts like the blueprint for the NSA's anti-terrorism laws and the NSA's wiretap.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story isn't over yet.
The police chief complains that there is no longer a separation of powers, the military controls everyday life - and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and convicted of a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It invents its own presuppositions.
Not only accepts errors and victims, but also builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Philip K. To read fat is to get closer to the truth.
Court blocks decision on NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy
A federal appeals court in the U.S. on Thursday blocked the order of a judge who had called for changes to the New York Police Department's stop-and-frisk program ("Hand and Search"), and relieved the judge of the case.
The 2. U.S. Court of Appeals said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions would be suspended until an appeal by the city was decided.
The judge had ruled in August that the city violated the constitution with the way the program for stopping and questioning people would be implemented.
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedial measures, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending their policy and the appropriate training programme.
The appeals court on Tuesday heard the arguments on the required suspension.
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be relieved of the case as she violated the code of conduct for U.S. judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partisanship; this was partly justified with a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of material changes, including reforms to policies, training and service supervision, and ordered a pilot program with body-worn cameras in neighborhoods where most of the checks were carried out.
In August, the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released again after a check by police.
An oral hearing on the appeal of the city is after the 14th. March 2014 planned.
The stop-and-frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates.
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded checks during the tenure of the non-party mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom belonged to minorities, filed suit, which developed into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force, as well as influence the way other police presidiums use the scheme.
Opponents believe the changes would dampen the morale of the police, but not crime; also, money would be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that would be under pressure after the elimination of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reforms the nature of the NYPD's implementation of the controls.
Anger over verdict for Bali bomber
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily at the verdict for the last of the instigators to be brought to justice, as Umar Patek was to be shot downright in her view.
Patek, who was on the run for almost ten years as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted persons, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
With a penalty suspension, he could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder over the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many more injured.
A guilty verdict was also made in a series of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of explosives attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had demanded a life sentence, even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man, who is also referred to as a "demolition man" because of his reputation as a master bomb maker.
The decision has evoked painful memories at June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters, Jane and Jenny, in the devastation wrought by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago.
Fighting with tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really mean, he should follow in the other guys' footsteps.
"You should put him before a firing squad," Corteen told AAP.
I have to live every day with the fact that I won't have any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was leveled to the ground when on the 12th October 2002, shortly after 2 p.m., a huge bomb exploded in a small truck parked in front of the nightclub.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives.
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack and "died" three times while he was hanging on to a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist cell - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were responsible for the carnage and were executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To let him live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after he killed 202 people and wounding many hundreds isn't much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He evaded nearly a decade of arrest, but was eventually apprehended in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces nearly four months later killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent testified that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't turn himself in," Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people.
The verdict came ahead of the ten-year anniversary of this year's attack, which is being celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
Spying affair around Merkel in Russia testify
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US spy affair around German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Federal Prosecutor's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, the agency Interfax reported.
Earlier, the Greens member of parliament Hans-Christian Ströbele was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to talk to him about the affair.
Leg almost chopped off: Reissue of Rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is re-rolled after more than four years.
A trial for attempted manslaughter, dangerous bodily harm and damage to property against two 30-year-olds has begun before the District Court of Frankfurt (Oder).
He is accompanied by strict safety precautions.
The defendants were silent at the start.
They are said to have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the Bandidos at the time.
The prosecution accuses them of having stabbed and smashed three men in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt.
All the victims were seriously injured, a man almost lost his leg.
The victims are said to have belonged to the competing Hells Angels group.
One is said to have been a high-ranking member from Berlin.
This was preceded by a chase with several cars.
According to the indictment, it was about precinct fights and a demonstration of power.
The two defendants had been acquitted in early 2012 in a first trial.
A court spokesman said at the time that it had not been proven that the men had actually been involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized.
The Federal Court of Justice overturned the verdict after appealing the public prosecutor's office and referred it back to the district court for retrial.
One of the defendants is currently in open custody for another offence.
The main start was about the reconstruction of the processes on the night of the crime.
As a witness, the commissioner investigating at the time was invited.
At the center were cellphone conversations of the defendants and other people, which the police had wiretapped.
What is difficult is that rockers in court almost always adhere to a law that is iron for them - and do not testify.
This also applies to the victims.
In the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt (Oder) public prosecutor's office said on request that new traces had emerged since the last trial.
Eleven more days of negotiations are scheduled for the trial.
Pamela Anderson separates from her legendary blonde curls and performs for the first time with a new boy's head.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous since her role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock his fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has split from her long blonde curls in favor of a platinum blonde short haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look in Los Angeles on Wednesday and also immediately put a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the modest change.
What do you think about Pammy's hair?

The number of people without a job dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the ratio of 3.1 percent is better than last year and also better than in September, "we would have hoped for more," says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the Employment Agency in Sonthofen.
Because numerous companies have so far reacted behaviorally in attitudes.
One reason for this, according to Felder-Bauer: "We have hardly any skilled workers in the trade, in health care and in the care of the elderly".
Due to the season, job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have also been running since September.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report can be found in the Allgäuer display sheet of 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Traffic light on permanent red: Pay attention to waiting time
Sometimes a traffic light just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop in the road does not react, or the light sign is defective.
What should you do - drive at red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the intersection is free, he can continue, explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
However, the waiting time must be "appropriate", which could be interpreted differently from case to case.
Becker advises to endure at least five minutes before the traffic light is to be assumed to be a malfunction.
Anyone who continues the journey despite red light, however, must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by this.
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Hamm Higher Regional Court.
In the negotiated case, a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light violation.
The traffic light was not defective, but jumped to green a little later.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but the fine was not.
Bombardier profit losses after decline in delivery figures and orders
Canadian aircraft and rail maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday after coming under pressure from declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter, as well as contract problems in the rail division.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use next September according to the ambitious schedule.
Only three more take-offs have so far followed the maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago, which makes it questionable whether the test phase will proceed as planned.
The results fell short of forecasts, leading to a price plunge of over eight percent on the Toronto stock exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, on Thursday lowered his valuation from "outperform" to "sector perform" in view of the stock having limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
"Although weaker delivery figures for aircraft were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the development of margins in the transport sector," said Doerksen in a customer letter.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program advances for the aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the CSeries aircraft line can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
But so far, binding orders for the CSeries are moderate at 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-savings potential of the new jet airliner are accurate.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
Pierre Beaudoin, Chairman of the Board of Management, is confident that Bombardier will achieve its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet.
The company management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was in the schedule.
"The test aircraft has not stayed on the ground any longer than expected," Beaudoin said on a conference call, adding that during the aircraft's downtime, ground tests and software updates had been scheduled.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then anshred a revision period, which we did.
This is done throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to launch in the next few weeks, the remaining shortly after, it said on the part of the company.
Nevertheless, analysts remain skeptical whether twelve months after the maiden flight, the first customer can commission an aircraft of the CSeries.
Bombardier said it is reviewing planning for commissioning (EIS) and will update it in the next few months.
“The slow progress of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier’s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will shift to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
in the third quarter ended at the 30th. September fell Bombardier's net profit to $147 million, or 8 cents per share of $172 million, or 9 cents per share the year before.
Adjusted earnings per share remain unchanged 9 cents.
Revenue declined marginally, down from 4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft this quarter, a drop of 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The order backlog in the aerospace division was on 30. September $32.9 billion, compared to the 31st December unchanged.
"In the aerospace sector, the results were within our targets, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing," said Beaudoin.
Revenue in the aerospace division fell 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail manufacturer, announced that sales in this division have increased by just under 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport division was 30. September $32.6 billion, compared to the 31st December slightly increased.
The profit margin in the area of transport was affected by settlement problems on some large contracts.
According to the company management, there will be new targets for the fourth quarter.
In afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier shares fell 8.5 percent and stood at $4.83 after also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette would move to the board.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a ten percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Regulations on electronic devices on aircraft remain in force provisionally in effect in Australia
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at take-off and landing, despite efforts in the U.S. to loosen regulations on such devices.
The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows U.S. airlines to change their specifications so that passengers on their devices can read, watch or play e-books during critical flight phases, if they are in “flight mode”.
During the majority of the flight, passengers are already allowed to do so, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books on take-off and landing.
Australian companies are observing the decision to implement which U.S. airlines have to do vast amounts of work to implement, but are not pursuing immediate plans to change their regulations.
The air traffic control agency CASA also said it would look at the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply.
"CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft," it said.
The issue is subject to regulations requiring airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already held talks with CASA about a use expansion of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights, saying it is open to change, but that they must be initiated by the legislator.
"We would welcome a review of the approval of electronic devices by CASA, because we are convinced that this would enhance the customer experience after now offering (wireless entertainment) during the flight," a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would remain with the current regulations until further notice.
“Our current policies stipulate that electronic devices must not be used on take-off and landing, and we currently have no plans to change that,” the company said in a statement.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations from which passengers can benefit, and will certainly take a close look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision has a different effect on U.S. companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile radio interference, and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs, and customer instruction.
“After an airline confirms the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, lighter electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any level,” the FAA announced.
In rare cases in poor visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to shut down the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended storing heavier equipment safely under the seat or in the compartments above the seats during take-off and landing.
A persistent injury to the ankle threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga away game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg.
Mainz is asking for a use of Nicolai Müller.
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team.
So far, he has only been able to do this individually.
"We will decide on his stake in the short term," coach Thomas Tuchel said.
The 40-year-old hopes to have his top scorer with him with him with him.
Mainz already have to do without the injured performers Niki Zimling, Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert.

The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and color strokes will be presented by the Kreisverbandsleistungsschau this weekend in the Bürgerhaus.
The assessments were already made on Thursday
Once again, the local association W514 is hosting this large exhibition.
Breeders of the associations in the district of Soest show their best animals as well as young Wicked hobby owners their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges evaluated the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the show will be well informed, as the assessment of all animals is attached to the cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be performed by Mayor Hermann Arndt Saturday at 2.30 p.m.
The rabbit show on Saturday is open to all visitors from 10 a.m. and on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., which will be followed by the award ceremony.
The guests are also invited to a tombola equipped with stately prizes and to a deliciously stocked cafeteria.
Seriously injured after clash
Early on Friday afternoon, two motorists were seriously injured in a head-on collision on the state road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but could initially say little about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that should first be evaluated.
What is certain is that the 19-year-old driver of a VW Golf drove in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to meet her with his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so heavily trapped that firefighters took just under half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreckage.
The actual cause of the accident remained unexplained at first.
Both victims came to nearby hospitals.
The track remained fully closed for about two hours.
British police send Assange an extradition notice
British police today handed over an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge and applied for asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had sent the 40-year-old Australian a "call to stand up" to call him to appear in a police station, adding that if he did not comply, he was threatened with arrest.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden over the charge in a sexual offence after his options have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the US, he had on 19. June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London sought refuge and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard had "sent a 40-year-old man a request to stand at a police station at a time we have chosen," a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy made no comment on the delivery of the police request.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there on possible espionage allegations after posting over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Revolutionary work of church music
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary, the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which thrilled the audience in the spring of this year, the Liederkranz will enrich two services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year.
On Saturday, 26. October, this extraordinary fair from 19 onwards will be held during the evening mass in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday, 27. October, from 10.15 a.m. at the service in St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf can be heard.
The so-called German Mass with the original title "Gesänge zur Feier des Heiligen Opfer der Messe", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost considered revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is performed as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had it in mind.
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider, the choir is accompanied by the brass band of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ.
Scientists were able to shed more light on the connection between a dog's tail-wagging and mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs wagged their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
Yet now scientists are saying that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: "In humans, it is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the brain react differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right hemisphere of the brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail wagging of their conspecifics, the researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the four-legged friends and analyzed the behavior.
We will probably soon understand why the cock moves in one direction, sometimes in the other
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs films with dogs - either a lifelike version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects, and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right."
When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move the tail to the right (seen from the perspective of the wagging dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the tail inclination was primarily to the left (again from the perspective of the dog that wags), so their heart rate rose and they looked restless.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should be worried about and when not.
He said: "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wagging is linked to the tail in one direction rather with friendly behavior and the right side rather produces a less friendly behavior, then you react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say the findings could help dog owners, vets and trainers to better understand their animal's emotions.
John Bradshaw, an expert in dog behavior and visiting fellow at the Faculty of Veterinology at the University of Bristol, said this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it is a contented dog.
In another research paper at the University of Victoria in Canada, the following was: “Dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when his ‘tail’ is wagging on the left and not right instead of becoming restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study.”
According to his statement, the differences could be due to the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help, he explained.
“Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception,” Bradshaw said.
However, since their behavior can be easily recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes in the other.
Tony Blair declared he would take the chance to return as British prime minister - but acknowledged that a comeback was unlikely.
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues.
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as envoy of the Quartet of Peacemakers in the Middle East.
Asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that this will happen, so ..."
Apartment fire in Helmbrechts: Rescue workers recover charred body
The fire department had to move out late Thursday night in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches fire in the night to Friday.
Rescuers recover a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers have found a charred body in a three-family home in a fire in Helmbrechts.
Whether it was a resident is still unclear, as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said.
By late Thursday night, it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When firefighters arrived, the flames were already pounding out of a window.
The emergency services went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room burned out completely.
The entire ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not at home during the fire, the police spokesman said.
The building is no longer habitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Constance: Cyclist drives 63-year-old around
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening, around 22 o'clock, with a ladies' bike illegally on the left sidewalk from the station square in the direction of the market place.
When suddenly a 63-year-old man stepped onto the sidewalk from a restaurant, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, according to police.
In the following collision, the pedestrian was pushed against the house wall, went to the ground in the further course and contracted a 15 centimeter long laceration to the head.
An ambulance team took the injured person to the hospital for medical treatment.
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to illness of Alex Turners

UN announces new targets for poverty reduction
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a number of new goals to replace the Millennium Development Goals for the fight against poverty, which were announced twelve years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in the push for "sustainable development goals" to replace the Millennium Goals that expired in 2015.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world political leaders, including Ms Gillard, at the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to "think beyond national interests."
"I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to be agreed with universal, sustainable development goals," he said.
“These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states in order to realize our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals."
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart
Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of the Greens, has now also intervened in the ongoing discussions about the future of music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education in the Musikhochschule Stuttgart," Özdemir told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper.
Jazz and classical music are just part of the jazz location in Stuttgart.
This contradicts Özdemir, who in Stuttgart as the favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22. September is valid, the Green-Red state government.
On the basis of an expert study, this is pushing for a reorganization of the five music academies in Baden-Württemberg.
Among other things, the Jazz and Pop degree program will be relocated from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim.
Pawnshops are booming in Singapore as the crisis has arrived in the middle class
In a pawn shop at the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, Janani Amirthalinga trades a golden bangle, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters' school fees.
“My husband and I just bought a house, there’s all my money in it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) every month as an administrative employee and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax, where it made its exchange, became the third pawn shop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledging jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 percent, which is just above the 15.4 percent that United Overseas Bank is demanding, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnshops offer the advantage that no creditworthiness or proof of income is required here, which is why loans are possible faster than with banks.
This is why millions of people in the region turn to pawnshops after families feel the pressure from rising living costs, as well as increasing household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economic areas, families with lower and middle incomes seek out pawn shops to make up for the difference in the event of a stuttering economy.
This week, rating agency Standard & Poor's grew household debt, mostly due to rising mortgages, described as a risk factor for the credit rating of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in relation to gross domestic product, according to the agency.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, a 60 percent increase still in 2008.
Economists are also worried about Thailand's high consumer debt, which narrowly emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued existing export weakness and a slackening in consumer demand.
“In the end, in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower segment (the income scale) will try to supplement their income wherever possible,” says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historic highs in gold prices over the past two years have further heightened the trend towards pledging personal belongings, as people take the opportunity to turn the family's jewellery into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city-state's 200 pawn stores are gold.
People say to themselves, “The price of gold looks good, let’s pledge grandmother’s gold chain and bring it back next month.”
Thailand's largest pawn shop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers in its stores in recent months.
The growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax, operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only into neighboring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, Managing Director of ValueMax.
The company is funding that with 60 percent of the $66 million it took in this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire because of high interest rates, Yeah explains that pawn shops not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders, but also did not directly increase debt.
"Customers borrow items they already own, and liquefying personal valuables does not increase household schooling," she explains.
The pawnshop business is increasingly accepted as short-term, hedged financing.
Also, not all people who use pawnshops are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Customers from every social class come to us.
“This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses that need to bridge bottlenecks in cash flow,” says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Rangnick scolding for Schiris: Mane not a swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga leader Red Bull Salzburg, the sporting director of the "Bulls" was so disappointed by the referees.
"There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Swallow Kings category," he took the two offensive whirlwinds into protection at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
The most recent occasion for Rangnick's criticism was yellow for Mane in the 3:0 against Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese became an alleged acting to the doom - which was certainly none, as the TV pictures showed.
"A gross wrong decision," said Rangnick, who described referee Harkam as "completely overwhelmed."
Harkam would also have contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot in a decided manner: "I would have behaved the same as Roger Schmidt in every single situation".
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was insulted," the 46-year-old insisted.
Given the run of success, however, Rangnick voiced a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: Really good," he said.
There's not much to expose.
The way the team plays in particular is impressive.
I want this to continue.
There will be hardly any changes in the winter transfer period.
There are no great reasons to change anything.
"Except for a player comes up with the wish that he wants to leave the club," Rangnick said.
A study has been announced by the UK government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
In the work of HS2 Ltd, it is proposed to establish high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England as early as Phase 1 began in 2026.
Transport Secretary Baroness Kramer said the project "will bring Britain closer together."
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the UK Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail service between London and the West Midlands.
After completion of Phase 2, there will be links to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and northern England of 32.7 billion. Pounds to 42.6 billion Pounds.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together."
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings tremendous benefits.
Without it, we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
Yet it is also about the link between 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is being improved thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to campaign "unequivocally" for Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Brown said: "The high-speed rail link holds the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time Scotland's economic power is also providing an argument for fast rail links across the UK."
That is why we are delighted to work as a partner of the UK Government and explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will create benefits for everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh connection, which the Scottish Government is already planning.
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the UK ministers next year and to decide the next steps together.
Living with a future perspective
Actually, Waltraud Ries lives dreamlike.
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of greenery, an old tree population, nice neighbors and also not too much traffic.
The city is only a few minutes by public transport.
"You're hopefully not afraid of spiders?" asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not a spider phobia, but the worry of not being able to cope with the many stairs to the house and in the apartment in old age, she explains.
In addition, since a meniscus operation, the mid-fifty woman has had to experience what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, a book by her on the topic 'Happy living in old age - Which form of living is the best for me?'.
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn't work in old age,' she begins to tell.
When she moved into the duplex apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the countryside.
Today at the age of fifty, Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the topic of 'living in old age'.
Most crowd it out as long as it goes.
Old only the others always get,' she says, chuckling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great, one worries.
"But then it may already be too late," says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 housing models for self-determined living in old age.
"What type of living you choose, however, is always an individual decision," she explains.
D i e solution does not exist for age.
Even those who can afford the retirement home in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the national language, you also join in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist author says to the settlement-seekers.
Among their models are classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner flat.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and quirks
"For me, such a shared flat would be nothing," she says with a wink.
Certainly not like in a student shared flat with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
"In old age, you just need your retreats," says Ries.
However, the book author does not want to rule out the possibility that a senior citizens’ community can still work.
However, this must be different than in the classic student shared flat.
And sometimes you just want your peace," she believes.
With this opinion, at least in the state capital, she is not alone.
"Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible," is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the head of the Bürgerservices Leben im Alter der Landeshauptstadt.
Your department advises people around the topic of 'getting older'.
Therefore, especially older people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions, only to be able to stay in their familiar environment, this is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest.
Today, there are many possibilities to make the house or apartment barrier-free.
Ries recommends that all those who deal with the age-appropriate conversion of their house or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly and not to commission the first craftsman.
Today, there are also specialists for age-appropriate conversion.
Even in the rental apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it is only the toilet seat increase, the interior designer enlightens.
But the existing apartment can not always be redesigned according to age and thus barrier-free, even if it is still so beautiful.
Waltraud Ries had to have this experience.
Although you could install a stairlift inside the apartment, the path paved with stairs to the apartment door would be the far bigger obstacle.
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband.
Before moving, she is more afraid than in front of the spider at her apartment door.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
The intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a fundamental interest in helping Germany solve the increasingly explosive NSA spy affair.
According to the Greens member of parliament Hans-Christian Ströbele, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the ex-intelligence employee would testify to a German public prosecutor or before a committee of inquiry.
Snowden had referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told the ARD magazine "Panorama".
Motorist seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old car driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
According to the police, a 41-year-old from Müsch was at about 21.15 clock with her car on the Kempen outer ring in the direction of Grefrath.
As the left on the St. Töniser Straße wanted to turn, she overlooked the oncoming car of the 37-year-old.
The vehicle collided.
The Aachen man suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to hospital for treatment.
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association league after six match days.
Right now it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to the derby against the TSV Daverden, who celebrated his first victory last weekend.
With this game, the season starts afresh for us.
"I hope that we finally have our head free," says Ehlers cautiously optimistic.
With the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme, he finally has his entire squad at his disposal.
Daverden, like us, is also betting on pace play.
Therefore, we need to keep our error rate low.
First and foremost, however, it is important to increase in coverage, which has recently left anything but a sure impression.
Daverden's coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first win of the season against Nordhorn.
The game was, of course, a house number.
But that's why we're far from the favorite, because anything can always happen in the Derby.
Nevertheless, Panitz now wants to follow up in Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte Jodat will be missing.
For this, the A-youth Joost Windßuß, who is active with double playing rights at the A-Youth Bundesliga club HC Bremen, makes his season debut.
If you are not hot in such a game, you should stay at home.
Cocaine addict lawyer who warned drug lord of police investigation must go to jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, passed on information to underworld great Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyer who warned a drug lord of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be uncovered was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld great Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his activities in the drug trade after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The lawyer nicknamed "Bash" by criminalists was arrested at his home in 2011 after police supervised Scarborough, whom he had represented in a previous drug trial.
Officials watched as Scarborough (32) delivered three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while the latter was with colleagues at a bar's dinner.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards during tests.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were monitored by police at the time as part of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Together with 32 other people, they were later arrested after police secured heroin and cocaine worth £1.5 million, as well as £200,000 in cash, during a series of house searches.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool's Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to cocaine possession during a previous questioning.
The lawyer was convicted after police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigating officers followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs there with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's garbage can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, picked up the drugs and then nine notices were exchanged between the two.
In court, it was revealed that Ditta was a "regular consumer" of cocaine after Class A drugs were discovered in his hair, wallet and credit cards during tests.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied taking cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client, claiming that her discussion was subject to the "lawyer's secret."
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he was running an office at his home address as well as at the workplace and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
In court, it was revealed that he had called key drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, after significant arrests and informed of what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you don't break the law."
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defense lawyer, as he has engaged too much with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker, but a drug trafficker who provides his lawyer with drugs.
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate, for he was the lawyer of these individuals.
Yet that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He counteracted the police investigation as much as possible, so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta thus brought his profession into disrepute.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing, claiming, “If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I’m not, and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough, I wouldn’t wait 15 hours, but do so immediately.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: "Mr. Ditta took the step from a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal the moment he started to acquire drugs from organised criminals."
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public.
Ditta has betrayed that confidence and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also led to a conviction in three counts of possession of cocaine and obstruction, underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape the arm of the law.
We'll find you and take you to court.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to use heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself, in which he stated that his dream job was to represent clients on death row in America as a lawyer, his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work.
Until now, the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
The officers were only called twice to egg-throwing children, who threw them against house facades.
Since the homeowners recognized this in time and removed the egg residues immediately, no property damage should have occurred.
Furthermore, some New Year's Eve firecrackers were probably also ignited in the urban area, but also here no property damage has been incurred.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with toilet paper and his wheel trims were stolen.
Until the arrival of the police, however, the man has found his wheel trims in the immediate vicinity, which is why the police did not have to continue to act.
A day of thanks at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165. Foundation festival to which the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, had come gladly.
In the club premises of the restaurant "Witteborg" in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious togetherness in the sign of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Festival is always the right festivity to make honors.
This time, secretary Rolf Wagener was delighted with the special award "Singer of the Year".
"Not only did you write a lot for us, but you also did a lot of things for us, but you have our heartfelt thank you," said the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choir rehearsals by means of activity bouquets went this year to the choir director Dieter Schulze with 44 participations, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 participations each.
Note warden Artur Brückner finished fifth.
The board of directors addressed a special thank you to the team of club host Ange Pier-Ribbert, who had once again conjured a first-class menu and Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choir rehearsals every Tuesday at 19.45 clock in the club premises.
"New singing-loving voices are always welcome," says Schlotmann.
Council targets track facilities
Should the "Am Hirschen" level crossing be extensively rebuilt in order to increase road safety?
Yes, the local councils have decided.
Schiltach has to take 220 000 euros in hand for this.
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
In particular, the safety at level crossings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the reconstruction measures, they have to contribute a third of the costs, the rest share the railway and the federal government.
Schiltach's city builder Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipal council the special features of the "Am Hirschen" level crossing.
There, the city plans to build a bulge at the level of the tunnel mouth west of the railway tracks.
There, larger vehicles, for example those that transport longwood, could also be in oncoming traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed to construct a required retaining wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the local council, as some councils questioned the need for road distribution: Thomas Kipp summed up the mood of the critics with his statement: "Do we have to take so much money in hand because of so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed: The level crossing "Hirschen" is regularly used for longwood transports.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" area is partly transported over this route, because the vehicles, which are up to 20 meters long, could not use the route at the Häberles Bridge, because they could not turn into the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles that are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is closed, Haas argued.
Since it should be foreseen that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and renovated, as is currently the case in Wolfach, the level crossing "Am "Hirschen" could also be given an important traffic significance for a longer period of time.
Councils agreed to have the costs of the planned widening of the road would be investigated.
Despite this, the majority of the conversion of the level crossing was approved with the proviso that the required retaining wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road in the direction of "Bahnhofstraße" for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters.
The conversion of the level crossing at the Trautwein tannery, on the other hand, could pose a completely different problem, which concerns the access road to the sharply rising "Geroltzhäuser Weg".
The administration had the conversion plans of the railway examined by the engineering office Breinlinger, since it had doubts whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was then still possible without further ado.
The investigation concluded that it could not be ruled out that the inclination ratios of the road could lead to longer vehicles being sitting on.
The city, in turn, bears the responsibility for this as a road construction load carrier.
The restructuring could therefore result in liability disputes.
Since both the wood removal and the turning worked in the current state of expansion, one should not agree to the conversion of the level crossing, argued Haas.
At this point, too, the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle standing on the transition is significantly lower than at the other level crossings, because directly next to it is the stop point center, to which there is a good visual connection.
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point to such an extent that no collision threatens.
The majority of the conversion of this level crossing was refused approval, since the city of Schiltach would have to "bathe out" the problem with sitting vehicles, according to the councils, since the railway could withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work.
The panel considers the conversions at the level crossings "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" as unproblematic, for which crossing agreements with the railway have already been made.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller calls pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, the Gazprom board said.
“Today’s event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun,” Gazprom’s chief executive Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element for the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is said to be more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine, in which the bulk of Russian gas is stored for Europe, is causing an increased risk in conventional routes, as can be heard from the official side.
Miller said the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were "forever" eliminated.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted tariffs when the entire 2015 project goes into operation.
According to Gazprom, construction work in other subordinate countries is scheduled to begin on the planned route at the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Vienna Airport abolishes passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
Announcements like this will no longer exist at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future.
A large part of the loudspeaker announcements are thus eliminated - the noise level is to be significantly lowered.
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation.
Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, Vienna Airport is following an international trend with the cessation of announcements affecting individual persons.
Among other things, the airports in Copenhagen, Frankfurt or Dubai are already forgoing the noisy appeals.
Due to the elimination of these announcements - on average, around 200 personal calls are heard through the loudspeakers in one day - it should be quieter in the future at the airport.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information about changed flying or departure times are a bit lost here," Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Ben Greenman: Ten Years of New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
You could say that New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Almost a hundred years ago, the variant artist Frank Fay, who worked as a conférencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell the crowd directly jokes in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fay's innovation has been expanded, as recently as the New York Comedy Festival.
Launched and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of Caroline’s stand-up institution, the festival celebrates its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners started at Carolines and then became more and more successful until they were eventually too well-known to perform in a club," Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we can keep working with them.
This year’s event will feature performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, which features Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby, among others.
With the festival, the world of comedy has also grown.
A number of the comedians taking part in the festival this year have become known through rather unconventional ways, such as broadcasts on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known with a sitcom on cable television (the ironic-slippery fantasy football series "The League" on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast on both "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation," although she's best known for her viral video series "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On."
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, focused on racial issues W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the festival's biggest visitor magnets is an interview: David Steinberg talks to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian but has grown into a respected television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks through the alleyway between two buildings and thinks to himself: Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here.
On the last weekend of August, the Black Forest Open-Air Museum Vogtsbauernhof in Gutach near Hornberg is once again firmly in children’s hands.
Traditionally, the museum is called visitors on Saturday and Sunday, 24th and 25th. August, as part of the summer holiday program for a colorful children's and family festival with numerous hands-on activities and events welcome.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days," the press release said.
Whether making soap, turning candles, felting or making ropes, the right thing is for every age.
Regional craftsmen are assisting the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum workshop is also being worked on.
When building cuckoo whistles, water wheels or gyroscopes, the young guests can prove their craftsmanship.
The many old games, such as wheelbarrow races or stilt running, also promise a lot of fun.
Speed and coordination are required here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a puzzle tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday, at 12 and 14 o'clock.
On a terrain tour, the children have to guess which stories correspond to the truth or are a lie.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with Black Forest foxes.
Not only horses, but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows and chickens can be found and admired on the site.
In addition, all children can look forward to the Clown Otsch on Sunday, who drives his scraper snack from 11 a.m. with the museum guests.
Meanwhile, Hermann Büttner is cosy and fairy-tale-like.
The storyteller takes the little guests at 11, 13 and 15 o'clock into the wonderful world of fairy tales.
In addition, the children's costume dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
Furthermore, on both days of the event from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom tie, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be looked over the shoulder in their traditional work.
Until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg, visitors to the open-air museum can expect a varied holiday programme.
Networking of universities and companies important
On his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald, state parliament president Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow comes from.
In the support centre Hochschwarzwald, together with the managing directors of the vocational schools as well as the district high school and the chairpersons of the parent advisory board, he investigated this important question.
"Education is an important location factor," emphasized Claudia Stehle, director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule, which presented the networked school project Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training.
Since 2011, a successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum, the district high school and the vocational school centre has existed in the Waldstadt.
He also praised the family friendliness in the county.
"It is important not only to keep an eye on the family phase, but also the phase around the care of relatives due to the demographic change," Wolf explained.
In addition, he stated that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to a termination of the employment relationship," Wolf said.
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers, he said.
Another, particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often remain with their acquired knowledge and skills of the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," said the president of the state parliament.
Because only if sufficient training places are offered, the need for skilled workers can also be met.
In his opinion, the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany, in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland.
In addition, on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg, he experienced the efforts already made for the expansion of public transport.
"Remain persistent and make sure that public transport gets better," he explained to the address of the local politicians present.
Australian woman appeals jail sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first issued by a provincial court in Phuket on 15. June found guilty of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver had her in the morning hours on Sunday, the 10th. June, raped while two other men detained her.
Later, however, footage from a video camera showed she had safely arrived at her hotel after she was separated from her Australian boyfriend.
Police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she confessed to making up the story.
Until the court hearing, she was in police custody on the spot.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention facility on the outskirts of Phuket, rather than in a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former player of the Australian Rubgy League, who has reached out to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We're very worried, of course, but we hope she'll be home as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the ruling and is on the loose on a 50,000 bail.
Australian reports said that she is on holiday in the holiday resort of Krabi in southern Thailand.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand could try to improve its ailing tourist image after the recent murder of the travel clerk Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore an acquittal.
Painted the construction fence on the Bechtle property
A group of the citizens' initiative "Schweizer Wiese" has beautified the construction fence on the Bechtle property on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, it cleaned and widened the footpath, according to a press release.
The planned covering of the decaying house in the back of the property had not been allowed for safety reasons, because the site threatens to slip.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed the beautification campaign with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
Before the action of the BI, a banner with the message "We are for it" had been attached.
However, this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens’ initiative in their action.
Their motto on the large poster was "We are against building ruins".
With this, she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins in the Swiss meadow - should the giant project one day fail.
In conversation with many passers-by in front of the "construction site" it became clear that some citizens believe that the realization of the city's project will make many better, although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI.
But they are starting to resign because the city is further delaying those responses, the BI says.
As you can hear, the mayor's public statements also affect.
May had said in the municipal council meeting that he feared the end for the thermal bath, should the population vote in the citizens' decision against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow.
Some therefore appear almost terrified, others perceive it as a "plump blackmail attempt" on the population, according to the press release of the BI.
The BI thanked the donors for the colour and all the helpers.
Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons, according to a surveillance group
Syria has destroyed key chemical weapons manufacturing facilities and poison gas ammunition, the global chemical weapons monitoring group said on Thursday, while in the north of the country there were heavy clashes near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the beginning of the civil war almost three years ago.
The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) announced a day before the appointment at
1. November, which the Hague-based organization Damascus had set to destroy or make "inoperable" all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all of Syria’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus has yet to begin destroying the existing weapons and supplies.
According to assumptions, there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve gas sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts say has a chemical weapons production facility and deposits here, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which is tracking the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the part of the government, 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On the 25th In July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict at 100,000 since March 2011.
This number has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's troops have been fighting for weeks in Safira against the rebels, many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there had been losses on both sides on Thursday, but did not give details.
The fighting underscores the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, the team is “now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing/filling facilities mentioned by Syria and witnessed their destruction.”
Therefore, "no further inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier in the week, inspectors had said they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus.
Because of safety concerns, the visit of two facilities had not been possible, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC said the two sites had been abandoned, according to the Syrian statement, "and the objects of the chemical weapons program existing there have been relocated to other named facilities that have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has put forward a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC's executive committee next month.
"I take the hat off to the bravery and courage you all showed in completing the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organization," Ahmed Uzumcu, the monitoring organization's director general, said in a commentary published by OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting a secession of Shiite Islam in this civil war against Assad’s government and their security forces, to which many members of the Alawites belong.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there had been a powerful explosion at an air defense facility in Syria's coastal province of Latakia on Wednesday.
The cause of the explosion was not known, he said.
RBS suspends two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, according to two people familiar with the situation; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed they are working with authorities on the investigations in the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion changes hands every day.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the widening investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business entails.
The bank, which made no comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
"Our investigation into this issue continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people close to the situation indicated that the RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent to and from a previous trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left the RBS in 2010 and is said to have been on leave of absence from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rouhan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was on leave this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended at Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
Usher's Instant Message group included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market at a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities, people familiar with the situation said.
Banks are combing through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been among the most profitable of trading units of investment banks in recent years, but has been under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair, saying that it is nearly impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks mean that “you can influence the market even with very low ticket prices”.
The news came out the same day Credit Suisse announced it had terminated a trader from its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after causing a loss of just under six million dollars at the end of last year.
The bank promptly informed the relevant authorities and cooperates with them.
"We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained," Credit Suisse said.
Coulson put in to use phone hacking for checking a tip
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" in an attempt to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper instructed private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack and pursue Pawlby's voicemails, but Coulson also called them and left messages, the court learned.
“In the opinion of the prosecutor’s office, Coulson, who is now the editor of the NotW, is no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to catch it in the act, but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction,” Edis explained.
He said NotW uses three procedures to research stories in an investigative manner: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second, the surveillance, it can't be otherwise.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies this, but we say, “And if he knew about it.”
Rumours of Clarke's affair were first picked up by NotW's feature editorial board when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's dating Charles."
A tape of voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the detective's computer, on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects."
By the time the searches were ongoing, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw Pawlby's moves.
On 18. June 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to publish tomorrow that I’d like to talk to Charles about.”
Edis explained that Coulson’s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett over an affair with a married woman when he himself was in a relationship with co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who had been married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny having conspired with others, between the 3rd. October 2000 and the 9th August 2006 to hack phones.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking.
Early puberty: growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers, as research shows.
Physical changes do not yet directly mean puberty
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced among boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and pubic hair at the age of seven or eight?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and represented a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time calming parents down - usually this is not an indication that puberty is now fast," explained Kaplowitz.
Obvious indications of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and armpit hair as well as body odor, are evident in girls earlier.
Nevertheless, there has been only a slight shift in the age of the menarche (occurrence of the first menstrual period) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly less than 12.75 in 1970.
"When the development of the breasts begins, it will take at least two to three years to menarche," said Kaplowitz, also author of the book "Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with this Common Problem."
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is "early" if breast augmentation is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight years.
In most cases, the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor.
With faster progress, tests by an endicronologist could be indicated so that serious problems such as tumors or cysts can be ruled out.
There are treatment methods for delaying early menstruation and defending against another consequence: premature aging of the bones, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
The recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the speed of development, the growth rate and the emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about medication, but he admits: “The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls, unlike being their peers.”
The other big problem is understandable: parents just don't want their very young daughters to have the period.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls a woman whose daughter got her days at ten.
Even though there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came home frightened and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no conclusive evidence that hormones are causative in milk or other food, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media.
Boys, like girls, come to puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity.
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years, which establishes a link between body fat and entering puberty.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that have played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers.
There are different explanations for this.
Globally, early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things, from economic conditions to the climate to the genes.
Another mystery: Although boys’ facial and pubic hair is growing earlier, the trend towards full-scale earlier puberty is not as pronounced as it is in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference underscored the complexity of the issue.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common even among babies and young children.
"We need to be careful about how to identify the true beginning of puberty," Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek advice from their pediatrician on how to talk to their child.
"This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected," Kaplowitz advised.
When you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who blossom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it enters earlier than thought.
Illmensee: Second mountain bike race inspires participants
In wonderful weather, 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the circuit over the hills around the lake.
This is announced by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee.
Among the participants were, especially on the short distance over 15 kilometers and 300 meters of altitude, numerous everyone cyclists who wanted to practice their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior riders of the top German class were also at the start in this competition: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good rankings at the German Championships.
These two were able to settle off from the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader was able to save a small time advantage to the finish and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance.
Pascal Treubel was once again able to place in second place.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli from Team Nightraum who made it to the top of the podium.
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Treiber from Owingen came in second and third place.
A pleasing development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community.
Not only in terms of performance, the whole range of athletes was represented.
The age structure also ranged from ten years for the youngest to more than 70 years with the oldest starters.
In the main race this year, even more absolute top athletes were at the start.
Four drivers were able to set themselves apart from the top regional drivers.
Among them Philipp Pangerl, a mountain bike semi-pro from the Black Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl, together with a teammate, has twice been world champion in twelve-hour driving.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
With Roland Ballerstedt, who already owns two German championship titles in duathlon.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, there was an eyelash final in the finish line in front of the three-lake hall.
Pangerl was the first to race across the finish line.
Only one second behind, the veteran Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann finished third in the overall standings.
In the women's standings, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
Second place was secured by Arene Blersch from Binzwangen ahead of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized course of the event.
Israeli warplanes attack target in Syria, according to official sources
Israeli fighter aircraft attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target had been, but said it had been at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile shipments in Syria.
Before the turf derby against Schalke, travelling BVB supporters with light rockets had caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences.
Before Friday's match of the Bundesliga against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with a silence - initially.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustics, which offered itself to the viewer until just before the kick-off of the Bundesliga match between the German runner-up Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna Park.
Mostly the guest fans with their chants were heard.
The southern grandstand, on the other hand, where the most loyal of the loyal - and loudest - BVB fans stand, initially presented itself exceptionally quietly: no chants, no battle cries.
The pedestal of the Capo, which otherwise coordinates the joint cheer, remained unoccupied.
And at the very front of the grandstand, a large flag with the inscription "Section Stadionverbot" was blowing alone.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, was the first BVB player to enter the pitch, briefly cheers burned up.
When his team-mates followed, there was loud singing and waving scarves - but not everywhere.
Nothing moved in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern grandstand.
Even that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, victory over Arsenal, contract extension of coach Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a celebration mood.
Only five minutes before kick-off did the Capo climb its podium - and the tension that had been grabby with hands unloaded in a loud cry when Dickel, as usual, queried the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Last, as always, was the southern grandstand's turn - and finally, as usual, was the loudest place in the stadium here again.
And at the latest when the loud prompt "Derby winner stands up" came with kick-off from the southern grandstand, everything was as always.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Immediately before the Revierderby at FC Schalke 04, some of the BVB supporters had fired light rockets into the spectator ranks and on the pitch - and almost scored goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was kicked off late because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tops of the Dortmund ultras in his office - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fan representatives.
"There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement," the BVB boss announced at a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday night.
As an immediate measure, Watzke prohibited the Ultras from a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I banned that," he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy in terms of pyrotechnics.
In addition, the ultras were shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday, they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, according to Watzke, the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be incisive," Watzke assured.
One can be curious to see how the reactions in the southern grandstand will turn out.
What happens to my email on the way?
Email is actually an electronic letter.
Was the draft of the Internet service e-mail technically implemented the letter secret similar to the conventional post office?
When designing the early Internet services, the focus was on making communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols did not make sure to create a stable foundation for a hearing-proof exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter.
If user "Anna" sends an email to "Benni", are the computers of the two directly connected?
In the first step, Anna’s e-mail program or browser sends the email to the mail server of your service provider.
For example, if she has a GMail account, that would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses.
On the route, the mail can run on several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the content at his provider.
Are conventional emails read along the way through the net?
Most mails are read several times on the go by software robots.
The provider of the sender is usually checked whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment.
A virus check is also carried out on the recipient systems.
In addition, the providers check whether it is a nuisance and unwanted spam mail, which is immediately deleted or at least sorted away into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another task?
For systems such as GMail, the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising.
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip, Google can display corresponding links to holiday offers.
Do unknown people also read the emails?
The probability of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
In theory, however, this is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the option of reading electronic mail.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal options to intercept or take note of emails.
In addition, there are possible illegal spying actions.
Is it possible to protect emails against reading?
With encryption according to the OpenPGP standard, an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an e-mail communication, so that it is not even possible to easily identify who has communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the email market in Germany?
In the mainly privately used mailboxes, Yahoo and Google play only a minor role, according to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013.
While Yahoo-Mail's shares had fallen recently, GMail was able to grow significantly from Google.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of pastor.
The background is a possible shortage of pastors: The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors will halve by 2030 according to the current situation.
For young people of today, the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow and daily routine yourself.
With burfia, the state church has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full site to inspire young people to study theology.
At the moment, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien attributes this to the process of de-ecclesiasm: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The profession is characterized by great freedom and diversity.
I am master of my schedule and can set my priorities where it is important to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as pastors.
They earned as much as teachers and could live well off it.
Certainly, more is paid in the free economy, but theologians would have a safe employer for this.
This is what you come to meet the young people of today, who are not just about careers, but about a meaningful work.
According to the state church, which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony, around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology degree begin their vicariate.
In the sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Wendland, it could be difficult to fill positions in the future.
Among other things, Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite celebrities who have studied theology.
Theology studies offer a broad education.
You can even become president of the German Federal.
Royal Commission hearing: Two YMCA staff charged over allegations of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales (NSW) had been charged with sexual offences related to children before allegations were made against child caretaker Jonathan Lord from Caringbah in 2011, the Royal Commission for Child Sexual Abuse Learned.
However, in the opening statement before the Commission, the YMCA had said that “it had never had to deal with an incident of child sexual abuse in the organization.”
Managing director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography offences, and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall had been convicted of abusing children entrusted to him in 1991.
Hare said Gail Furness, a commission's assistant lawyer, said he had known about the first case but did not know the second.
He acknowledged that the YMCA's opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that "there have been external reviews of the YMCA, in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety."
Evidence before the Commission rather shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, acknowledged that the management had failed "from me down" in hiring Lord and failed to ensure that employees had been aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord had been convicted earlier this year of sex offences against twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare denied, however, that the YMCA had a cultural issue that had prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations regarding child safety.
Staff testified that they had observed violations, among other things, that Lord was alone with children, privately looked after them as a babysitter, let them sit on his lap, said to one that he loved it, and let children play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose superior was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the superior of Lords at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and very unapproachable most of the time."
The managing director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not dared to report to their superiors.
Instead, he said, rather, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, which is why they had not reported him.
Hare said he had told the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson the organization had to draw from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "not about reporting" by employees, and the board had agreed to it.
Hare said the decision to push employees to sign nonsecration commitments shortly after the allegations were made by the executive director of the YMCA's children's services, Liam Whitley.
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence, but this was "overzealous" and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW had not been an organization safe for children during the period when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert in child sexual abuse, explained to the commission.
He explained that there had been "serious problems" in hiring, reviewing, training and supervising employees.
The hearing was up to 20. December adjourned.
Tourism: Descent to the Romans
At a length of around 120 metres, a sewer from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne.
If you visit Cologne, you will not be able to avoid the cathedral.
Around 157 metres, the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe.
But only a few visitors who marvel at the two filigree church towers suspect that there is also a lot to discover under the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for its guided tours is the Cologne-Tourismus Service Center directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite unspectacularly: "We start in the underground car park," says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a city suitable for the car, and therefore of the remains of the old city wall, only what was not too big remained.
Most users of the parking garage therefore rush past the Roman remains today and only park their car.
But if you take a closer look, you will discover an archaeological site separated by metal grids in the parking deck D2.
You can see about five meters high ruins of palm-sized stones.
"It's remnants of the Roman city wall that was built in the second half of the first century AD," Schulze recounts.
Before it goes back to light, Schulze lets the participants take a look at the upper parking level in a dark, 15-meter-deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old cathedral, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the praetorium, and here the participants descend into the depths again.
We are witnessing here the official seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the preator of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which means in good German as much as "City of Roman law and city of the Agrippinensians, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the imperial cult".
And the Praetorium is the former governor's palace, the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the anteroom of the exhibition, a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewer, which is preserved here over a length of around 120 metres.
"You can walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want," Schulze cheers up the guests.
Schulze still has a surprise.
After pulling the key at the cash register, he leads the group to a 16-metre-deep, walk-in shaft.
"We are now in the mikvah, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for the ritual ablutions.
To this day, in the lower end of the Mikveh, whose origins date back to the eighth century, different water levels can be read by changing levels of the Rhine.
The mikvah will become part of an archaeological zone on City Hall Square, for which construction work is scheduled to begin shortly.
However, a few more years will pass before completion.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior includes racing seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support for bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally customers who come to bowler have changed.”
They are not all experienced racers, but people who are looking for excitement and adventure, as well as for an achievable way to world-class events.
We are delighted to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the rigours and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will have a training and testing day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
George Kerevan: European unbundling gives the Scots the choice
A new day, a new horror story for independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership.
That provides the keyword for stories about passport checks in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
In fact, the Strathclyde template pointed out the possible economic benefits that more freedom of travel would bring in the rest of Europe, but this did not matter – as expected – in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued non-observance for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what you really want from the Scots.
Not really a story.
And one that has come in such a year that it already resembles a fossil: For the first time I heard the "independence means passport control" duck at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history.
Why should you expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European whistle?
Why trade the London yoke for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled.
With the euro crisis, the Europe project has officially died.
All over the EU, parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro overboard as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the federal election in September and thus effectively drive the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) out of the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point.
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket, into which the respective national economy is forced by sticking to the common currency, many people are of the view that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has nailed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave it that way.
Without the possibility of a devaluation of the local currency, southern Europe finds itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage against Germany.
The only option is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin.
Behind the current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem.
As a result of the "green" energy directives prescribed by Brussels - a code for the subsidisation of French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers - European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States.
That's a crippling cost disadvantage, as we've already seen in Grangemouth.
All of the world's wage fixings do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being cornered by cheap American shale gas.
As a result, a revolt is coming up, especially in France, the EU's former cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in check and Paris lifted on par with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy on Europe, which is the struggling French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, EU-hostile Front National has just won a decisive by-election, thus relegating the ruling Socialists to third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the electoral vote - a timely warning to Britain's Labour party that it can't assume a split on the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left.
What does Le Pen do with her newfound popularity among working-class white French?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to go beyond: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will become more like the "Europe of (sovereign) nations" that General de Gaulle favoured.
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flottering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scotland in all this?
We can choose to be a region of (in the final analysis) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to say to Berlin and Brussels what they can put somewhere.
I suspect Scotland could drive quite well in a looser European network, provided we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other similar-minded countries is easier in a non-federated Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should consider doing the same to Norway and retain our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed (and made) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition were responsible for.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now, only to then be forced on an austerity by Berlin and Brussels.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on airplanes (but don't make cell phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices for reading, working, playing, music and using watching movies from departure to landing, but not on the phone, according to the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the U.S. on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
How quickly they would be implemented depended on the respective airline, explained FAA employee Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the air staff training manuals and the arrangements for storing the equipment in accordance with the new regulations.
The FAA said it has already received plans from some airlines seeking to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among those airlines were Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers will have to shut down smartphones, tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed.
They may not take them off again until the aircraft has reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain gives the green light.
Upon entry into the landing approach, passengers must switch them off again and are not allowed to take off again before the aircraft has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the devices even on take-off, landing and on the runway, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted for the use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the professional association of professional flight attendants, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit,” Glading commented.
We are honestly tired of having to feel like watchers on this issue.
Nevertheless, Internet connections for surfing, exchanging e-mails, text messages or downloading data under three kilometers remained prohibited, the authority explained.
Passengers are being asked to put smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still not a "Words With Friends," the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he had to publicly leave a jet from American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stowed away, as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin.
Mobile phone calls during the flight also remain prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), not the FAA.
FAA may lift ban on certain electronic devices on take-off and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, safety expert on national traffic issues on CBS News, said cellphones would still be considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause interference with navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission towers,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, the pressure on the FAA to loosen restrictions on use has increased.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security reasons for the ban.
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the shutdown of the device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travelers in 1966 after reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment by passenger-carryed FM radios became known, which represented the latest technical trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA in such a way that they do not mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi to passengers for several years when the altitude is reached.
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic devices according to the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit significantly less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, only emit minimal radiation when flipping around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are stronger.
Amazon.com is one of the advocates for a relaxation of restrictions on device use by passengers.
In 2011, company employees loaded a passenger plane full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems, but were unable to detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk involved in using equipment.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Association of Airline Passengers, said he felt the disruption by the devices was genuine, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports from pilots who speak for a disruption of aircraft systems by the devices, and most of them were very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order the disconnection of the devices by the passengers when landing instruments in poor visibility.
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be extensively equipped with technology today.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, CEO of U.S. Travel Association.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear right at the beginning: The most important thing for the ham is the pig legs, turbomast is not a good prerequisite.
Can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
Uli, as head of the large ham factory in the Black Forest, explains to Jumbo how it works of the company "Adler" in Bonndorf.
"Germany's favourite ham," as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and coat he comes into the interior of the factory.
Jumbo must also disinfect his hands before he can reach for the microphone.
Jumbo spotted to strengthen at fast food in Waldshut
"I'm working here with huge quantities," marvel the television makers, Black Forest ham as a mass product.
16,000 clubs a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat content, color: Uli explains what is important in the quality.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
TV with level?
Details such as the Ph value of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm curious when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens next," said Jumbo.
This is where the level of private television is presented in pure culture.
But watching is still worth it.
The spectator sees that the disassembly of the clubs continues to be manual work.
Because: Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret of ham is the spice mixture with the salt.
Smoke tower and smoke firing are visually reminiscent of a "submarine" Jumbo.
The trick: fir branches provide the special taste of the Black Forest ham here in the smoke.
20 days in the smoke finally make the ham almost black.
"Now the disc in the jumbo is disappearing," he announces the test-eating.
"It's really delicious," the TV star concludes.
With that, everyone involved will be able to live.
Freudenstadt: Fast actions surprise hosts
With a narrow squad, the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb in the Schiller school gym in Reutlingen.
The Älbler were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
Soon, however, it became apparent that they could not quite keep up with the fast actions of the Freudenstadter, even due to age.
With the hard and placed serves, the Gönningers had an extremely difficult time.
Repeatedly, they missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly over the middle of the net and were not on hand at the block defense.
Two high first set wins clearly expressed the superiority of the Freudenstadter in all respects.
In view of this crushing and game-defining performance, the third set was then won somewhat lax and listless to the 3:0 final score (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).
There will be on the 2. November with the TV Baiersbronn, which was able to prevail clearly in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent on the field.
TSV Freudenstadt I: Dominik Bäuerle, Yannik Büchle, Sebastian Dölker, Felix Pälchen, Stefan Räller, Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz.
In the B-Class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially in the ball acceptance; even with the passes, the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes the overzealousness prevented the view for possible point wins.
In this very balanced encounter, however, Marcus Blasutto’s TSV team was consistently in line with the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment between both teams.
Gechingen: No absolute protection possible
"We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage," Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizen information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants had come to the community hall to have the planned measures explained, to ask questions, to express concerns and to contribute ideas.
Häußler clarified: "The final decisions are made by the members of the municipal council".
The flood, the Gechingen on the 15. May 2009, unprepared, had been a drastic event that raised the question of protection measures for the future, according to Häußler.
A river basin investigation had been commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The protection of as many built-up plots of land as possible is the goal," says Häußler.
The planning of protection against a statistically expected flood every 100 years according to the German weather service is based on the planning.
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 percent surcharge.
In professional circles, this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses, which had caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009, corresponded to a 1000-year flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement," said Häußler.
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima, around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen, whereby the municipality can expect state grants of around 70 percent.
However, Häußler pointed out that the funding only exists if an overall concept is implemented.
For this purpose, the municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process must be completed.
In the best case, implementation could begin in 2016.
Among other things, the protection concept, which was already presented in the municipal council last week (we reported) provides for local measures in the inflow of the river Irm from the Stammheim valley.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why more dams and retention basins were not planned to protect the place.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner of the commissioned engineering firm Wald and Corbe from Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, emphasized that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented in order to achieve the desired goal.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, according to Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Displeasure reigned among residents of the old town, who suffer again and again from an overload of the canal network, even in normal thunderstorms.
The problem is known to the administration and initial action has already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the guidelines for sewer systems were different from those for flood protection and that this should not be mixed.
The municipality is obliged to design the canal network in such a way that two to three-year rain events could be coped with.
To dimension the sewers larger would devour millions.
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to linger and return.
One that wants to make the name a program.
According to the lexicon, Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
In the case of a visit to the Café am Opschlag of the same name in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhein-Waal University of Applied Sciences, it does not have to stay with the pure Déjà Vu feeling.
After all, the café with the beautiful name has exactly that as its goal: to make an actual stay not only mentally, but always recurringly tangible.
Because it's fun and just beautiful.
A look into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling right away.
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the helm spoils the guest with various coffee or cocktail variants.
There are delicious cakes or individually topped fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as restaurateurs before the opening of the pretty café on the Opschlag: In Kranenburg, they ran the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the Opschlag, the sympathetic café lovers hope for more audiences.
Not least through the university.
"We do not have a specific target group," emphasizes Daniel Büttner.
Rather, the two young students here want to appeal to young students in the same way as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of cafe lovers.
The likeable owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations.
Expressofan
Daniel Büttner is more of an Expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette on that - that's my thing," she reveals to the NRZ.
There were also two events in the bright café.
Or rather, one.
Because the harbour festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it.
But there was also the Ringelnatzabend.
"Nice, successful and funny," the two 33-year-olds found.
But not everyone's cause.
Maybe that's why Daniel Büttner is not an outspoken fan of event evenings: "You can't please everyone".
And with an event, I only ever address those who are also interested in the special event.
That’s why events will be the exception with us.
“We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible.”
This means that Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.

Jumbo manufacturers argue in face of large orders over seat width
There has been an altercation between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seat that is offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those airlines are most concerned about, but this designated space is the key to the efficiency claims on the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. aircraft.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, yet U.S. arch-rival Boeing says airlines should decide that.
The dispute comes at a time when the aircraft manufacturers are vying to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and at the event from 17 to 21. November expect record orders.
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is crucial for the stated economic results that the new "mini-jumbo" design is to deliver.
Boeing claims its modernized "777X" holds 406 people at seats in the tourist class, which are over 17 inches wide and thus allow ten per row.
Airbus says the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18-inch-wide seats in the tourist class, with nine per row.
Aircraft giants often hand out blows about technical details by means of advertising in the trade press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to make the race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company unveiled an ad that could be the start of a new ad war and showed donors a picture in which three people sit squeezed in a restaurant, and the title: "Would you accept that?"
"Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turbo props," says Airbus sales chief John Leahy.
In the face of changing dietary habits, people are getting fatter, but aircraft seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the male average American between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
The waist circumference of the male average American in the 21. Century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival adheres to a seating concept from the 1950s, when the average body circumference of the freshly christened "Jet Set" was narrower.
According to Airbus, investigations have been carried out that show that an additional tariff (2.54 cm) per seat increased the sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies Airbus' figures on seat dimensions and says it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines are shaping the balance between air fares and facility.
The company also explains that, according to research, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
“It really boils down to giving airlines flexibility so they can do what they think they need to succeed,” said Kent Craver, a flight cabin expert at Boeing.
They don't want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone.
For passengers, it is about more elbow-free, but for manufacturers it is increasingly becoming an issue that can affect sales.
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $700 billion by list prices in the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results depend in part on the 777 compare the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased cost per unit is still lower than with currently used machines with ten seats per row.
"Boeing is therefore squeezing more seats into his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products," says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at Europe's Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 777s suggested that many passengers opted for the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper air fares.
“Eighteen-inch seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is: from an economic point of view, the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777,” says Mary Kirby, expert in cabin furnishings, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose.
The world-traveling jet sellers even carry tape measure with them to measure the facility in the competition.
Even if they praise the comfort, all manufacturers also offer jets with a highly compacted design for low-cost airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seat rows, but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus has stressed the importance of more customizability of cabins and offering wide seats at the aisles for some jets.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of major modern jets, experts say the call for a new industry standard is likely to fizzle out, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
According to Lexika, veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but differs from it in a very considerable way.
Because while vegetarians allow themselves to eat cream cake, ice cream or a strong edamer, these feasts are not on the menu of a vegan.
Milk, cheese, egg, in addition to the absence of meat and fish, the vegan abandons from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied.
What remains, one may ask, but on closer inspection the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity.
"Bread spreads are very popular," explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which offers a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the shop in Domgasse.
The native of New Zealand has been living vegan for 13 years, and in Lampertheim he finds (almost) everything he needs to live. “In 1997, I changed my diet and became a vegetarian.”
At the turn of the century, the next step took place and I became a vegan.
"The conviction came not only because of the diet, but because of the choice of shoe," says Proctor, who prefers artificial leather to normal leather.
He realized that it is also possible in other everyday matters without animal products.
First and foremost, being vegan is an ethics.
"I don't want animals to have to die for me," Proctor pronounces the maxim of vegans, which extends to all consumption behavior.
Instead of mourning burgers, scrambled eggs or gummy bears, the vegan quickly discovered completely new products, the enthusiasm increased.
"It's a double bonus," Proctor says today, "in fact, being vegan is not a waiver, not asceticism, it's an enrichment." Proctor is more likely to attribute the power of habit to reduce the choice of food options with the change in diet.
And it was precisely these conditionings that made some well-intentioned attempts fail.
"The addictive factor is a very decisive factor that makes many give up quickly, similar to smoking," Proctor makes a comparison.
And adverts: "Certain tastes are not to be attached to the animal".
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also create the same effect in other ways," the vegan explains.
Proctor brings eggplants, mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He pays attention to a balanced, varied diet, in which it should also taste hearty.
Of course, you want to have something between your teeth, that is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but that's not just to be reduced to animal food," Proctor said.
He did not suffer any health damage to eating disorders, another widespread assumption.
For me, the changeover had a positive aspect.
I do not absorb foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are great, I often get checked," Proctor reveals.
In particular, many vegansim critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12.
"Since animals are fed with feed, instead of grazing in the pasture, it is questionable whether the vitamin B12 content is high in the meat you buy in the freezer," Proctor finds.
For vegans, there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets.
"My B12 values are fine," he explains.
Proctor does not have to go long distances for food procurement.
After all, basic food is everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
Everything I need, I find on the spot.
Only from time to time I buy something special.
“A lot of people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive, but this is how it is “ordinary” finished products are known to be.”
In any case, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, with a few small tricks you can achieve good, if not partly better, results," says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking soda and carbonic acid instead of egg, with his vegan cheesecake Proctor was also able to amaze his in-laws.
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice.
This has momentum, when you cook together, it has a new place.
"The situations that can arise in the process are as different as the people themselves," says Proctor.
Of course, he has also been faced with skepticism.
You don't like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - with such questions, you have to act as a vegan with sensitivity.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society," Proctor doesn't want to live an enclave existence.
And in more detail, the everyday world does not appear as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as restricted in everyday life as commonly assumed.
Fast food is also allowed.
Fries are everywhere!
"Many kebab shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he avoids pasta dishes, or just orders a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are slowly getting into it.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, everything was much more difficult," the New Zealander can find a development: "You have to talk to people, make them aware of it."
"If enough demands come, they may be inclined to supplement the menu," he hopes.
Vegan restaurants are developing, such as the galley in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei.
Proctor has the wish that other restaurants have at least a vegan dish on the menu.
Basically, vegan dishes are there for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they are just the opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, and in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others," Proctor notes.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, then veganism is a sure way to make most of it impossible from the outset," says Proctor.
However, the purchase of vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning.
Especially if one learns to understand that animal additives can also contain in peanuts as coloring agents, one seems to quickly leave the courage with the observance of ethics with so many hurdles and traps.
Not only for this reason, Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book: "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" explains the many ingredients that are used for food and cleaning products.
"Gradually you develop a scanner view and know which signs and logos you have to pay attention to "It's sometimes better to take small steps than to stop or stumble," Proctor knows.
Veganism, it is an important moral finger pointing that strikes consciousness.
Perhaps he doesn’t quite manage to put down his habits, but at least he can teach consumers to critically question their habits.
Bayern's basketballer optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague could not diminish the huge optimism among the basketball players of FC Bayern Munich.
"No one can forbid us to believe in winning against the best team in Europe in the past two years," Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at defending champion Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: Basketball also exists in Munich!
In their only third appearance in the European premier class, the Munich sold very well for a long time, but were simply not clear enough in the decisive phases.
The guests first managed the trick to convert a 15-point backlog 13 minutes before the end into a lead before Piraeus gave the game another turnaround.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made reckless mistakes again," Bayern pro Yassin Idbihi said.
We are proud of our performance, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the Munich-based champions, who had celebrated significant victories in the first two matches against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title holder Zielona Góra.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could put a stop to the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human testing, more attempts are needed, which may take a few more years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results were good.
“We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to quit and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches,” said Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been altered to include the genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so that a smoker does not experience nicotine high.
In trials, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity level.
Mice without vaccination, on the other hand, had taken a "time-out," the researchers explained, a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccinations had to be given so frequently to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably significantly lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is quite sure, could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop.
"They know that when they start smoking again, they don't feel any pleasure because of the nicotini vaccine, and that helps them to put off the habit," he explains.
British scientists said the findings were interesting, but warned at the same time that further research was still needed.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but is also heavier food than necessary.
The plot, set in France in the 1760s, tells the poignant story of Suzanne, a young nobleman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination of another.
The film never slides into lust or sensationalism – and that’s where its problem lies.
The solemn seriousness with which the film is told also makes it a cruel penitential shirt for the audience.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected president
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is unlikely to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been forced out of office 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court, dressed in black robes, which is based on the Nile and is modeled on an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability,” said the 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that had been sharply targeted by the respective government since its founding 84 years ago, mostly as a banned organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small car convoy shortly after eleven a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered outside the court to cheer for the new president, and unlike presidential pomp from the Mubarak period, traffic was only briefly stopped so the car convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Mocked as an uncharismatic "replacement wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech, in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists, but of all those who wanted to bring the aspirations of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the goal.
"Egypt is now a civilian, national, constitutional and modern state," the Morsi, dressed in a blue suit with a red tie, explained to the judges in the wood-paneled chamber where he took the oath of office.
Later, Morsi drove to the University of Cairo, where he was to give his inaugural address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel that played the national anthem, to which he listened to in a hawk position.
Military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of attendees in the university's largest lecture hall with chants of "The army and the people are a hand."
The University of Cairo, built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahir Square on Friday, the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and he vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken over from office-hung state chief.
Yet with the taking of the official oath before the court and not in front of parliament as usual, he bows to the will of the military, indicating that the power struggle will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
Nagold: Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years
At the age of 60 as a singer, Hubert Wermter’s history at the men’s singing club Cecilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival, in which he was honored.
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colours of his male singing club.
Even after 60 years, singing with the now probably more than dearly won choir still enjoys him.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
Jörg Kohr, pastoral officer on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him with a certificate from the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst, since the choir is also a church choir.
His fellow singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association as well as an engraved tin plate.
In addition to the honor, the 31. Autumn festival in the usual ways: With the MGV Betra, the Liederkranz Salzstetten, the singers department Baisingen and the local Musikverein, the Vollmaringer had invited a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles, which entertained the approximately 400 visitors.
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as "Im Weinparadies" and "Lustig, ihr Brüder".
They prepared a small serenade for their honorary singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied" for the honor.
The men's singing club Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jägerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Weit, weit weg" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "Wann du durchs durchs Tal".
The Liederkranz Salzstetten provided with its mixed choir and its women's group - the "Impulschor" - for the women's quota of the festival.
The mixed choir took "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus to foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk style, while the "Impulschor" also resorted to foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were part of their program.
The singers' department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to local fields with "Was isch der Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Bierlied", where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion.
For the children there was a small side program - "Grandma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperltheater and read a few stories, which the children spent the lunch over well busy.
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 from passengers who want to stow on their carry-on luggage.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even if it was read in Wednesday's announcement that passengers are likely to keep the whole can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the luggage compartment above the seat, small bags under the seat are still free of charge.
Frontier said it charges $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who only paid at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee was aimed at getting travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to calculate that sum," she explained.
Airlines began charging fees for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into hand luggage, which means that the luggage compartments above the seat are often overcrowded.
Fees are a way to persuade passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier, who have clearly expressed that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a piece of luggage with him free of charge at the frontier gate, but the next person may have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were notified of the fee before they came to the gate.
Frontier's new hand luggage fee won't come into effect until the summer, an exact date does not yet exist.
Passengers often scold baggage surcharges and other fees, but airlines like to resort to it.
They argue that transporting the luggage costs money and passengers should pay for that service if they wished it.
Many on Wall Street view the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most have so far left the fingers of charges for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. was the first to charge for carry-on baggage three years ago and later followed Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who is closely following the additional fees.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee Spirit brings in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, who formerly held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would await him at the gate if passengers were faced with the company's unusual carry-on baggage fee.
“The boarding process was among the smoothest I have experienced in my career in aviation,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and tangible discussions on the gate.
"The plane was full," he explained, "and the boarding was going like greased."
Frontier also follows Spirit at the $2 charged for coffee, tea, lemonade or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice were allowed to keep the whole can and coffee would be refilled for free.
Water is still free.
US Airways briefly tried to charge money for soft drinks in 2008, but reversed it seven months later after passengers complained and no other large company had followed suit.
Frontier's move to charge fees for carry-on baggage if passengers don't buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This provides an incentive for all companies to persuade passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone the furthest in this area.
In September, the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut once again to 25 percent of the flight route.
A flight booked with a third-party provider with Frontier over 1000 miles therefore only earns customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats only when buying directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver, but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money.
Revenue declined 9 percent and flight capacity shrank just under 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by the parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic has tried to get a grip on Frontier's finances as part of the company's sale.
Sleepless in New York
On the way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium got to know the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, we immediately went to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of the city, Manhattan, on foot.
Here was already a fascinating view of the world-famous skyline, which is a special charm in the evening light.
Due to the time difference, the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The city does not sleep" the day in Times Square was decided.
Despite shutdown, the Statue of Liberty could be reached by ferry on the second day and climbed on foot.
Afterwards, it was over the financial center around Wall Street to the memorial of the 11. Septembers.
On the third day, students were able to gain an overview of the fascinatingly large city from the 373-meter-high viewing platform of the Empire State Building, while enjoying the view.
Afterwards, we went through the hustle and bustle of New York Streets across Rockefeller Center to Central Park, which provided an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived in their host families and experience the school day at Weymouth High School.
For national and international investors, there is no way around the real estate location Germany.
The economic framework data is right, and the financing options are excellent.
This is the tenor of the 9. Real estate days of the Börsen-Zeitung.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country in a European comparison.
Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa of Jones Lang LaSalle, will be on the 9th. Real estate day of the Börsen-Zeitung pointed out.
According to Ulbrich, the search for German commercial real estate is shown by a view to the transaction volume.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the prior-year period.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rate," Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at a historically high level.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in tragic accident believe in murder
The teenager's parents, whose body was found in a rolled-up wrestling mat in the gym of his high school, are convinced their son was murdered, the family's lawyer explained Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was released on 11. Found January in an upright mat that stood behind the grandstand in the school gym.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the 17-year-old's family doubted.
"They are convinced that their son has been murdered," Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded.
"They believe that it lacks any logic that violates the laws of physics as well as common sense," Crump said.
Rather, they are convinced that the truth is being covered up to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in the body bag," he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death as a number of important questions were still unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death due to a crime?
This was stated by Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in whatever direction they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy suggested that Johnson had died as a result of a “positional suffocation.”
However, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death, according to Moore.
"There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if there is sufficient evidence of a criminal or civil investigation into the death of Johnson, he will instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Office was not immediately ready for comment at our request on Thursday.
A South Georgia court on Wednesday ordered that authorities must release all surveillance footage that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video recordings contained clues as to how he had died.

John Kerry declares in an unprecedented admission that U.S. espionage has gone "inappropriately too far"
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated a softening of the U.S. defensive stance on its surveillance programs, saying the espionage had "gone inappropriately too far" in certain cases.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, together with Barack Obama, was responsible for switching to "autopilot" when the explosive revelations of whistleblower Edward Snowden about the NSA's spying activities became public.
Through the leaked information, the U.S. government has fallen into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies.
During a video-connected speech at the Open Government conference in London, Kerry said: “Without question, the President and I, as well as others in the government, learned of some things that have virtually expired by autopilot, simply because the ability to do was still about the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War, as well as, of course, the 11th. September is back."
He then admitted as the first senior member of the U.S. government that U.S. espionage had crossed a line, but also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, that has gone too far inappropriately."
The president is determined to clarify, and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons in this process will not be compromised.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved by its surveillance operations.
He added: "We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up."
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if you were able to intercept and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learned of such plans in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the U.S. in counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs declared on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in counterterrorism organizations because of the frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It is very important for U.S. national security interests that Europeans stay on board with a view to our joint efforts against terrorism," Murphy, who sits in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, regardless of their anger about the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some U.S. allies, although the head of the intelligence community said this week the reports were inaccurate and were based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations quoted from documents passed on by Snowden, according to which the NSA had monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage among allies as necessary and declared this was common on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his agency was preparing the congressional trip to take place this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other participating MPs are due to be published in the coming days.
He said the exact itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he also spoke of the fact that there would be some “serious words.”
He said European governments had to be honest with their people about the kind of spying programs they themselves have been using for years.
"While we can change our surveillance programmes and better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also come to terms with the fact that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is planning a trip to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to deal with the grudge over the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as the US surveillance activities.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centers in the Zollernalbkreis receive mail these days.
The Black Forest messenger, in cooperation with Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb, would like to support the facilities in the realization of their construction and beautification wishes.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, daycare centres and crèches from the entire Zollernalb district can participate in the campaign.
If you have a request for construction or beautification for your facility, you can apply to the Black Forest messenger with it.
Be creative with your children and surprise the jury of the Aktion Kindergarten-Baustelle.
A jury consisting of representatives of Schwarzwälder Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb selects three wishes from all submissions.
What are the requirements for participation?
The desire should be realized with building material worth a maximum of 2000 euros and on a (action) day.
In addition, the winner himself must provide for many hard-working construction workers.
What is it about the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus, with the support of Sparkasse Zollernalb, provides the material.
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and of course the educators and children themselves.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave
Billionaire and MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and therefore could benefit.
The mining magnate, who is in a legal battle over paying $6 million in carbon tax, made the claim when he wanted to swipe questions off the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important for deciding whether to cut or cut carbon and mining taxes.
Yet Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
“He is in a big conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether she is on vacation or not,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes after the recount.
Palmer called for a revision of the vote counting process so that it would take place more quickly.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of voting?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you march in, enter the data into a computer, choose immediately and then have the result at 6:30 in the evening?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don’t like them?
To be tuned with pencils these days is incredible.
The Electoral Commission has considered the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, declared that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new office "very seriously."
A public office is about the service to the public.
“We strive for no reward except that of history, namely, that we can serve at a critical time of this community,” he said.
Esa decides on major space missions: Missions for billions
Far-off planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they plan to launch in the next few years.
There were 30 proposals to choose from, five are still in the race.
Faraway Worlds.
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already been found by astronomers.
Whether there is life on at least some of them, no one knows.
The selection is difficult: Should one look for gravitational waves?
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or search for Earth-like planets and thus perhaps discover alien life?
These questions are being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa.
For their "Cosmic Vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to decisively advance research.
The budget for such "L-missions" is each about one billion euros.
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034.
In early September, the elite of European space exploration met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas were up for debate, five of which have now been shortlisted.
Numerous committees examine the proposals, check with the researchers.
A final decision by the scientific program committee is to be made in the next few days.
Esa has selected a total of four major questions to which the missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program, which was initiated in 2007, should find answers.
What are the conditions for the formation of planets and life?
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the proverbial dark.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark.
And if a star has planets, under what circumstances can life arise there?
In order to investigate this question, the space telescope "Cheops" is to be launched in 2017, with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined in more detail in our vicinity.
However, the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
Using larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, and thus look for "biomarkers": gases that are considered an indication of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question should also ultimately provide information on the conditions for the emergence of life.
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation emitted by it with the planetary system.
In our solar system, these processes can be investigated by way of example.
With the "Solar Orbiter", the ESA has already approved a mission of the M-Class (where the budget is about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are also of great interest to the researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system.
For this purpose, ESA envisages the first of the three L-missions of the "Cosmic Vision" program.
The "Juice" probe (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to study the planet's atmosphere, as well as the icy moons Europa, Kallisto and Ganymede.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and thus to investigate whether the laws of nature known to us are still valid there.
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show physicists the way to a new theory, under whose roof all known laws of nature can be combined.
How did the universe come into being and what is it made of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the common matter, from which stars, planets and living things like us consist, there is dark matter, whose gravity holds together galaxies and galaxy clusters, and dark energy, through whose action the expansion of the universe accelerates.
So far, the researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, nor what dark matter and dark energy are made of.
With "Euclid", ESA has already approved an M-mission, the launch of which is scheduled for 2020.
With a special telescope, the probe is to investigate the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus enable conclusions about the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could make the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection process.
According to many experts, "E-Lisa", a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves, has the best chance of being granted as an L-mission.
This is understood by physicists to change in the structure of space-time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They have not been proven to this day.
Elisa could do that, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission envisages a detector consisting of two or three probes, which is stationed in space.
In contrast to plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves that originated at the Big Bang, thus providing new insights into the formation of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competing for the second L mission: a large X-ray telescope called "Athena," which is to explore black holes, among other things, "Icy Planets," another mission to the solar system's outer planets, "Prism," a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder," which is supposed to track down and study Earth-like planets.
Proposals for sample return transport from Mars, the study of the moon, Venus and asteroids and solar physics have already been eliminated.
CDC release allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a set of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children in schools.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing.
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy.
The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007, according to the CDC.
The guidelines provide information for schools designed to raise awareness of food allergies among the faculty and staff, and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to counter a potentially deadly hypersensitivity reaction.
Lawmakers in the states have recently changed regulations so that schools can more easily keep epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms called by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is pressing on my tongue,” “My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it,” or “My tongue is tingling.”
Firefighters called to rescue a pooch stuck 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rocky outcrop in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a minor road accident
Three days later, she was spotted by a walker in the quarry in her predicament
Firefighters roped themselves off rock face and rescued the dog from certain death
The fire brigade managed to bring a pooch to safety, which was stuck on a 15-meter-high lead in a rock face.
The nine-month-old Cockerspaniel dog Ruby had run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived alone for three days before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to receive Ruby again and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firefighters.
They had desperately searched for her missing bitch and posted calls for help on social networks when she escaped into the quarry after the minor traffic accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a walker running his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-metre-high heel in the quarry.
The Cleckheaton Fire Station's technical rescue team rushed to the spot and abseiled to rescue Ruby, which was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "She was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rock face – 15 meters from above and the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue - she was frozen.
But now she's fine.
She then ate some dog cakes.
This was a rather unusual deployment.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, specialist of the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby was very lucky."
There was a possibility that she was very badly injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he did not notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "To watch the rescue was scary."
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her in her arms again.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had become too great and it collapsed, it would probably have crashed.
The firefighters have done great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added, “We were afraid she was going to fall down, but she stayed upstairs.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
US border: 'Super tunnel' on drug smuggling discovered
On the border between Mexico and the U.S., investigators have discovered and shut down a "super-tunnel" for drug smuggling.
U.S. customs officials said the more than 500-meter-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, train tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized.
The tunnel had not yet been used.
"These cartels are stupid if they think they can dig through under the radar," Attorney General of the U.S. District of Southern California, Laura Duffy, said at a news conference outside a warehouse in San Diego, where one end of the tunnel had been discovered.
Addressing the drug gangs, Duffy said, “If you continue to build tunnels like this and try to use them, we’re determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money.”
Both U.S. authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77 have been in Mexico. killed 000 people in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
Because of the elaborate equipment of the tunnel, the investigators assume that it was designed by architects and engineers and that the construction took around a year.
The track was equipped in such a way that electrically operated wagons could be used there.
On the Mexican side, access is in a building 80 meters from the border.
According to authorities, a ladder leads 20 meters into the depths to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
He would also have been suitable to promote illegal immigration towards the USA.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine find.
The third, a Mexican, was caught because of the seized marijuana.
All three face life deprivation as a maximum sentence, officials said.
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006, the press conference in San Diego said.
This is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction.
Usually, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities rather than tunnels.
This shows the "desperation" of the drug gangs, whose traditional routes are now cut off, said Bill Sherman of the drug investigation DEA in San Diego.
They would do anything to get to the U.S.
No details were disclosed to those arrested, at least one was Mexican, it said.
You have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years.
Obama's backslide on health care policy
After heavy criticism, President Obama yesterday backed down on his frequently repeated, unequivocal promise: “If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands received a notice of termination from their insurer, Republicans accused the president in recent days of misrepresenting the American public.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
"The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep it," he said during a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports on the terminations, Obama urged those Americans who have received such communications to look around the free market for a new insurance company.
Most citizens could thus receive better, more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or cheaper than forecast.
"They're coming up with a better deal," he said.
The government described it as unsurprising that the five percent of the population who have taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different tariff, since their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
"I want to say to these Americans directly: they deserve better," Sebelius said at a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm just as frustrated and angry as everyone else," she said.
I am determined to regain your trust.
This statement by an angry Sebelius to an adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's House hearing was taken up after an argument with Republican lawmaker Billy Long of Missouri. This was about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly pressed with the question of why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily waived a state-sponsored insurance to take out a tariff on HealthCare.gov, which it now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Parents of intersex children may choose 'gender indefinitely'
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with inconclusive genitals.
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to declare gender for such children, but may state "indefinitely" or "not fixed" on the birth certificate.
The purpose of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding operations for a sex assignment in newborns, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person said years later: "I am neither a man nor a woman."
I remain the patchwork created by doctors, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is not born each year either as a boy or as a girl.
They belong to the intersex, a group that falls under the diagnosis of "sexual differentiation disorder" (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. advise that you should use the best available information for gender assignment if a provision is not possible, and do not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if at all – for surgery.
New York Psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in the issue of gender identification, said the new German law "sounds like a good thing."
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
"Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgical intervention, but this does not apply to most children," he said.
You can make a gender assignment without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops.
The scientific data on how a child even develops their gender identity is not very accurate.
No one knows why it is happening.
It's like the secret why people are homosexual.
A 2011 report to the European Commission said intersex people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons, because their status is not gender-related, but due to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were evident in subordinated sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, priority sexual characteristics such as reproducing organs and genitals, or in chromosome structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in professional life, as well as the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who do not match the gender image now have a special camp.
In the meantime, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to indicate male, female or "third gender" on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as the world's first "genderless" person after a court granted lifelong retention of "undefined" gender status.
In addition to M and W, German ID cards will have a third allocation, X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that the "gender theory" should be removed from school books.
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law, on the grounds: “If the world is dragged into a new state, where gender is a decision, but sexual activity is not, then we twist two more pillars of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would like it better if babies were assigned a gender at birth.
"Parental existence is already stressful enough without further restrictions, especially if you don't know the gender of your own child," she told the parent website.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were referred to as hermaphrodites, according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine regarded gender as something that could be wiped out and then rebuilt.
But in the meantime, the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned, after it is now known how complex the sexual identity is, and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they assign.
“In the middle of the 20. Century was called a “psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When such a child was born, then one called not the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with inconclusive genitals goes to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that gender was malleable.
He coined the term "sexual identity" and argued that social and environmental impulses – how parents raise a child – interacted with a child’s genes and hormones, thus shaping whether a person considers himself male or female.
However, in a 1966 case known as "John/Joan", his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been severed during a botched circumcision, to neuter the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
"Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, but it was not," said Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
At 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
Yet in the 1990s, with the entry of the Internet, survivors of these sex operations who are "not happy with the result" have come to the public.
For example, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitals.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never live a "satisfactory life" as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he should be given a vaginal plastic.
But since he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he demanded his medical records.
What he found out was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to male identity, received testosterone injections and had his breasts removed.
Through the operation, he has become infertile.
Today, he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for the fact that intersex people are perceived as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law can "encourage stamping and stigmatizing."
"Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a 'not fixed' to the child," she said.
We fear that this favours interventions.
We think it would be better to assign the male or female gender and then wait.
Yet we do not yet know how the law will affect, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognised as a third gender."
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender," she explained.
The German law is about the allocation at birth.
This is not a struggle to force young children to do at this point.
When they are adults, they can decide their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist from Pittsburg who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a support group, says German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect of the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Today, Katie is 29 and married; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff member in child psychiatry.
Although it is infertile, it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
"The law gives parents space, so they don't have to make decisions hastily," Baratz said.
It gives them the time to take different tests and clear things up and thus give them time before they write "male" or "female".
This way everything is fine – you raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the parenting happiness.
And you don't have to rush an operation that can no longer be undone.
"This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that drives parents because they think they are not doing the right thing," she explained.
Ultimately, the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that’s wonderful.
This will enable children to make the decision themselves.
Excellently mastered the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novella "The Old Man and the Sea," is cut to the body of Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his profession, the acting.
No one can fool the old man Santiago while fishing.
So the two simply complement each other great.
One almost thinks to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man, of which the fisherman's boy Manolo speaks.
If Santiago sits tired of life in the chair, that's real with Janson.
In addition, the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role, which Janson masters excellently.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his willpower.
Janson is on stage in long distances as a stand-alone actor.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself, so his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village.
In the course of the performance, he puts the active scene in the light: the hut of Santiago, the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her glorious voice the attitude to life of Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba’s rhythm and are also guests of the bar.
Looking for ice cream that glows in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice glowing in the dark – with the help of jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a luminous treat from it.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the glowing protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed, which raises the pH in the protein and triggers the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the warmth in the mouth and glows – so the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick Me I'm Delicious," says: "The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds."
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth heats the protein, the pH rises and the ice lights up.
We have been testing it for the past few months and it seemed ideal to us to bring it to market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminous effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the jellyfish fluorescent is four times more expensive than gold.
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But for that, it tastes delicious.
Charlie's experimental firm, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavours, which include beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He said, “I’d like to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is impossible in and of itself because of the refraction of light caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream; but I suspect we find a way to make it.
The ice cream utilizes the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish artificially produced by Chinese scientists
Salem: Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum
At the next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday, 21. October, the New Museum of the Castle is about the topic "To Hell with Hell - Theological Considerations on Today's Handling of the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parishes of Salem, the Salem Palace and the Bodenseekreis Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in the past centuries, relying on those images of heaven and hell "that still shape our ideas today," the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes of completion is rather characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechlessness.
"The greater hope has been duly driven out by the criticism of religion," says the speaker.
“I have provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks.”
Johanna Rahner goes on to say: "But the decisive challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is the question of that longing that “dreams that everything will be good in the end.”
Johanna Rahner, born in 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert Ludwigs University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She received her doctorate in 1997 as Dr. theol., also in Freiburg.
The Habilitation for Fundamental Theology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westphalian Wilhelm University.
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hechingen: Mass gives answer to wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery that man can undertake," said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to at least the wedding celebration succeed was now given by a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Important providers were represented around a wedding.
A trend: The retro look has made its inroads again.
This starts with the wedding dresses, for example.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
At the front, the often ruffled and embroidered clothes are closed, often with a veil, but in the back they go down their backs and often end in a tow.
However, the ghosts differ, as Stefanie Koch from the fashion house Kleidermüller points out.
In men, the suit dominates with vest and plastron, but it can also be selected for cream-colored or brown combinations.
What is important is the selection of the restaurant, it was explained.
Jewelleresse adjoining rooms are not optimal, the ambience should be special.
Here, the domain drew attention to its own offer in the draw.
If you want to drive the carriage, Uwe Link has an offer for you.
"But carriages are also popular for bachelorette parties," he says.
Romance is also in demand for invitation cards, floral arrangements and also for wedding pictures.
More and more in fashion is the "after-wedding photo" - so recording series in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the festival, but in wedding clothes, explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and also a magician, such as Marko Ripperger, who can entertain guests in style.
Not to forget the right cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable celebration.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, on Thursday sought an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the company that was outbid by him at Nortel's bankruptcy auction.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringements in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases.
The patents concern technology that brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, according to the lawsuit that hits the core of Google’s search engine business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid for over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google boosted its offering several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After being outbid on Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a business that was also motivated in part by Motorola's library of patents.
"Although Google failed with its attempt to acquire the patents at auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so," the complaint said.
Rockstar is demanding high damages from Google as it claims Google's patent infringement is intentional, according to the allegation.
Frankfurt parking fees to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become sensitively more expensive.
The city's magistrate is discussing a proposal from Transport Departmenter Stefan Majer (Greens) this morning.
Parking fees are to be increased by 50 percent.
For this purpose, however, the prices should not be raised, but the time interval of parking meters and parking ticket machines should be shortened from 30 to 20 minutes.
In December, the town council has to decide.
The Retail Committee of the Frankfurt Chamber of Industry and Commerce considers this "not a good idea".
The parking facility immediately in front of the shop is "a not to be underestimated advantage for smaller specialist dealers."
The Verkehrsclub Deutschland is of the opinion that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and actually long overdue".
Public transport will also be more expensive.
Oil price continues to drop to $96 per barrel
The price of oil also continued to fall on Friday after worries about a high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil variety for deliveries in December had fallen by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange in the late morning.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which meant a 5.8 percent drop in prices in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that the U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
Yet on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of activity growth in Chinese manufacturing.
This suggests a continued recovery in China's economy, whose growth had risen to 7.8 percent in the third quarter, after it reached its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Crude oil from the Brent variety, a reference value for international crude oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the ICE Exchange in London.
The throwaway society doesn't think
The night was long, the music loud and the mood good, but at some point it's going home.
Only: In the bellies of the people in the passenger and back seat, the hunger is noticeable.
Sure, one or the other cocktail or sparkling wine may be responsible for that!
What could be more obvious than to drive chilled to the next drive-in to treat yourself to a little something?
I admit, I like to be there when it comes to fast food fetching late at night or early in the morning.
A few fries, a coke, a burger - and then nothing like off home and into bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco-goers make themselves felt.
Because what does you have to miss that you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with constant regularity?!
Especially on the weekends, discarded paper bags lie on roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?" I wonder.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home or the next bin?
It’s not just that the paper stuff is disfiguring the landscape.
Bags have already concealed traffic facilities such as guardrails and thus triggered accidents.
However, this "throwaway society" does not think about this, probably she does not even know what this word actually means.
If you are on the road more often in the evening, especially with several people in the car, you know what a back seat can look like after celebrated nights: clothes, bottles and other garbage tower there.
A few bags would more or less not make up anything - in contrast to the street, where no one wants to trample on the food scraps of others.
I can already see the day when the cities and municipalities get too stupid to clear away - and the fast food chains have to demand deposits for their bags.
Milk and egg alternatives at a glance
Vegan diet requires plant-based alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
Pureed tofu with plant cream, for example, is a quark substitute.
Others are named by the Vegetarian Association for World Vegan Day on 1. November.
The Vegetarian Association of Germany beats on the occasion of the World Vegan Day on the 1. November a number of vegan alternatives before:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, yogurt can be replaced by soy yogurt.
Instead of milk, soy, oat, almond or rice milk can be used.
Impactable plant cream replaces conventional whipped cream.
There are also plant-based alternatives to eggs.
Half a crushed, mature banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of applesauce or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable for this.
For example, doughs become loose instead of egg with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking soda, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But also 50 grams of soy yogurt or silk tofu can fulfill this purpose.
According to the Vebu, around 800 000 people in Germany currently eat vegan, i.e. purely plant-based.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that finds space in the dashboard of every car.
The devices that record every kilometer driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the states' planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly also where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax assessments.
The Tea Party is horrified.
The U.S. Civil Rights Association (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and voices a number of privacy concerns.
But while you can’t agree on a course of action in Congress, several states are no longer waiting.
They are currently examining how to switch to a system over the course of the next ten years where drivers pay per mile driven.
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs, some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance.
This is truly a must for our country.
"It's not something we're just going to possibly use," said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of Southern California Assn. of Governments, which is planning a record of miles driven among all California motorists in the state from 2025.
The way we pay those taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded from taxes that pay Americans at the fuel dispenser, is broke.
But in America, there is not as much fueling as before.
Cars consume less gasoline.
The state petroleum tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) has not risen for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by a cent at high fuel prices.
"The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a traffic law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to be used to test a mile-based payment system.
"This is the most sensible alternative in the long term," he said.
Bureaucrats refer to it as a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is well received by urban liberals, because the tax could be used, for example, to influence the driving behavior in such a way that traffic jams and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced.
California planners are relying on the system for developing strategies designed to achieve the state's ambitious, legally enshrined climate change targets.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation’s free marketers are also impressed by the idea of letting drivers pay after the distance has travelled.
“This isn’t a tax that disappears into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of guidelines at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also backed by two previous American transport ministers who, in a 2011 report, had called on Congress to move towards mile-based billing.
The U.S. Senate last year approved a $90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars.
Yet the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push, responding to concerns from lawmakers from rural areas representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life.
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction on their own.
The most dedicated is Oregon, which currently recruits 5,000 drivers for the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the petroleum tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is also considering one.
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transportation ministries of 17 states on the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how one might introduce the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices, motorists were skeptical at the thought the government could track any of its movements.
"Concerns about Big Brother and things like this have been a big problem," said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and results management at Nevada's Transportation Department.
People didn't want it.
When the test started, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into mature surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is among a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can use to capture the kilometers driven, but not exactly when and where.
With that, according to Khan, the public would be more reassured, too.
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California.
The firm did not originally compete to help states tax motorists.
Rather, their goal was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are supposed to pay based on the miles driven.
But the devices it tested are also interesting for the road planners, because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information, which is regularly uploaded by modem.
“People are more willing to get involved if their speed and locations are not recorded,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Big mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programs.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they don't choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the miles driven on average by all residents of the state.
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more features than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that can also be used to pay parking fees, insurance only has to be paid for kilometres driven and speed data is collected in real time from other vehicles, thanks to which motorists can avoid traffic jams.
"Motorists would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits the system offers," the city's planning document said.
However, some traffic planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction.
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area, officials said Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax.
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on motorists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gasoline, so that they also pay a fair share.
"There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient," said Randy Rentschler, the Commission's head of legislation and public affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists worry about their privacy and numerous other things.
Bad-Dürrheim: A dream comes true for FC
The significance for the city and the football club was not lost in the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass sports field despite the cold weather and the rain.
Everyone had probably wished for a more pleasant celebration last Saturday, but Peter did not want to play along.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold such one for any reason.
This was the case for the musicians who framed the ceremony, as well as many a speaker.
FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker, who spoke of the fulfillment of a dream, therefore also became wet.
His thanks went to Mayor Walter Klumpp, who was strongly committed to the implementation of the project, the local council, the participating companies and members of the association who contributed.
Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The sleek pensioners laid 400 square meters of paving stones for the new paths.
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also appreciated by the member of the state parliament Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given for the municipal sports committee Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr from the planning office, who announced a donation for the youth department of the club.
Mayor Klumpp brought to the memory that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original grass pitch in such a way that it could not be used.
Already 15 years ago, there were the first considerations for the solution of the problem, when the construction of a third place at the grounds of the football club or at the Realschule am Salinensee was thought of.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, thoughts came up for the creation of an artificial grass sports field, which was generally considered the ultimate solution.
Concrete planning was started two years ago, when the FC took over the Schabelstube in lease, pledged a cost contribution of 100 000 euros for the construction of the square and the country approved funding of 104 000 euros.
In October 2012, the municipal council decided to take over the remaining €356 000 at the total cost of €560 000, Klumpp summarized.
The construction of the 68 by 108 meter artificial grass pitch began on the 4th. June.
During the construction phase, which lasted more than three months, 3000 cubic meters of soil were removed, half of which was used for the creation of a dirt bike track.
Unknowns injure girl by shot from car
Unknowns have injured a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt in shots from a car.
The perpetrators had on Thursday evening in Genthin presumably fired with an air pressure weapon on a group of children.
This was announced by the police in Burg.
The girl was slightly injured on the left calf.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The shot came from a small car that had driven past a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
One slice broke.
They then drove away.
Criminal police are investigating, it said on Friday.
Snowden ready to 'cooperate' with Germany in relation to US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower of the U.S. intelligence agency, has said he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers about their activities.
German lawmaker Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he was granted asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: “Even though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a breach of allegiance and tries to criminalize political expression with a threat of punishment, in which no defense is possible.”
Telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: "If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that possible."
The relations between the US and Germany are strained by the claims that the NSA has wiretapped the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the deputy who chairs the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said he should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness, if possible, “without jeopardizing it and completely ruining relations with the US.”
Ströbele, a member of the Greens, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that, according to the lawyer of former NSA employee Snowden, Snowden, could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, then he needs an assurance that he is "safe" there, according to the MP.
Snowden said in his letter that he would be facing a “serious and ongoing” campaign of persecution that drove him out of his homeland.
However, he was touched by the worldwide reaction to "my act of political expression".
Citizens around the world, as well as senior politicians -- including in the United States -- have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden makes an offer of cooperation to the German authorities "when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities
Thousands of people gathered in central Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the state founder and first president of Mozambique, to voice calls for peace at a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace again, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Fearing for the future of the country, she traded her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital's Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo, which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement initially backed by White-ruled Rhodesia and later South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
Under the 1992 peace treaty, she became an opposition party.
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict, yet recent events have worried foreign investors and locals.
There is a lot at stake for the fast-growing economy, because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal storage facilities in the northwest could bring investments of over $50 billion from firms such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the U.S. to the country over the next few years.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims the government has provoked recent clashes by saying on 17. October would have attacked its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos.
The assaults on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of assaulting soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability.
He told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers himself a "loser" who wants to "use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government."
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war.
Yet concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," Mazanga said.
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the settlement of the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year.
"We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who collide their heads," says Joseph Hanlon, a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert.
None of them are good at negotiating and none are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is pushing for electoral reforms, has already said she will boycott local elections in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by an ailing movement to obtain concessions and financial perks from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a newer party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM) founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation will be held when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country’s democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want transparent elections, he doesn't want peace because he doesn't want to give up the presidency," Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has undertaken unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south connection.
Most of the battles took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but in which Beira is located, the port, which mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal.
In June, Rio interrupted the use of the railroad for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to "warn the international community that things in Mozambique are not going well," Mazanga said.
Instability has increased the frustration over the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, the sluggish progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems,” he explains.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people just wanted stability.
"No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads again," he said.
Hansjakob moves once again to Freihof
100 years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved into his retirement home in Haslach, on Sunday his last years in the "Freihof" came alive.
The many spectators were thrilled by the extremely entertaining scene play.
From the arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining piece that received a lot of applause under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience as a speaker through the ten different scenes, explained connections and bridged time jumps from youth to approaching retirement.
On the 22. In October 1913, Hansjakob came home to his children's sky, in his courtyard.
And then began the scene play, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parade role as the city's great son.
He drove in style with the Zweispänner and "Schwarzwälder Füchsen" by Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach.
He was not only received by the audience with much applause, his sister Philippine also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to put herself into the role of the sister and gave her tremendous life in facial expressions and gestures.
Between the individual playing scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played suitably selected pieces of music and thus rounded off the performance.
In order to award the honorary citizenship, Haslach’s mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor, who, in representation of the then incumbent Hättich, together with a part of the city council, made his appearance.
Their wait was then made by the three-king singers, who prompted Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh how beautiful, there are again youth memories of my own Three Kings' time come alive".
With their song "O Jesulein" they delighted the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud "Out, Out".
Hansjakob had expressed his criticism of the official church at the time as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war.
In the homeland, behind his burial chapel on the fire near Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless ghost had finally found its calm and had gone home forever," it said at the end of the scene play.
There was a lot of applause and many words of praise from the audience for the performance.
Chinese newspaper to be 'reformed' after call
A Chinese newspaper that had demanded on the front page the release of a reporter who had been charged with defamation was to be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to fake reports of a part-state company.
The New Express is now undergoing "comprehensive rectification," the regulator said.
The "Rectification Order" was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express, which is part of Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several inaccurate reports about the publicly traded company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly," the regulator said in a statement.
She said she had decided to "impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to strip him of his reporter's license."
“The Yangcheng Evening News Group has also been instructed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant persons in charge of the New Express be identified and that the New Express management team be immediately reviewed.”
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After being arrested, the newspaper published two appeals for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports in exchange for payment.
"In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion, as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain the public's trust," he told CCTV.
I did it first and foremost because I was out for money and fame.
I realized that I did wrong.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express issued an apology on the front page, saying it failed to review the reports correctly.
Various known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still being forced routinely, despite a change in the law earlier this year, in which authorities were banned from forcing someone to blame themselves.
Löffingen: Köpfler still only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although the Baarstädtchen Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children's, youth and senior citizens' policy, as well as its own municipal utilities can be described as an attractive city, no second mayoral candidate has yet come forward.
The only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who is no longer running for office for reasons of age, has so far been the 46-year-old banker and business economist Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The application deadline is Monday, 11. November, at 6 p.m.
Haigerloch: Church of the Lord’s Supper comes into focus
As a contribution of the city to the 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the Culture and Tourism Office is dedicating the last of its public themed tours to this year on Sunday, 27. October, the Church of the Lord's Supper.
After the visit to the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period is to be considered after 1850, when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule.
The crowning finale is a visit to the Church of the Lord’s Supper.
There, the leaders are told the story of the construction of the church and gain insights into the development of the evangelical community in a thoroughly Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also overlooks the Lord’s Supper painting created by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is an original reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
Meeting point for the one-and-a-half-hour guided tour is at 15 o’clock at the Atomkeller Museum.
Tickets are available at the ticket office of the Atomkellermuseum.
For questions and information, the tourist office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Mick Jagger explains that he never turned on Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she was a backing singer to collaborate on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard."
Perry explained that she had dinner with the alt-rocker, and that “he hit me when I was 18.”
She added, “That was a long time ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, Jagger's representative, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denies that he had ever made approach attempts at Katy Perry."
The representative added, “Maybe she has confused him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album "Prism" landed immediately at #1 this week.
NSA says an "internal mistake" and not hackers are to blame for the website's crash
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that an error had paralyzed its public website for a few hours and not hackers, as was claimed online.
"NSA.gov was unavailable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update," the spy agency said in an emailed message.
The problem will be fixed this evening.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and this is still not for some users.
Earlier, a NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “in no way compromised.”
Secret information is not in danger, according to the spokesman.
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
With such attacks, the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly super-secret NSA, whose nickname was once No Such Agency, now finds itself in the bright light of the public and faces sharp criticism after the revelations about their extensive surveillance program at home and abroad, which have become known in recent months – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the Secret Service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Snowden could also testify in Russia
Former U.S. intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in the U.S. spy affair in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Prosecutor General's Office could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
This was reported by the agency Interfax, citing unspecified circles that were familiar with the situation.
Such a question could be clarified intergovernmentally, it said.
Snowden's departure from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he is losing his refugee status," the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden threatened the extradition there, it said.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "role models for life," says one author.
Thor's stories showed that "brutal power has no chance against clever tricks," and the Arthurian legend demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
However, many of the myths are “far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools,” which is why Crossley-Holland advocated for a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I find it wonderful that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years.
He added that with writers and teachers who are "excessively didactic," children would "completely shut down," because in entertaining stories, the messages would be conveyed "subliminally."
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, declared: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible."
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy ending, but there is an immanent sense of good and evil.
This must be subliminally represented, revealed by history and not explained.
This is the old story of showing instead of telling.
You thought travel agencies are a thing of the past thanks to the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend.
The company has increased its full-year profit outlook and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now expects adjusted pre-tax annual profit of between $325 million and $340 million, compared to $305 to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current target values are reached, that means a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in the 2011/12 period.
Managing director Graham Turner announced that Flight Centre made eight per cent profit in the first half of the year and posted a strong start to the second half of the year, particularly in Australian and UK private business.
"Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on their way towards record-breaking earnings before interest and taxes," he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest income carriers.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, making up for a slightly weaker market for business travel.
Things were doing similarly well for Flight Centre's leisure business in the UK, while business customers also spent less here.
The U.S. business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third year in a row.
Flight Centre's shares rose 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Falkenberg Discotheque makes for two great evenings
The new season at the Falkenberg discotheque "Blue Velvet" has begun.
This Friday evening it's called "Pump this party", tomorrow Saturday evening it continues with an Ü 25 party.
Fat beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days, of course.
Post barely empties on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed it yet, the red dots for Sunday emptying are still at various letterboxes of the core city and the districts, but if you read the fine print on the yellow containers of Post AG, you quickly find out that the emptying on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place," the FDP said.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, only the post office building at Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld will be emptied.
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten also Sunday is emptied, will not be answered in the answer to the question of the FDP.
The social and youth policy spokesman of the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to follow up here.
Sunday emptying is an important postal service, especially at Terminpost.
“This company is radically and unreasonably thinned out despite the price increase for letters in January 2013.”
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and City Association, supports his group colleague: "What annoys me is the fact that here secretly the emptying times are changed or even deleted".
The post office is miles away from the proximity of the citizens.
"At least the mailboxes in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten have to be emptied again on Sundays," says Bittner and Röhrenbeck in unison.
Also for the core city, especially not mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a mailbox with Sunday emptying also on foot.
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning to talk to the Post about this matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the Post Office had not communicated with Lampertheim.
To his knowledge, however, there is also a Sunday emptying in Hofheim.
Your party has advocated privatizations.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere," Maier said.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr want to go their separate ways in the future.
In an interview, however, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents to two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the split from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric, which was to be broadcast on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope."
Kerr and himself still loved each other, the 36-year-old insisted.
“We will support and love each other as parents of Flynn.”
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
Haslach: Scepticism softens confidence
With the elections to the parish council in 2015, for example, the fundamentals will change in the pastoral unit Haslach (SE).
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees from Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
Because there is nothing more to change about the fundamental decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible.
In the course of the day it became particularly clear: the skepticism towards the new gives way to a severance but increasingly.
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council, the extremely constructive discussions of the six committees with the main officials of the pastoral care team ranged.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt explained the newly adopted guidelines for pastoral units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg on the basis of a presentation.
Subsequently, the SE Haslach, as a church community, will in future form a body governed by public law, which will enter into the rights and duties of the six individual parishes.
There will be only one common parish council and one foundation council in which the pastor Kraft Amtes is represented.
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish, and so-called parish teams are formed in the six parishes.
Your task in the future will be to promote church life in the place.
When it came to the question of the finances of the individual parish, there was a considerable need for discussion.
The innovations stipulate that accumulated credits in the parishes are preserved for the purpose of being earmarked.
The liabilities, on the other hand, pass to the entire community.
Especially with regard to the large planned investments, the commitment of which then all parishes meet, there were great concerns.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested in projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone," said Haslach's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach.
Barbar Ritter, the chairwoman of the committee in the pastoral unit Schutterwald-Neuried, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
They had set themselves the task in 2006, "Become one, five stay" and had to find that this is not so easy.
The committees of the Haslach pastoral unit then set out to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council as well as the practical work of the parish teams.
The drafting will be concretised in further meetings and will be decided in a further joint meeting of all six committees next spring.
In the end, parish councillor Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the pastoral unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
Tax for foreign property owners against London's speculation bubble
The Treasury Department has provisionally calculated the CGT measure, but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7% stamp duty on apartments that cost over £2 million, as well as annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company rather than individuals.
Already, revenues from the stamp duty for residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts, which stood at £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceed revenues for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the Northeast, Northwest, Yorkshire and the Humber region combined.
Cook said: "After the increase in stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a circumvention, it is hard to claim that high-quality properties are too low taxed, notwithstanding the impact of the outdated municipal tax system."
"But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London, or stopping owners from selling," he added.
First-class properties – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, have increased in price by a record 11.8% last year.
Prices in Central London showed an even annual growth of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging "domestic market" where the southwestern part of the city, the north (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) experienced an upward trend, according to a study by Savills.
Even if the SG Achim/Baden has been without a win for four match days, the handball league continues to be in a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that at all.
Everyone is still fully motivated in the matter.
Nevertheless, I hope that we finally win again.
"Because I don't even know what such a win tastes like anymore," Malmon expects a sense of success from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Even if the third division reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn out trees, Malmon raises his index finger in advance.
I have trained many players in the A-Youth.
Therefore, they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach.
"In addition, it is important to wait and see whether there will be reinforcements from the first," explains the SG coach.
To finally get back on track for success, the Malmon team definitely needs to improve compared to previous performances.
Especially in the cover work and the switching game, it was a lot of lack of last time.
The exploitation of opportunities must also definitely get better.
Therefore, I hope that my players have finally cleared their head during the short break.
US to continue to prosecute Snowden
The U.S. has not changed its stance on former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden.
He is still accused of leaking classified information illegally.
Therefore, he must face a criminal case in the U.S., said the spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
Snowden's recent comments would not change that either.
Earlier, German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him further with punishment.
Psaki emphasized that Ströbele’s comments were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German member of the government.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign, according to the New York Times.
The unveiling is the most remarkable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times has a copy of the upcoming book and she reported Thursday night that the president's top advisers had conducted "extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011" to find out whether it would look better for Obama's dwindling hopes of re-election if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, the Times national policy correspondent, the book thoroughly traces the history of efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect it has on the poll ratings to swap former Secretary of State Clinton for the vice president.
The potential change was a tightly guarded secret within campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers -- including Daley, Obama's former campaign director, Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers, David Axelrod and David Plouffe -- knew about the planned change.
“Double Down” claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her “close, personal relationship” before eventually deciding on such a move after the data showed that Clinton’s candidacy would “not significantly improve Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I expressed a whole bunch of things to consider, and that was one of them," Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible poll ratings at the time, so we thought, “For God’s sake, what are we doing?”
While Daley described the investigations as "commanded care," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that significant effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move was paying off with regard to the ballot boxes.
“In campaigns, not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don’t seriously think about something,” Martin said.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change.
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was "aware" of the possible change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was "possible that Obama knew about it."
Martin added that "Double Down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political explorations had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the investigations into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Possible," Martin replied.
Local council happy about solid budget
Whenever municipal council meetings are about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal säckl in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known debts since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be recorded as a complete success in this sense.
This became clear when presenting the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was around €7.6 million higher than one million euros than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget, at around 1.8 million euros, is also around one million euros above the approach.
The surplus is mainly due to higher business tax revenues and the municipal share of income tax.
The wealth budget was again well above the planned values.
Instead of the planned €1.5 million, it amounted to €2.5 million last year.
"This is mainly due to the higher supply from the administrative budget," says Rothmund.
Since less investment than planned was made in the financial year 2012, the allocation of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around €2.1 million to a total of €4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You don't just shake a work like that out of your sleeve," praised Gerster with a view to the annual bill.
He and the local councils were visibly pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon be expensive.
Due to the good financial situation, the municipality has been able to do without high lifting rates in the past.
However, according to Gerster, subsidies have often been cut by the country.
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory sticks.
Among other things, the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain lifting rates.
"We have to look at the issue of lifting rates, as there will be investments in the coming years, for which we would like to have grants," Gerster announced in this context.
Geislingen: More than 100 young Catholics from the Kleiner Heuberg reaffirm their creed at the Confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old young people of the pastoral unit Am Kleinen Heuberg have been confirmed.
The church service was accompanied in the morning by the group Laudato-Si, in the afternoon the youth choir The Spirit.
With the reception of the firm sacrament, the young people said yes to their baptism and requested the power of the Holy Spirit.
The Firmlings had prepared for the big feast day in recent months, under the direction of deacon Reiner Dehner and the help of numerous parishioners.
In various projects, they learned about various tasks of Christian community life and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal together.
Desperation of an Obama voter
I voted President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible
He says Obama has made commendable efforts that had been thwarted by Republicans' blockade tactics
The blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare's website problems, the drone strikes
Obama's memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am currently reading a terribly sad book.
It's a book I thought would cheer me up during the murky second year of my medical studies and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama on the 2008 presidential election.
When I’m done with my patient records in the evening and going to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take their breath away from a speech.
The election became a landslide victory and news anchors paused to show the historical significance of that hour.
My classmates cried with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama moved into office in 2008, he had 82% approval ratings.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is a rude awakening, as if you are being ripped out of a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem like a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just nothing I could have imagined.
I acknowledge the great and multifaceted things Obama has achieved, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the Army and the killing of Osama bin Laden.
I, too, am of the view that the partisan blockade tactics have overturned too many aspirations to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public option for health insurance, and closing down Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances, I have come to an end with my attempts to explain.
I have reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why one allows the eavesdropping of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are being punished who expose state misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential election.
It does not justify the findings of a report that said the White House’s efforts to immobilize the media are the “most aggressive since the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if that's what I should have expected.
Whether I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that it was going beyond.
Obviously, the deputies' office is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape public discussion.
But when I look at the above examples, they seem to be largely elected by the government itself.
And that bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unsophisticated alternative, he did not seem to be able to set his direction and positions.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with the decline in approval ratings for Obama to below 45% this week, the return to 2008 through this book has become all the harder.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved into air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to take a heavy loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
In a meeting with the election workers after the decision, he told his staff they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
“I want us to find our magic again,” he said.
We have to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree with you any stronger.
The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
Constance: Closure after accident at the Schänzlekreisel
According to the police, the accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss Seat Ibiza drove out of town on Thursday evening, around 8 p.m., in the left lane of the two-lane Reichenaustraße.
Shortly before the roundabout at the Schänzle, he noticed that he was in the left turn lane in the direction of Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right lane.
This resulted in a collision with the BMW of a 23-year-old Konstanzer.
Also damaged was the VW Passat of a 19-year-old driving behind the BMW.
A total of around 15000 property damage was incurred, police said.
The roadway had to be closed during the accident, it said.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is becoming more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf have to adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of Stadtwerke, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to the SÜDKURIER, a four-member Pfullendorf family will receive 70 to 90 euros in additional costs per year.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG surcharge from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour.
This surcharge is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
These quantify the additional costs incurred by them from the energy transition, which they can charge through a surcharge above the price of electricity.
The municipal utilities Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The Supervisory Board of the energy company had even assumed a higher surcharge in its forecasts, as Jörg-Arne Bias reports.
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the municipal utilities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week.
"We expect an increase of 1 cent plus x," says Bias, with the number rather close to the 2 cents.
Josef Winkler has been writing the hardships of his childhood and adolescence from the soul for more than 30 years.
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the speechlessness, the tendency to raw violence and dull sexuality, the narrowness and joylessness - has been described many times by the Carinthian poet.
The Büchner Prize winner is best known as a prose writer, theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prose texts for his performance "Wetterleuchten auf der Zungenspitze", which can now be seen in Garage X on St. Peter's Square.
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigen" (1987) with prosaminatures from "Leichnam, seine Familie belauernd" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - important prop: a crumpled sofa on which is insinuatedly copulated and masturbated - the eight-piece ensemble sways through the text material.
Director Fresacher seems to trust the text little.
The 70-minute performance covered the template with a wealth of directorial ideas, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
Especially the actresses come to the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations.
They are touched hard, dipped with their head under water, stapled with their evening robes on the wall.
Conquered in cellophane or bodice, they stagger on dangerously high heels through the production, either monologue loudly or lie completely silent on the stage floor.
However, the text hardly conveys itself in this strickened way.
The evening has the best moments when singing - the range ranges from Deep Purple to folk song.
Only towards the end does the overwrought performance come to rest somewhat, and Winkler's straight absurd humor flashes up.
Basketball: The hope of the Neckar giants grows
The chances of the league remaining of the sportingly relegated Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players have increased.
Because if there is a wildcard procedure, then there is now one less competitor for the Neckar giants.
The basketball project Hamburg Towers waives an application for a possible follow-up place.
"We will not participate in the wildcard procedure," said ex-national player Pascal Roller, who has been setting up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city since 2012.
Nevertheless, a first breath of relief was not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the wildcard procedure until it is clear that Düsseldorf does not receive a license," Neckar giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
Until the 23. May can still submit Düsseldorf Baskets documents to the ruling court and prove his economic Bundesliga suitability.
So far, the Rhinelanders have been denied the license twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the last resort.
