The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new prime minister, Narendra Modi, meets his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first important foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to consolidate economic relations with the world's third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
According to reports, India is also hoping for a treaty to cooperate against defence between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old after fast motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic police officers in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it as it left a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued to drive on Burgess Road before turning off into the bushland, where officers lost sight of it.
The motorcycle, as well as a person who corresponded to the driver's description, were later seen at a house in Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Karratha police accuse a 20-year-old man of non-observance of a stop signal as well as reckless driving.
He's supposed to be on 23. September appear before the district court in Karratha.
The motorcycle was secured and seized for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rapes in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for the rape of women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out the indictment at a hearing by the Glasgow High Court.
He's accused on 7. Raped a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Perthshire in Perthshire in June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, unable to signal consent."
Webster is also accused of the 4th. May 2014 a second woman raped at the Golf View Hotel in Naim in the Scottish highlands.
Judge Lady Rae set the trial date for the 17th November at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labour rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have put forward a bill to establish the organization of unions as a civil right.
"Just as unions die, the middle-class jobs are also dying," said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I proudly present the Employee Authorization Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options for discrimination on the basis of the organization of trade unions as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-union-minded forces.
The addition of the national employment law to create a possibility for workers facing discrimination to organize a trade union representation in order to sue for justice in a civil court - and to receive damages or penalty payments - is a sensible and necessary initiative.
But it's certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors are suggesting to their bill is the connection back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and comply with labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right of association in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac encouraged Arthur and his staff to pass a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware of the fact that the workers and their unions took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly acknowledged that "the rights of workers to unification and joint negotiation and action are guaranteed."
When the United States occupies Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism would be replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would have to organize themselves, and should raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans inserted a clause that explicitly testified: "The right to set up associations to secure and improve the working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or trade.
Agreements that restrict or aim to reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a worldwide agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors inserted a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect their interests."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to establish a trade union - and that this union should then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with companies and government agencies - must be protected.
After these rights came under fire in America, it is indeed very wise to revisit the American ideal, according to which the working population must have the right to unite and make themselves heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions of people, work has miraculously created a market for industry, raising the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack the work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
The story remembers, and we should do that.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have made America great in the past and redeemed the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily halts law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday provisionally halted the implementation of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say would have presumably led to the closure of all five of the state's abortion clinics.
This measure, which was elevated to law by Bobby Jindal, governor of Louisiana, in June and on the 1. Sept. is to come into force, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admissions right at a hospital within a 30-mile radius around their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to perform legal abortions for the time being while requesting such a right.
"The plaintiffs may continue to work in accordance with the law while seeking to obtain these rights," federal judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
Within a month, a hearing will be scheduled for the judge to bring about a more permanent decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of rulings against similar measures, saying that so doctors would gain more time to gain hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that the women in Louisiana are escaping a devious law that wants to deprive them of their health and their rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chairwoman of the Center for Reproduction Rights, which had sued on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to halt the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the verdict also extended to the doctors from the two clinics, who had not joined the lawsuit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have enacted similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures in Alabama and Mississippi to be unconstitutional.
Key points of a Texas law that would have forced most of the clinics remaining in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that admission rights from doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Abortion opponents counter that the measures serve to protect women's health, though some also welcomed the impact of a closure of clinics.
Only a doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient credit rights, the Center for Reproduction Rights said.
If all the rest of the doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would no longer perform the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the ruling, representatives of the state of Louisiana said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions, while their requests for patient admission rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher death rates from ovarian cancer in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their mother online, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
For women in rural areas of Australia, there is a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australian women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
SMALL STUDY: New medicines could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers examined the women's medical care over seven years of age.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age in diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing conditions, and social and economic status also affected the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already more advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the mortality risk during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not look at why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan a late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for it.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of telemedicine services in order to counteract the distances, she proposed as a possible remedy a strengthening of the service of flown-in doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women more close to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed a poor long-term survival rate in women in ovarian cancer, regardless of geographical status, and underlined the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33, learned from the Gold Coast that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centres regret falling homeowner numbers
The decline, along with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could result in garden centres losing tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "nuclear age group for garden products," according to a study by the HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with home spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular procedure of paving front yards for park purposes and the declining garden size are other factors that threaten the industry, in which an estimated £5 billion annually in sales are implemented.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 to 43 per cent over a period of 6 years, the lowest expenditure on garden products per household is reported.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens does not mean that people cannot draw plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them on a move."
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeowner numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-90s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year because of the better weather after unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and clergyman Tahirul Qadri, continues.
In the capital, Islamabad, around 1000 protesters have stormed the state-run PTV station.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings again.
The station ceased operations for around 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, around 3000 protesters tried to get to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence.
About a kilometer away from it, they fought clashes with security forces equipped with sticks and stones.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but he rejects it.
The country's army, meanwhile, calls for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and using it without violence."
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday night, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already covered more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Premier Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary election in May last year.
The protests had escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to advance to Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey sells US diplomat over spy report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the longest-serving U.S. diplomat in the country to provide information on a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the U.S. Embassy's business official and Turkish officials had discussed the report Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel, as well as the online magazine The Intercept, reported that those of the former US analyst of the National Security Agency, Edward Snowden, show that Turkey was a major area of activity for the US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan downplayed the importance of the report, saying that all the major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that Germany’s main intelligence service also had Ankara in its sights caused significantly more angry reactions from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: Locomotive drivers face consequences for commuters
The nationwide warning strike of the locomotive drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The withdrawal announced for 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. nationwide affects all transport companies, including long-distance, regional and S-Bahn traffic,
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.

The district chairman of the German Locomotive Union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main thrust of the warning strike is freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it wanted to strike, so it was difficult to foresee the consequences in concrete terms.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
The prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the Mallorca prosecutor on Friday.
The chief of Calvià's police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after corruption allegations by businessmen and bar owners in the infamous Binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was taken into custody after allegations of corruption against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs lie.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of extortion by police and employees of the city of Calvià to the office of the prosecutor for the fight against corruption in Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the corruption allegations and are questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The national Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners testified that the nepotism of the authorities had a serious impact on their business.
"It's no longer about making money, it's about survival," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our livelihood out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing on 24 men during a drinking tour Fellatio.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the improper behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the notorious alcohol-soaked pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fellation incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organizer Carnage must jointly pay a penalty of €55,000 (73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, which is particularly popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather conditions is affecting flights from Adelaide Airport
The SPRING has given South Australia a wintry surprise, with heavy showers and strong winds affecting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 9 p.m. another 5mm rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy showers, including a cast that began just before 8 p.m. and provided nearly 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After winter provided for an early dose of spring last week, temperatures in the city fell again to a high of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The gusty weather conditions have likely led to the delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane should have landed shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a shear wind - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Winds reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at the time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing approach and finally set off at about 20.40.
The flight delay subsequently led to the delay of some other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is predicted to have a maximum temperature of 16°C on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says: High time for great networking
In view of the galloping technical progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech control panels, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforting himself with a highly familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, my gaze falls on the spiral cable that connects the receiver to the phone, and I think: Boah, how retro is that?
But there is a consideration behind it: If the cable were not, all the listeners would fly around the house without a master in the short time, and that would be significantly more retro.
In any case, the ekeltronic (ecletronic?
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that today's world first is the e-waste of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And who still has a tube TV in the living room today, for example, only says that he rejects television in principle.
Why these considerations?
Because the urging of the Ifa at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in questions of electronics.
The layman, who used to blindly master washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread out with incredibly vain expert talk before him: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Yeah, can you still do it?
What should we talk about with people who apparently voluntarily spread such quark?
Basically, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about us to network our house as much as possible.
So that the yogurt itself can order, so that the fire alarm informs us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we got the air conditioning from the office on our early arrival ...?
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream will definitely come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, say "Suck!" - and at home the robot vacuum cleaner drives off.
Crazy.
It all boils down to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blur," whispers an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steamer sends the weather report and the data glasses indicate how long the pizza still needs in the oven, but this is of no use because we are in traffic jams.
In addition, we know from the daily practice: If a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the phone will also survive the next radio exhibitions.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters, while rocket and mortar shelling on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, shutting down schools in Gaza while the area recovered from the fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities marked by rocket bullet holes in southern Israel, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident at Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher there.
Many children from our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt "a bit weird" about suddenly going back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we didn't leave the house at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke out last week's war, thousands of residents of the border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the border with Gaza where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant with the return.
The Department of Education said about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Their children were provisionally housed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza that is heavily marked by Palestinian shelling.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said "we will make sure that their knowledge acquires and offers you security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire caused an immediate end to the fighting; however, important problems remain unresolved, such as Hamas's call for a lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.
Israel is calling for a disarmament of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt later this month.
In the war, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel disputes this information and estimates that at least half of those killed are fighters, but did not provide any concrete evidence of this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other militants in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza area and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in the shelters and the fighting continues, education authorities last week postponed the start of the school year.
"I hope the school is open again soon so we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After election in Saxony: CDU deputy Strobl questions NPD ban procedure
In view of the loss of votes of the NPD in Saxony, CDU deputy Thomas Strobl has advocated an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU Federal Deputy Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should come to an end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD scores worse than last time," Strobl, who is also CDU's head of state in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipziger Volkszeitung newspaper.
This is a pleasing development in the right direction and a development that makes me rather come to the conclusion that the NPD is being politically opposed and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had failed very narrowly at the five percent hurdle in Sunday's vote.
A first attempt for a ban on the far-right party had failed in 2003, because the constitutional protection at the time also had informants in the NPD leadership.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe after a long preparation.
The federal government and the Bundestag did not join.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At Neuländer Platz, refugees are now being housed in tents.
The central initial reception for refugees in Harburg is bursting at the seams.
Now the Interior Department has put three Red Cross tents next to it.
District politicians were only informed shortly before - they are little enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions continue to fuel reservations of the citizens and do not give the district politicians any opportunity to participate constructively in the humane accommodation of refugees," says Britta Herrmann, parliamentary group leader of the Greens in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party is demanding that the district administration of Harburg currently provide unused homes for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the initial reception are the onslaught of those seeking help - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough places in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
House prices have seen the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for home ownership in the Australian capital rose 1.1 per cent in August, according to Monday's RP data.
As a result of this increase, the overall increase in June, July and August is 4.2 percent, the biggest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly spread across the country.
RP Data's research leader, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are powering a two-part market.
RP Data figures show that Sydney home prices rose by 16.1 per cent last year, while in Melbourne it rose by 11.7 per cent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six per cent respectively.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices have risen by only 1.4 per cent over the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the start of spring, there would now be an increase in the properties for sale for the next few months, which would subject the market to "a real test."
"If you look at the constantly high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate and the constantly low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise even further in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts statements by the managing director Peer Medau and attests to this, "like a general" to pose.
The style of the university is not, the statement said.
For example, the Medau family had already been "orally informed in mid-June about the idea of the university.
The statement that the plans only became known in July is definitely wrong," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not "pre-determinations or even decisions", but there are "preferences".
The extension of the narrow road up to the castle, which is necessary for the access road, is also less dramatic than feared by the Medaus.
There was and is no mention of a nine-meter-wide road.
According to the current status, it is about 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before," explains Pötzl.
Pötzl does not want to accept the argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-specific parking areas will only be used by students of the university in the future.
It is not parked at all, because this can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Thinking of the residents
The mountain micraft, which is located on the premises and on the doorstep of which would lead along the driveway to the parking deck, should "not be affected," according to the university president.
Rather, he points out "that this is not only about the nursery, but also about the residents at the junction with Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring secondary school.
So it's about much more than about particular interests of Mr. Medau," says Pötzl.
Whether the criticism of the parent advisory board of the crèche, with the expansion of the road would be entitled to one "of the few natural spots of Coburg" is justified, "the reader himself can decide".
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Construction Office, intends to inform the city councils about the structural development of the university until 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the nursery about the plans of the university last week.
Accordingly, the access for the new parking deck should not lead as before over the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, but over the Medau mountain.
Thus, the narrow road would have to be extended in two lanes over a length of about one kilometer.
According to projections of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Hohenfels Castle would increase tenfold.
There is talk of about 2000 vehicles a day.
So far, the city has not wanted to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from handball national team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from Bundesliga side SG Flensburg-Handewitt cited health problems for this decision.
The decision was not easy for me, it has matured over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team," the 2007 world champion shared on his Facebook page.
He thus retires with a record of 167 international matches and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the powerful back room player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go on goal chasing for a few more years, he is now no longer available to the new national coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who announces his squad for the international matches against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf had a "long and good conversation.
I was just as enthusiastic about his ideas and approaches as my long-time teammates and my successors will inspire me.
But for my club I would like to be healthy in the next few years, but longer regeneration breaks are necessary, which the current double burden does not allow.
The left-hander had to fear his career end in 2012 after a heel infection.
Because of Achilles tendon problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone syringe, which had later triggered a strong inflammation.
An emergency surgery and two other procedures followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career do not pass without a trace on any body.
I have some health construction sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries, which were performed at short intervals in 2012, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
In addition, there are some other wear-related complaints.
At the beginning of the year, I realized that although I can control my head, I can't fool my body," Glandorf explained in an interview to the magazine "Handball Time".
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the ropes tear, I'm always ready to talk," the father-of-two explained to the trade magazine.
However, I can count the years in which I can still play handball on one hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I also got quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I want to be able to walk at least reasonably straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Championship title and winning the Champions League in 2014, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup Winners' Cup with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2 percent in spring
The crises around the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross domestic product fell 0.2 percent from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was announced by the Federal Statistical Office and thus confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone revived the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
Thanks to the strong start to the year, the GDP overall increase of 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013 was achieved for the first half of the year.
Horstmar was the starting point and the finish of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led for the first time through the Burgmannsstadt on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar experienced an invasion of Dutch "Fietzenfahrer" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organized the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the biggest bike tour across the Münsterland, the cyclist paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland with their registration.
This tour was offered to interested parties in various trade journals.
We come from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would also like to get to know the Münsterland in this way," the cyclists were happy about the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registration in the club home of the Schützenbrüderschaft Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace ride" through the city over the wall, where the start also took place.
The route, which was advertised for three different categories, continued in the direction of Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and via Havixbeck and Billerbeck back to Horstmar.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 meters of altitude, 120 kilometers with 1475 vertical meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 vertical meters, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were catered for on the way in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Main organizer Jos ter Huerne and mayoral deputy Heinz Lölfing were very pleased about the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a nice experience for everyone involved.
The organization went without any problems and there were no negative incidents," Heinz Lölfing draws a positive conclusion of this event.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will see you again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on the 30. August or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to come back to Münsterland and the organizers are planning a new edition.
Konstantin Wecker's ruthlessly honest memoir
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-container, in "Mönch und Krieger" put on paper on 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more scraps of thought for scraps of thought have the one on 1. Born in June 1947, Munich wrote down his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable lyrics.
And he is ruthlessly honest: From the Onanie as a high school student to shoplifting and drug use, he does not leave out any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow human beings.
Broad space also takes up abstract but all the more important terms: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality - all this he tries to get to the bottom, in a very philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and also how not only music has shaped him (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician), but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the man-of-liver Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "through subtraction," as he says, "by omitting everything unnecessary."
Between all the high-spirited views, however, there are also short anecdotes on earth: for example, about brawls in a restaurant frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, during which he frontally targeted a tree.
He is also relentlessly honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in my arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children of a family of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with lively tunes.
But Henry had to work his way through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice: "Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Get moving!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a kid - went to the pub with him and talked about things, like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket strike.
I never had a conversation like that with him.
Much of my life he was this serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than at his father’s time, he gained insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little brighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deep stygical labyrinths with bursts of flame and smoke and plenty of soot.
My father used to just lie down in the tub and then you could slowly hear him start singing because he could wash the foundry of himself.
As I walked around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew bigger.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without his parents' love testimonies.
My father never embraced me, he never said "I love you."
It was only when my mother was feeling bad towards the end of her life that we began to say "I love you, I love you, I love you."
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Could you stop "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
It's still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to do a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may show up in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been captured by the theatre.
It was followed By The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
That's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started at just 16 when he was working in a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage when he imitated people and wrote about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-seventies. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on TV for a fairly long time."
He learned in his profession.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, but I also had to learn from 1975 to 1985 how I could become an efficient joke-narrative machine while I was a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 on New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage right to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "painted each other black," Henry listed his comedy there for over five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I kind of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did.
It was a strange, awkward position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "years-long award-winning light pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
By introducing figures who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the Eighties.
The first row of the Lenny Henry Show went on air in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV series and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought to himself: "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just bringing the time around or kicking a little on the spot."
After that came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was predominantly a middle-class domain, whites in tights and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of that.
All those we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said "You should try it.
Don't make it bad if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few of the words in your mouth, and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines from Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally put their heads on me.
"That's what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be expecting a car accident, and that just didn't happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical error and Henry instinctively felt that he had to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, "You have to bridge for 10 minutes now while they're fixing the computer.""
Instead, the stage director announced that the performance would continue once the problem was solved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You're playing in a play, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, this strengthens the tendons.
This, too, was well received, so it is like a great shield of the gods who tell me, "This is your destiny."
He says this, of course, with a THUNDERING voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I really love that.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry, however, still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is criss-crossed by humorous outbursts while he repeatedly imitates individuals.
I've decided not to do a stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant satisfaction from a hall full of strangers is somehow dangerous.
If you always look for this, you drive with it in front of a wall.
I sometimes perform live in the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall it doesn't give me as much as it used to.
I'm asking him if he'll ever do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director that helps form a beginning, a middle part and the end of a journey - I don't think I ever want to give that up again.
So is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital, Sanaa.
Houthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party said "Ansar Allah."
Access to the parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media report traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post newspaper, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi had called for the measures on Sunday evening.
Houthi threatened, according to the paper, with a further escalation of the conflict should its demands not be met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for more independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and are calling for the government's resignation.
The people of the Houthi have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Around 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the large access roads of Sanaa.
In the surrounding area, there are always bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to contain 'ghost employees'
Kenya has begun to biometrically register all state officials to delete "ghost employees" from the government's payrolls.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government announcement read.
The government suspects that thousands of people will still receive salary payments even after their departure from the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta promised to fight corruption in the public service when he took office in 2013.
At an audit earlier this year, it was found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost to payments for "ghost employees" and through other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects salaries will continue to be paid out in accounts after a person has died or is leaving public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports for the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure their data on the biometric registrations are recorded, a government message was shared.
All those who would not do so without a credible apology would be removed from the payroll, the notice went on to say.
"This approach contributes significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants and also clearing the payroll at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "ghost employees," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding the art consultant Helge Achenbach will take place on 11. November trial for the first time in court.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings, in a civil case at the Düsseldorf Regional Court.
A court spokeswoman said on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and classic cars and that Berthold Albrecht calculated higher than actually paid purchase prices.
As a result, the agreed commission was also higher.
Achenbach had bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of them as headmaster.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many confessed Petershausener and Kollbacher from their time as a student.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always sustained by his aspiration to see man in the student.
The Schneekoppe is the most famous mountain of the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motif from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau/North Bohemia, today Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he was already interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
One year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a warehouse, it was in 1946 to Bavaria - in the freight wagon.
So it took Richter to the Upper Franconian town of Senkendorf.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
For this purpose, Manfred Richter had to walk ten kilometers six times a week to the nearest station, take the train to Bamberg, go to school there three kilometers across the city and back in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter got a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: along with up to 15 classmates in a dormitory.
In 1951 he made the first and in 1954 after three years of teacher trainees the second state examination.
Since Upper Franconia did not have a vacant teacher position for him, he applied to Upper Bavaria and came on 1. November 1954 to the school in Kollbach.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958, he moved into a three-room service apartment in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980 after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were summarized in Petershausen in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf School Association was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
In order to avoid a downgrade in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
But Petershausen grew, and so from September 1982 the children and their teachers were able to move into the current building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who had a work room built at the city's expense and at the extension in 1997 basement rooms, although this was not eligible for school buildings according to the guidelines.
"Mayor Götz was very school-friendly," Richter recalled gratefully.
In his entire career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech by a government representative who had responded to a presentation by a school board on law and justice: "One must never forget love." Manfred Richter implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings," says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to know: "That doesn't always succeed". Whether he only means his students or his own six children is not entirely clear.
In any case, Richter's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students fought, they did not get a criminal work from him and were not thundered to detention.
At the expense of the municipality, Richter had two pairs of boxing gloves bought and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violet.
For the benefit of the school, Richter, as rector, maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
He moved the non-party judge after his retirement to at least be the last on the CSU list for the local council in 1996.
However, Richter was pre-elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make stopovers in the spa park of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
When cyclists take a rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scots, this is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, the number of resting people made an impression: The 700 participants of the hr4 bike tour including the escorts enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Schottener Alteburgpark.
Under the motto "Cycling and celebrating on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig" the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: The cyclists tackled the first stage, the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
To refresh the body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: The rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, plum, crumble and cheesecake, which mouthed the capable cyclists wonderfully.
"Such cakes can only bake rural women," praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
At the drink stand of the gymnastics club Geiß-Nidda, cold refreshments could be purchased.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful ambience of the park seemed relaxing.
A gentleman also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserves it, after all, he has already reattached bicycle chains that have already jumped off today".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the plant manager still had to work: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the drinking spa by reporter Rainer Janke and took the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
Even promotion boss Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4 bike tour in 2004 as a tour guide, could only take a snap, he had to deal with the technology on site.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated with his staff and the 15-member motorcycle squadron of the Hesse police, wrote Facebook entries and did reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants come from the Rhine-Main area," he said, "but also from Giessen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends a bit on the available accommodation capacities.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodation.
From the spa town, the cyclists had a good impression when they set off again after an hour and a half: "Bye!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Scots, the group was allowed to take a short breather.
But in the evening, the cyclists were challenged in the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the direction of the Schottener Gesellschaft für Tourismus und Stadtmarketing (GTS), the park had received a beautiful festive ambience and of course one had prepared treats, such as flambées with well-cooled feather whitener.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs welcomed the visitors in his role as a member of the Board of Management of the ADAC Hessen-Thuringia.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scots."
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporty activity on the bike.
Among the guests, citizens were increasingly mixed, who were just as impressed by the good mood as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwalders - were on the program for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes arrived back in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for 'conspiracy' against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government," local media agencies report.
Police authorities made no immediate comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in the corruption investigations against government employees, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policemen were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tapping phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was prime minister at the time) described her actions as part of the activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1. September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
Heaven is not peaceful everywhere over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian Popular Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavyansk, who visits Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here again and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated, with children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She arrives with a proud trail of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own front experience.
Her career began with the global management consulting firm Bain and Co., whereupon she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the parent company's top post, Pearsons, went to a younger male colleague.
Her severance payment was reportedly almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May I described the chairman's job with a poisoned chalice.
Not only does the BBC stand as a huge and complex unit at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inwardly on the first guard of one's own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also outwardly as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
That makes for an almost untenable duopoly, which calls for a complete comprehensive reform.
But which newly arriving chairwoman would risk competing, hitting everything and taking apart an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking himself for his job.
It's a difficult task.
And as if that weren't enough, many are also still interested in seeing the BBC downsized - power, money and status outdated.
As competition approaches and new technologies threaten old, convenient collateral, the upcoming negotiation of royalties for the BBC is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 per cent of all households and costs each of them only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is rising again on the popularity scale: 53 per cent support it today, compared to 31 per cent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone these days and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very beloved and considerable institution.
She needs a considerable chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that disparaging tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas' Republican governor, Rick Perry, on Sunday included a disparaging remark about the Democratic district attorney, which is at the center of a criminal charge against him for abuse of authority.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another from Perry's account that denied the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't approve of the tweet and deleted it," the later message read.
Perry staff did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets were made by Perry’s official user account, it was not clear who was actually serving the feed.
In the earlier tweet, an unfavorable picture was drawn by Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment of Perry - who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple allowable alcohol level ... but when I do, I sue Governor Perry when he talks it out."
I'm the most drunken Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with the leadership of the grand jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was selected by a Republican judge.
Perry pleads not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-class team of legal counsel petitioned the judge charged with the case, who dismissed the indictment, arguing that the law against the longest-serving governor in the history of the state of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million of state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigating in cases of state corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint on the part of a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official account is frequently updated - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth at the Iowa election meetings during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry addressed speculation that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market 'normal' again
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in the south-east of England had "returned" back to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and subject to huge rises in prices, which led the Bank of England to set caps on mortgage loans in June due to widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chief executive of high-class construction firm Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since peaking in 2013" adding that this provided a "stable environment for action."
The property market in London was well-positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to information from the cadastral office, prices in the urban area have jumped by 18.5 per cent in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales overall.
Average selling prices at Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year, up £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made property ownership in London less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of which have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric over a possible "villa tax" ahead of next May's general election.
London-based real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the mortgage market report for April, which presented tougher lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England from Monday shows a decline in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests that the property market is cooling.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, revised its forecast for the 2015 rise in housing prices in London down to 3 per cent, based on an already weakening house price awareness.
Transaction volume in the most expensive areas of London such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now declined by a quarter year after year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Still, the desire for a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley as the amounts due for schedule sales amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, futures sales have also remained stable."
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - nearly a third more than at the peak in 2007 before the crisis.
Annual pre-tax earnings rose by 40 percent annually to 280 million. £, sales up 18 per cent to £1.6bn.
In a notice Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said revenues for Berkeley in the current year would likely meet current market expectations.
The analysts estimate the annual pre-tax result at 450 million. £.
Berkeley shares stood firm in London trading at £23.96 in afternoon trading.
Jennifer Lawrence nude photos posted on the Internet by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence performs at the 85. Oscars.
Nude photos of Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of pictures of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that Lawrence's photos were genuine and charged the hacker with "blatant invasion of privacy."
Authorities have been notified and will track all those who continue to post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing page 4chan were allegedly procured by a gap in Apple's iCloud online storage system. The alleged "master list" of hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star from "Scott Pilgrim against the Rest of the World" also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who look at photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house - I hope you are really happy with you," Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice from the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied, however, that the photos were pictures of her and tweeted "These so-called nude pictures of me are FAKED, folks.
Let's just fight the beginnings. *Play of words intended*.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J."
They flowed, so you could best describe it, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard box, which you left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant and perhaps a little scratchy-to-earth.
And then shook his hand.
He knew scratchy.
He was prickly, like in hedgehogs, yeah.
The last victim of this spike was an just beginning affair, which had been more promising for a relief of the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a fluttering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rougher than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an elderly escort who Kevern thought was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a damp but paradise valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
No one had lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, there were still spiders in the baths, slugs had left their mark on all the windows and believed that they owned all this, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had sat with Ailinn holding hands on the broken deckchairs in the tall grass and enjoyed an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had latched on absent-mindedly into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to with closed shutters in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was really forbidden - just not played.
It was successfully obsolesced, just as the word obsolesce.
The general taste created what decrees and regulations would never have managed, and how people in books choose the vom-platewasher-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and romance novels, so they chose the ballads at the music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing in a coarse-comic serenade of Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
His father had always done so to stop the letter J before he came out of his mouth.
It had started as a game between him and his father when he was still young.
His father had played it with his own father, so he had told.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it will cost you a penny.
It hadn't been a very fun game back then, and it wasn't very funny even now.
He knew this was expected of him, that was all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of any.
Jazz, even if it was not directly banned, was not played.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be quite sure at the beginning of a tune where it would end.
Likewise the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was musically expressed mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's half-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or constraints applied.
A compliant society meant that every element of this society gratefully agreed to the principle of group talent - gratefully as those spared from fate.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suitable for entertainment and sports through temperament and physique, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed with electronic talent as if by nature and were assisted with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a functioning service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewer; what was left of the Greeks, Teller smashed.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant, whose grandparents had not left the country quickly than WHAT HAD Happened, IF IT HAD Happened, for fear of being charged with fire-shoning, for fear even that the flames would consume them next - had opened Labneh and Shisha pipe restaurants, kept themselves in mind and became depressed with the inaction
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be set to music.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the huge cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't get it.
Why would your father have loved this?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She already thought he was a little strange.
"It seemed funny to him," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief and blocked Kevern's view.
There was nothing else to see around the world than her uncombed raven-black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
"If you say it," they mean without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed honestly worried.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet so directly not.
Maybe your ankles, a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you," but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you," he tried instead.
I'm a little perverse.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be weird.
When he tried to be weird, he often got himself into trouble because, like his father, he didn't have the soothing charm you needed to tame the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, wanted to be that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and rose from her deckchair, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had drunk.
Elderberry blossom wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her arousal, she seemed to be shaking, like palm fronds in the storm.
"And your dickhead is exactly why I'm perversely attracted to you," she said.
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that appeared in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubts that it was essentially the same as here.
The same huge and freezing ocean broke here as there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more dreadful of WHAT HAD Happened when their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or smashed them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she wasn't careful!
They first make out - hicking was the most commonly used word for an erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the meaningless love ballads from the console - they first snuck and then beat.
In Kevern's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the sniffing itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He rose from the deckchair like an old man.
She also felt leaden, but the force of his grief surprised her.
That was not the end of the world.
You barely knew each other.
She watched him as he left - just as from a room on the upper floor her companion watched him - a man, complained of something he himself had conjured up.
Adam leaves the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against them.
A man turned away from her, his back bowed, shamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well when she could not remember once, when she had already seen something like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
Several years before the incidents just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for the public mood, worked on a short lecture on the continued violence at low and medium level in exactly the parts of the country in which their reduction, if not abolition, were most likely to be expected, in view of the funds and energy that were invested in the out
"A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done," she wrote, "to appease the innate aggressiveness of a people who fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the towering steeples between the hedges.
But some properties turn out to be ineradicable.
The higher the steeple, it seems, the lower the passion it continues to arouse.
The population weeps when listening to sentimental ballads, intoxicated by stories of overcome difficulties and claims to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the former rawness hold the rural communities as well as our urban structures firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and sneaky struggle at home, in the workplace, on the streets and even on the playing fields.
"They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate," her mentor said when he read the full report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme walnut tree lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and denial of testimony.
Feminist?
Silence again.
"I don't ask that," Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbenism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free job.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity that are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable may occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the Church, and these things, which you describe as "devious" and "rude," might as well be interpreted by others as an expression of a natural power and vitality.
If you continue to ride around what HAS Happened, IF IT HAS Happened, as if it had happened, it would have happened yesterday means taking away the country's essential vitality.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, an LED lettering in Flamingorosa repeated the advice That Ofnow had given the country in the last quarter century or for more.
Smile at their neighbor, appreciate their partner, listen to ballads, visit musicals, use their phone, speak, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written one, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want to get to," Esme Nussbaum replied in a calm voice, when she was sure that her superior had finished speaking, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet as effectively healed as we ourselves are.
My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves repeating how we repeat the mistakes that have happened in the first place, WHEN IT HAS Happened.
This time, however, it is not the others where we leave out our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To indicate an angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you call actions a "mistake" that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You also go too far if you talk about these having left out their "anger" and their "distrust" of "others."
It should actually not be necessary to remind someone in your position that we speak of "us" and "others" when understanding the past as if in protecting the present.
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From who, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme ventured, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened, has happened.
That was then.
Nothing needs to be said about that anymore - we agree on that.
And just as no guilt has to be assigned, so no guilt must be repaid if such an eradication were appropriate and if there were a way to pay off it.
But what serves the past if we don't learn from it -
The past is to forget it.
If I may say something about it -
Luther Rabinowitz let his pyramid collapse.
"I will consider their report," he said, sacking her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was run over by a motorcyclist who, as passers-by described, had driven onto the footpath in a kind of "brutal anger."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister stays in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were cracking down on police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said the country's army had surrounded his office and occupied government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to adjacent South Africa after reporting on assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was de facto no coup, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" whose armament was imminent by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements were acting within the police that actually wanted to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had given the impression of a coup.
"Even though no one has claimed to have seized the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of the Lesotho Defense Forces have so far shown signs of a coup," he said.
Spokesmen for the Lesotho military said Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the governance during Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been great tension in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the clashes in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite accusations of otherwise.
Production in the eurozone at a 13-month low
The increase in production in the eurozone slowed to the lowest point of the past 13 months in August, according to a closely watched study with.
The final Markit Purchasing Managers' Index of the manufacturing sector (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, up from a level of 51.8 in July.
An indication of more than 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced slumps at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures arrive ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan to deal with a hesitant recovery from the eurozone, as well as for the looming deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further details later this week on whether he is considering quantitative relief for the eurozone, according to those made by Britain and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the customing impact of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties has become clearer for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economic nation, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as does Italy's relegation from solid expansion to stagnation.
Indications that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, no longer apply are also not reassuring," Mr Dobson said.
The decline in industry is presumably fuelling the fire of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
Positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economics expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say for the manufacturing industry's purchasing managers index in the eurozone from August is that the sector continues to grow after that."
He added: "Producers in the eurozone are obviously finding life quite difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - are widening uncertainties in the continuing difficult conditions in many countries.
These heightened uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - particularly, and consumer confidence, and presumably leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, particularly large-scale orders.
He said it was becoming "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to initiate a type of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The Hell Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children involved still suffer today.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We have returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the appalling siege of the school of Beslan, in which 334 people perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatic Islamist terrorists children and parents on 1. September 2004, the beginning of a new school year, captured and killed, seemed like the evil of evil.
The tragedy united West and East into revulsion, and then surprisingly turned into plot and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will persecute them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now haunting Ukraine - and in which children like them die - is now coming to an end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the shattered school sports hall
She was photographed and famous by Russian star photographer Dimitri Beliakov when she tried only in her underwear to climb back into the shattered school sports hall after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't," Aida said at the time.
My legs were bloodied.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
One soldier took her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she considered herself completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I'm afraid I need surgery again.
Some shrapnel are still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people, as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says combatively.
"That happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year I always go to the sports hall to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I are trying not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too great.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory becomes a little weaker every year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself climbing back to school online, I think that many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help ensure that something like this doesn't happen again.
The boy who fled through the hail of bullets, in the opinion that his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at the age of 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
As a seven-year-old, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and holding her hand."
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearful that she could be dead, he fled and saw a crying toddler on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a hail of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who locked his son outside in his arms, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In reality, Tamara had stumbled outside and with leg injuries in the hospital, believing that her son had perished.
After her reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-disbanded News of the World newspaper) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it is getting paler in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shot scenes and that's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and who didn't make it outside.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could choose everything I wanted and the ride in a trolley open above.
But now he is afraid for place like Ukraine, where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the abominations," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could call and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
The people of London cried when I told our story.
I understood at the time how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the autumn of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting to her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir wanted to eat borshch and called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot at them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British so willingly shared our pain and supported us.
She said: "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now continuing, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
These are children like ours.
I think that for many, war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not overwhelmed by the past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends from the class and they occasionally go to the sports hall and light candles there.
When he was smaller, he suffered from it - I remember him sometimes lying on the sofa, facing the face away from us, for hours.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing away all his weapons and other military toys. Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for a few hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I recovered after the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with body parts lying around everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy in this hell could not possibly have survived.
"I remember shouting to him, "Damir, run, run away," but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And so life, unlike that of many others, goes on for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose horrific image became the symbol of the abominations of Beslan after the siege
Comfort: The Beslan survivor Georgi Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege in 2004, right a picture of Georgiy today
His blood-strewn face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a female doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before rushing off to take her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgiy managed to survive.
The closer this date gets, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is not a single day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it happened yesterday, some scenes from these days keep chasing me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Urgent: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgiy wanted to go to school that day so fondly. He said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the weeping Georgiy in San Marino.
Georgij does not like the picture, and it is hidden in our home on the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also mean that people around the world feel our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: "It's important that something like this can never happen again.
"I doubt that we will ever know the truth.
People study such tragedies again and again and never experience the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused him?
This world is becoming a terrible thing.
"I can't understand how that's possible, because when you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing at all with such pain.
It takes us dozens of years to forget it a little bit.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares because of the siege, but then things got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the sports hall when the 1. September is approaching.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical school in Vladikawkaz.
I'm gonna be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health didn't allow that.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won't happen.
Georgy Faniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Faniyev was trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the sports hall and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's really a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel it as if it would have been yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It's still with me, it's not something I've left behind.
I'm older now and people say that children can easily handle bad experiences - I have to say, that's not true.
"In 2006 I worked with psychologists and actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 - the year after that - was the first and only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Faniyev today, with a photo of himself in hospital after siege on laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me after school.
Physically, I'm fine.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I couldn't study at the FSB's intelligence academy in Saint Petersburg, as I wanted.
I have sent in my documents, including the medical ones, and they have replied that it is not possible.
My second passion was the animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've had two years there.
He learns to treat all animals "from cats to cows."
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know anything about this and of course they should not suffer it.
His mother Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse, when the anniversary is approaching.
I'm going to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know Georgy won't go.
It has to be much more violent for him because he was there and I didn't.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me. Here in Beslan, all of them are drawn.
It stays in us.
Georgy is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He has had multiple surgeries, he can walk but not play sports.
I would say that he has overcome the horror to 50%, but you can never completely overcome and forget that.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only intensifies my pain.
I have lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My Son is with me, and that is the greatest gift that God could give me, but my heart is crying for the killed.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped inside me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's going on in the world - wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I almost can't believe that.
We used to be a friendly country, how can it be that we are now fighting?
People and children suffer, I am sure that many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many more are being killed.
If only we could grab and throw out all these rebels - as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayeva, 10
The baby so poignantly carried to safety by a special operations squad
Rescued: Alyona Tskayeva is brought to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember the atrocities at all
The world held its breath in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried out of the siege of Beslan in the arms of a Russian policeman.
The terrorists let her go, but, in her cruelty, held back her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sports hall.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father, Ruslan, has since remarried and has a baby girl with his new wife, Svetlana, who he named Kristina after his lost daughter.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into a smart and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up with the 10th anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of running over girl at pedestrian crossing in Fife
A 78-year-old man is on trial for driving over a three-year-old girl on a pedestrian crossing in Fife.
Gordon Steward is accused of hitting a girl on the transition in Pittenween in East Neuk.
The indictment states that Mr Steward steered his Audi Q3 without the necessary care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart, 78, of Anstruther, denied the accusation in front of the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC suspended the proceedings for January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and videos
If you would like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available at a cost of under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to take.
Some cameras and camcorders feature scene and shooting modes that optimize exposure time for the dusky underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are only approved for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Search for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models in our shopping guide and the reviews.
Take multiple shots - because many won't work out.
Point-and-shoot cameras feature an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cams usually not.
Even if you have an LCD, it is difficult to look at this underwater, and the correct image setting is a matter of luck.
So make a lot of shots.
If your camera has a series mode that takes a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take shots in a pool, lake or sea.
This will also allow you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Go close to the objects.
This is also good advice on land, but it is all the more important underwater because of the low light conditions.
It’s especially important to work with an action cam: these devices often have a fixed wide-angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects when they’re supposed to fill out the entire picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changes things, even in such a gigantic organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesia physician, he dedicated his career to the task of saving the sick both the agony of the disease and the torment of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that the diagnoses and diseases are important to the doctors, while the patients are predominantly concerned with something completely different: pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I've had trouble picking myself up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he blamed his wife, Juliet, impatiently.
"I want everything immediately rather than later," he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt quite unusually and for no reason worried.
There was something in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray examination of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The result of the X-ray examination was available.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the pectoral fur, i.e. the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
While some smokers suffer from lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients used to be smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load - contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a "miracle substance" but has now been recognized as fatal.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can be ignored how easily.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the industry voluntarily committed to no longer using it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazardous substance from another time, it hardly seems to be worrying today.
But that complacency is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the culmination of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease than in road accidents.
Annual figures of mesotheliomate deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (1999, all types of asbestos have been banned) is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former workers of the construction industry.
Asbestos was, and is often still, present in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we learn and the shops where we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma knows no class barriers, financial limits, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant department stores in London to private schools, are not a shelter.
Parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are to be healthy, this fatal carcinogen has already been identified as the starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
It was indeed difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I did my training for six years," he wrote.
All - students, nurses, doctors and gategowners - use the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors who were trained at Guy's Hospital and who have contracted mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he was on the 17th. February of this year died, he was 55.
This was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesotheliomer patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends up deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still fall ill?"
The UK's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, assumes that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic is expected to come to a halt in the UK, a total of 90,000 will have fallen victim to the disease.
Most of them have no idea at the moment that they will die like this.

A quick look at the files of the courts, to which the parties concerned often turn for claims for damages, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma is already widespread.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently suspending asbestos to Janice Allen.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987 and was responsible for the clothing department in two locations - one of them the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
Now she has two children in her twenties.
"Before this thing," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought that would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestiform", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotil, also known as white asbestos, is today by far the most commonly found asbestos in buildings.
It was used for roof panels, floor slabs, pipe insulation, boiler insulation, even for brake pads in cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is nonetheless considered by the EU and WHO to be a "huge health risk" with a possible consequence of death.
However, the brown asbestos (amosite) and the blue asbestos (crocydolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there are clear but indirect indications that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates."
An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at the flagship store on Oxford Street, London, Alamy
Janice Allen may not have seen himself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Peto suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He has presented a study of those affected, which shows that "a substantial proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure was probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment."
According to him, much of these contacts are based on the "normal use and aging" of our buildings.
It looks like no one can assume to be safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which has examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, may have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the committee rooms of Parliament were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as they were "strong air movements."
Members of parliament are frequently accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite would be true.
While the Directorate of the Parliamentary Labour Service insisted that the Westminster Palace had received a "clean health certificate," it is now undisputed that 1 billion £ in work must be spent over several years to renovate Parliament, modernise the electrical installations and remove the asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, MPs will probably meet more in the nearby QE2 conference centre than on the green
The Goddard report also pointed out that "the presence of asbestos was not handled according to the respective provisions."
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
A person who could never accurately determine contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked in a hospital where asbestos lawsuits were decided positively," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places you've worked on, and the data.
What he still remembers is the day in early December 2009, when he got such a kind of fever.
He was 45, and performed an operation just late at night.
Suddenly I had chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I didn't think I'd make the trip home anymore.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was from the chest fur, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and put pleura cathether on to extract fluid from the lungs and test it in the laboratory.
His complaints, however, were without a diagnosis.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, the symptoms returned, often after exercise and severe breathing.
In 2011, a patient came to Abbott's with similar symptoms in his practice and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not associate this with his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again and his GP brought his CT scans and X-rays to a group of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a probe equipped with a camera was inserted into the cave between the rib and the chest fur.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going," he says.
Frankly, I hadn't worried that much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy was available in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of Mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom recommended he to take a lawyer.
Only now did he grasp the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos," he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now falling ill.
And so mesothelioma now hits younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous pipes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that over several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the attending physicians.
He is still being removed today.
Students put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
And it doesn't just affect hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-retardant properties.
Schools Too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
All over the country, in thousands of chemistry lessons, students have put their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
On websites, the topic of asbestos in schools is now frequently addressed.
And in the meantime, such innocent objects in our homes as such as floor slabs or shed roofs have contained asbestos by default.
"It's an industrial poison that's included in large parts of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial of Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to an affected woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So watch out for how you tear down your garden shed.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't focus on what I was doing.
I was in the practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty, the change of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient was.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to cope with.
"It was very hard to record all this," he says.
"I asked my doctor, "How much longer do I have?"
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to experience another Christmas.
That's it then.""
Mesothelioma is particularly insidious because it is our life support mechanism -- the breathing itself -- that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is stirred up and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pectoral fur, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest fur and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem arises with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers," according to Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
Exactly the hospital, which Andrew Lawson suspects has exposed him to asbestos, is now ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also believed to be exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed from the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
By nature, it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work so well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is highly controversial.
Some think she's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the chest fur," he says.
They can't get around it with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not respond very well to chemotherapy," which "shows effect," but does not heal.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors," Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live long, much longer than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting Mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counselling office for fellow sufferers four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center," he cheerfully introduced himself on calls.
"He was very positive," Abbott says.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six chemotherapy cycles that would last four months and his life would probably only extend by a month.
"I was desperate," he says.
I was going to give up.
However, Lawson managed to "let things appear in a slightly more positive light."
After consulting several doctors, Abbott, his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, heart thorax specialist to continue at Guy's.
"We had an advantage by not having to be re-expelled, I just called and got an appointment," Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma sufferers to be able to perceive the best therapies available.
But when these treatments inevitably fail, many sufferers stand by a different financial concern - about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It's been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health," Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that even a very low burden was a health risk.
And this is where the negligence of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually set up their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full-fledged compensation," since Lawson could not prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact at Guy's.
However, after investigating his death, a spokesman for the Guy's confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s."
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma sufferers who seek compensation, it is an enormous problem to assign the deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of her previous employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents may be lost.
And those who resist claims know that the time is for them, but most certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there have been significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for those affected by Mesothelioma to file for compensation, even if their former employers are no longer found.
The law has set up a £350 million fund funded by the insurance industry for anyone diagnosed after July 2012, can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In those cases, the plaintiffs will receive 80 per cent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages trial - about £120,000.
About 300 successful applications to the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal from insurers for insurers," he says, suggesting that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't gone over it and mesothelioma sufferers could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then employment and pensions minister, also admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, given seven fatalities, swift action was necessary daily.
"People are suffering so much and need help today," Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Act in December of last year.
At the time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Prof for 19 months. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After their initial deliberations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a survival rate over five years of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strengthened.
"That's with the most important thing, of course," Abbott says.
You can see that again and again in patients.
There's something that makes you move on.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of the six chemotherapy cycles behind him.
Aftercare scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
That's not life-threatening.
This is end of life.
Again, Abbott underwent six chemotherapy cycles.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and psychologically very exhausting.
You have to think about practical things - about the money when I'm no longer, for example, or to my wife, showing how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you will be negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that's not always easy.
"For parents, that's hard," he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls that I had a disease that I would not grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and impetuous.
She told her friends and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesotheliomer sufferers, such conversations are not permeated by hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end, as well as for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government election, protesters swear retribution
On Sunday, despite increased calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament decided against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This approach probably fuels the long-announced protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists initiated the planning and mobilization within a few hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress basically allows the communist leaders to reject all non-beijing candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry," said legal expert Emily Lau, leader of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing had promised.
They lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, vice-secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that admitting public nominations in the elections would be too "chaotic" for the Hong Kong government.
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to have residents elected the presidency from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because there is a direct right to vote for Hong Kong citizens, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in the hands of the course of a closely controlled nomination committee by a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" are to be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public protests in Hong Kong took place in several years.
Behind the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to seal off the financial district if Beijing does not allow a real universal right to vote.
By Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, organizers said their movement had reached a new stage of civil disobedience and they were planning waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online announcement, the organizers said that the movement "has only considered the occupation of the central district as a last resort, an action that is to take place only when all the chances of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are sorry to say that today all the chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and tightened security measures including police forces and barricades were needed outside the government building on Sunday.
The riots are compounded by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland is intensifying competition for products and services.
In addition, fears are growing that the values of Hong Kong such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under the growing pressure of Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central movement's demonstrations as it jeopardizes business operations - Hong Kong's lifeline.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved in it and how long they last," said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to stir up fears that Hong Kong is spiralling out of control.
This impression is bad for investment.
China's state-controlled media also recently reported on the democracy activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights attended by 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the U.S. will now be broadcast to universities, where freshmen appearances are offered by private plane.
We are excited to be able to respond to this demand and offer the UK's first luxury travel service to today's students.
In order to achieve a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also indicated that the service had a security division.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to coach their belongings through the country in a dangerously cluttered car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university with a minimum of effort and maximum luxury this year.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings yet, as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students would book the service in the next few weeks."
The company also said it was expecting a market for this offering despite the £9,000 tuition fees per year.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from the students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as withdrawn.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NUS for higher education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start studying this month face a crisis of living expenses, as the available grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest livelihoods before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminists criticize race issue and police behavior after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
Participants lifted their hands into the air, singing, "Hands up, not shooting," while waiting before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
According to her experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproduction law and income inequality.
However, while tensions in the Midwest increased and received attention across the country, Perez saw that white women's responses revolved around the breed 100%.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the shots of 9. August came the personal essays with titles like "Thoughts to Ferguson from a White Woman" and "Feminism isn't just about the oppression of women" relatively late.
But for Perez, that meant an important change.
"I don't think you find in feminism many people who are about the white and talk privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pressured to express something about the incidents.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnicized that they have to express that.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women are exposed to every day, but which are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural space.
"I can post something funny about Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk publicly about a relationship, but not about safety in public space?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between racial and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the themes; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says her predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the rationale was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came at the point where white female fighters for women's suffrage like Susan B. Anthony the country in the late years of the 19th Century analyzed and found that the fight for the right to vote could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to stand up for women's suffrage, and the right to vote for black people should come later," Hattery said.
When you remember things like this, you become aware with power why women of color do not trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it still took a decade for white women to organize themselves against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group emerged nearly 40 years after the original request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the tide of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists played "catch" with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to a child's education as seriously as they do with the right to conception control?" Mitchell asked.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the struggle for reproduction rights and access to contraceptive means are now trying to understand what that means.
Well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, columnist for the Guardian demanding more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a danger inherent in the body - and opinions on race that are significantly different in public polls - will cite the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a more intersectional feminism, in which racial and gender issues are addressed, some of her comments on the race topic in America are still stunned.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson are in contrast to her earlier criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship of the police to the black community is not the only problem that pushes itself to the foreground of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police picked up nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country's southwest border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that for a re-examination of the issue as an essential women's issue, she would only have to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of labor visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories find a reverberation in the women's organizations," she said.
"Pig House" in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig that had made itself comfortable in the living room.
The detached house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
Among the details was a picture of the house's living room - which included a pig that had bedded his head on a sofa.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was published erroneously and has since been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the House's exposé, Connells described the former assembly house as a "unique single-family house with a bedroom."
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on promotional material.
The house sale caused interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
The SW city of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month
The search for a new millionaire in the south-west of Perth continues, with a lucky winner getting nearly $1.1 million out of Saturday's lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey drew the jackpot in the draw of the first division for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
However, the lucky winner has yet to come forward.
Shopkeeper Steve Forward said the profit was causing talk in the small town in southwest Perth.
The city is not talking about anything else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could occur.
Eight WA winners have celebrated winnings in the first division last month, a due conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a Belmont couple made the mega profit of $7.5 million just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had played for twenty years and said the prize would allow them the possibility of a world trip and the purchase of a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th. Winners of the first division in the WA this year, with a total of almost $85 million.
Leonidas asked to the gladiator arena
Not only the gladiators stood ankle-deep in the mud at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the leisure park.
But the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract well over 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain showers and the autumnal cold and were completely inspired by the historic spectacle.
There was a colourful series of depictions, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their importance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial fighter force from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial art in the soft sand-groomed arena.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter and sent his men into the ring one after the other for the heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, it was the "provocators" with a rectangular shield and short sword as well as a leg splint on the left leg and arm rail on the right arm.
This was followed by the "Essedarii" with breastplate, short sword and throwing lance as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who competed against the "Secutor" with throwing net, trident and dagger and after a short fight pushed the boys to the ground.
Then the swords crashed metallically, the shields scrambled and the throwing flints flew through the arena whirring that one could become afraid and afraid for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, always had an attentive eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman period tangible," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer "Freundeskreis Römerkanal", the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the theme park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage stated in his greeting.
After all, the Romans have brought not only war and conquest in our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings that we still admire today.
Remains of this were also to be admired at the Roman Day, such as "Aqueduct Marble" from the eleven-meter-high and 1400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood at Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Society once and now compared the water and energy supply, and Managing Director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of that time today".
This is also confirmed by Ralph Heiligen from the "Engineer Team Two" from Rheinbach, who presented surveying instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original mortgage, the warm air heating that once warmed the Roman villa.
Impressive also the footprints left by Wolf and Fuchs two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Land Monument Care at the Rhineland State Association had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the North Business Park in Rheinbach.
Enveloping walls of a farm building with a darre for drying grain and malting were found.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, explained the archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser.
She presented a number of finds from these excavations in a glass display case, including a large plate, several fine glass jars and parts of a petite necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, to the incursion of the Germans in the then Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In addition, the children dealt with the Roman windmill game, similar to today's mill play, or they wrote their names with metal handles on wax tablets, like the Roman pupils once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, make glass mosaics at the stand of the Rheinbach Glasmuseum and operate a heavy stone wheat mill at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center to grind the flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the original Roman travel car pulled by two cold-blooded cars, the visitors drove through the amusement park and also passed by the impressive stand of the Municipal Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks" here.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21. September will also be brought into the Roman year 2014, which was declared throughout the Rhineland and recalling the death of Emperor Augustus 2000 years ago.
Together with the Heimat- und Geschichtevereinen as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic hikes, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes are offered and remind of the Roman past of Wachtberg.
For example, a Roman legionnaire is told about his work on the drafty Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman period and a funny lesson in international understanding between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and Romans who moved in.
The Adendorfer Elementary School is dedicated to the Roman theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible at first glance traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made experienceable again.
In the Wachtberg Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the find of the Berkum matron sanctuary in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic weighs on West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are going at a distance.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is dealing a serious blow to West Africa's economy.
The crop is rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has severely affected the region.
Some international companies are also already at a distance.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one," said Donald Kaberuka, the head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the hardest hit
"It's a total disaster, we lose a lot of money," says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second-largest market in Liberia's capital, Monrovia.
The only thing on the market is who wants to buy food or something for disinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is hardest hit by the virus, here alone more than 600 people fell victim to the fever.
Recently, health authorities declared the disease had penetrated into every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
In total, more than 1500 people have already died, with thousands more infected.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Companies everywhere in the resource-rich countries are suspending their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines no longer fly to the affected regions.
The local traders and farmers are also reacting: only a few merchants are still leaving their hometowns to get supplies.
In some areas in Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, among other things, the cocoa and coffee beans in the fields, which are important for export, are rotting.
The farmers do not dare to leave their home for the harvest.
Food is becoming scarce
"People are going to travel less and less," says Phillipe De Vreyer, Parisian expert on West Africa's economy.
The man, for example, who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables, prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
In the markets, the stock of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is at risk of damage to its image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The decisive factor is how far and how long the virus will spread.
“Investors may have the impression that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and thus also to invest,” warns Hugon.
The disease is also weighing on states' strained state budgets
The disease also burdens the already stressed state budgets of the affected states.
The rating agency Moody's fears that their budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the health system and additionally by the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank already promised to help out the health systems of the affected countries with 60 million dollars (45 million euros).
The effects are also noticeable in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
But elsewhere, many people are already staying at home for fear of contagion.
Reservations in hotels are also declining significantly.
Shooters celebrate her 50. Jubilee
The shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates from 12 to 14. September his 50th anniversary of its founding.
Preparations for the 50-year-old foundation festival from 12 to 14 will be in full swing at the Schützenverein Tannenwald. September.
It is scheduled for Friday, 12. September, a big entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker".
Saturday is the big firefighting at 6 p.m.
Afterwards, in the big marquee is the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Brass band provides the music
Highlights on Sunday are the festive service and 9.30 a.m. in the parish church and the big pageant at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon is also the price distribution of the federal and Gau shooting.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 ladies with their dirndls.
Festkapelle is the brass band Berngau.
Mayor Wolfgang Wild and State Secretary Albert Füracker have taken over the patronage.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates from 1907, when on the 21st. March the association for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room fitting and small caliber shooting" has been founded.
The Nazi regime had arranged for the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was not until 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on the 30th. April in the Gasthaus Lukas the "new" shooting club "Tannenwald" Berngau have been founded.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club as shooting champions through a difficult initial time, in which it was mainly about finding a club restaurant and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the Schützenverein started in the inn "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, who were now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1. Gauliga.
The club records tumbled every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was reached for the first time in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of the active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the club restaurant "Leininger" no longer met the requirements of a modern shooting club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn has decided to create a future domicile in the basement rooms of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After a workload of 2700 hours, on the 8th. May 1988 Pastor Strasser for the new shooting rooms the church blessing.
One of the great highlights in the club's history was certainly the 44. Gauschießen, combined with the solemn consecration of the new flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24. In April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995, a group of firecrackers was founded.
Josef Schmalzl became a firecracker.
A major challenge for the "Böllerer" and for the club as a whole was the orientation of the Bavarian Böllertreffen 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting range in the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought them up to date with the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round competitions
The sporting achievements of the shooting club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently participating in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, an air gun team, one sports gun KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1. Team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has moved up from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the round 2013/14.
The 2. Team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has ascended from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting sports, events such as buck stings, carnival and king ball, club outing and Christmas party have tradition.
The shooters are also present at the festivals in the parish and the parish.
Tony Stewart suffers accident on return to racetrack
Tony Stewart's return to the racetrack ended about halfway through his race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart raced against the wall for the second time after his right front tyre burst on lap 172 and finished his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without talking to journalists.
His team principal Chad Johnston said his 14-strong team was disappointed but was now focused on next weekend's race in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better effort and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart drove into a wall earlier at the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result," Johnston said, adding: "It just didn't work out."
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the tractor and the team had packed and was ready for departure.
Stewart dropped out of three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ash track race in northern New York state.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. is being investigated. This one had stepped on the road during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least another two weeks.
No decision has yet been made on whether Stewart will face an indictment.
The three-time champion was received with great acclaim when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12. Position, Stewart had already advanced to the first 10 shortly afterwards and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a restart in round 122, Buschs got into
Car with the No. 18 out of control after exit from turn 2 and collided with Stewart, with both carriages driving against the wall.
Stewart kept driving but dropped back to No. 21.
Dance-loving offspring wanted
Just try it out: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to fellow contestants.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn have to teach the full-day lessons at the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have severely decimated themselves.
Now more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, formerly a dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits," there are only nine children left.
"Three in the group of eight- to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve- to 15-year-olds," the 20-year-old recounts.
With more active people, the whole thing would be significantly more fun, "you could dance quite different choreographies," she says.
If you feel like dancing, you can sniff into the training session on Thursdays between 17 and 18 o'clock or on Fridays between 17 and 18.30 in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the trainer.
After that, different choreographies are practiced.
JazzDance has the feature that there is no set shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, the conviviality is not neglected either.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance films and we've already stayed in the dance room," reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
If jazz dance is not so, you can also get a taste of one of the other offers of the TV Jahn.
Children and adolescents can always sniff into the lessons on Wednesdays in the areas of children's dance/jazz dance, Bambini ballet, video clip dancing and hip-hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
If you fancy Discofox, Slow Waltz, Viennese Waltz, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango, you can stop by and participate.
Bulgarian prison supervisors protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison employees from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands for restoration of their old working conditions, which were recently changed.
Higher salaries are also on a demand list to be discussed with interim Justice Minister Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for a month, calling for a return to the earlier 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the prison staff and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the national Bulgarian ratio (BNR) reported.
Negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the implementation of punitive measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told the BNR.
The protest of the prison staff is expected to be supported by members of the union association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, the pro-Russian fighters are still on the rise.
After heavy battles, in which allegedly also Russian tank battalions were involved, the Ukrainian army has today, Monday, the airport of the rebel stronghold of Luhansk.
The army also said seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from his army's heavy defeats in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving details.
Pro-Russian separatists shot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have shot down a warplane and two military helicopters again.
Around 100 soldiers were also injured or killed in battles in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Coast Guard ships sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian Coast Guard boats for the first time in the Sea of Azov.
Ukraine's border guard confirmed that two of its ships had come under fire Sunday near the port city of Mariupol.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported bringing several towns in the Donetsk area under their control.
Diplomatic offensive in Minsk
In the Belarusian capital Minsk, the Ukraine Contact Group is meeting today.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also take part.
In advance, all actors used their performances to publicly announce their demand.
NATO won't break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia due to the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
Speaking in Brussels on Monday, NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO was sticking to the 1997 founding agreement of the NATO-Russia Council.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a stark breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner," Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that "they regard us as opponents".
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen has also announced that it intends to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A "readiness action plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as this is necessary," Rasmussen told reporters in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed on new talks to resolve their gas dispute, according to official figures.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
A European Union decision is still being awaited as to whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine hasn't been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
Most recently, EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger had mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned Russia could also disrupt gas supplies for Europe.
Europe sources about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power word: Toll will come 'very clear'
Now the Chancellor is clearly committed to this once again.
But it is not a free pass for all complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have increasingly scrubbed the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after ongoing opposition from her CDU.
"To be quite clear: she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU's top bodies in Berlin.
Merkel, however, did not commit to a detailed model for the time being.
In the black-red government program, "certain parameters" are mentioned.
Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has "made a proposal, and this is now being worked on further."
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no to a toll on all roads.
Merkel emphasized that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) is also constructively involved in the deliberations for a draft law.
In addition to the topic, he also talked to Dobrindt about further possibilities to activate more private capital for investment in infrastructure, for example in broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it." Schäuble had left a "mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house examining its own concept to pay for highway investors with toll revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU leader Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the lead minister in the cabinet.
CDU Federal Deputy Armin Laschet reaffirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never assumed to mow all county and federal roads," the North Rhine-Westphalian CDU state chairman said.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced to talk again about the topic.
Resistance to the plans also comes from the CDU state associations of Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate.
The background is fears that a toll will affect the small border traffic to neighboring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the toll criticism from ranks of the CDU.
The left sees the plans as a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks toll is dead," party leader Bernd Riexinger told the Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung (Monday).
"With the toll, the minister fails." Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette requirement on all German roads, which is scheduled to start in 2016.
However, domestic car owners may not be charged additionally according to the coalition agreement.
Therefore, they should receive a full compensation for the toll via the motor vehicle tax.
However, the model must not disadvantage foreign drivers in accordance with EU law because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
One Brit says she thought, as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years, that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK shared that misdiagnoses are a common problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, an unsafe gait and curved toes.
Patients also suffer from numbness or pain. The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich-Ataxie (FA) - a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would be in a wheelchair before she would get 18, and before her 30. Birthday dying.
The mother of two, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same thing as the others.
I fell constantly and everything lasted longer with me.
I could never ride the other kids roller skate or skateboard and was often teased at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, she saw her medical record after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles tendons and stretching her feet when her doctor had left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I had been curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, searched for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society," she said.
When I received an answer, I was shocked and scared.
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in between I would slowly lose all my skills.
I made all this out with myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she turned 17, she realized that her skills hadn't lost weight as much as she had imagined and questioned her doctor.
He just got up, and hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have that, otherwise you'd be in a wheelchair already."
I think you have a little less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was detected in her.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to draw attention to this disease.
Staff Sergeant a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a fireworks display since the closure of the former military training ground
For almost ten years, there has been no more shooting on the former military training ground in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere area.
The grenades are sometimes still so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
A deafening bang echoes over the heart of the biosphere area during the blasts.
In December 2004, the last sharp shot fell at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since that time, the 6500-hectare area has been the centerpiece of the Swabian Alb biosphere reserve, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden of businessmen in the Washington area rises with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to government and local agencies in the financial year 2013, a 3.8 percent increase over 2012 revenues of $26.6 billion.
The state and local tax burden on companies increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, compared to 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the several years of falling 2009 and 2010 notices.
State taxes rose more sharply than local levies, up 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by the Ernst & Young service agency with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from companies.
Virginia generates the lowest tax revenue from companies at 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenues is due to a recovery in companies' property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after the three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of that gain came from major states like California, New York and Texas, the process also seems to apply to the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in government and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012 - a 4.2 percent increase over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not so effective in increasing state and local tax revenues in Maryland, as here property taxes amount to just over a fifth of companies' tax rulings.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay nearly half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"In Maryland, the following happens: a large portion of the properties, particularly in the tax area around D.C., is owned either by the government or by non-profit organizations that do not pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, managing director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced, for example, to rely much more on income taxes in order to be able to provide the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed solely to the recovery of the real estate market
Corporate revenues also appear to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes at state organizations of $2.3 billion compared to 2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the region's highest amount.
While the trend is heading in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses is not rising evenly in all three places.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent to the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia reported a below-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income taxes with 6 percent in all three areas of office (in all three there are fixed corporate tax rates).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the district relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower government and local corporate taxes are required in Virginia and there is a better tax climate overall than in Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina has passed legislation to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the coming year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are therefore paying more government and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people - a transitional structure by which most small businesses are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with an increase in general multi-air tax revenues for the state and local governments by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Still, the Washington area could lag behind if the federal government's spending cut impacts the labor market in the region.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt's twin city Guangzhou - this is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery would settle in our city," the South China metropolis's deputy party secretary, Li Yiwei, said this week during a visit to an SPD delegation in his city.
Again and again, the official of the ruling Chinese Communist Party came back to this concern of the twelve million metropolis in the course of the conversation.
Guangzhou, which in Germany is also called the canton, is one of the richest cities in China, Li advertised.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host he would be looking for a possible partner for the project in Germany.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joie de vivre," he added at the lunchtime with the party superior in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiates Mr. Li, he flattered the host.
As a result, the official from Guangzhou toasted with shepherd-Gümbel - but with red wine, which was served with the food.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, Deputy Party leader Li said.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again," the local politician was convinced.
"Business transactions between our two cities continue to increase."
Currently, travelers would have to take the detour via Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also hoping for the flight connection.
The vice-governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish in the foreground during his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," replied Schäfer-Gümbel - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate connoisseur of Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-groomed partnership
Guangzhou's ambiguous deputy party leader hopes he can visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He only came to office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The crackdown on Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being enforced with hardship by head of state Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Prior to taking office in Guangzhou, he served as a top official in Fujian, where carmaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong as the whole of Hesse with its economic power.
Next year, it wants to achieve a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
Joan Rivers family 'crosses fingers'
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she was admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago; however, her daughter today expressed hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all keeping our fingers crossed.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
The doctors keep her intentionally sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with her condition, which continues to be described as "serious."
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Eco-friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
For cars and vacuum cleaners that will be on the market from today, stricter environmental standards will apply in the future.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive from 1. September to a label on which the buyer can recognize central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, sharper nitrogen oxide values apply in the pollutant class "Euro 6".
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding builders: They receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what information had reported on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a variety of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (970 million US dollars).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like selling Twitch to Google's video service was for a cool billion settled cause, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, had launched as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to release their bravura pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games," according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which know-it-alls give the (mostly older) games a coat of secret science theater, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often called when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was recorded a bit bored, a textbook example of an established technology company that buys up a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't materialize, as the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about it at the moment is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us get there faster."
Another secret, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.
For snobs like me, who explain that they would rather play sports than watch, it is difficult to grasp the attraction that assumes to watch others play instead of taking the control console in their own hands.
It's one thing to look over a friend's shoulder at 3 a.m. as she sneaks through Resident Evil, and something very different, watching a weirdo watch him get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are first-person games, so watching without your own control over the view perspective can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the quick runs, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age complete games in record time, are entertaining.
But as long as there is not a game or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
But what do skeptics like me already know about it?
Twitch is viewed by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of internet traffic peaks.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch will be integrated as elegantly into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube Twitch could have just swallowed.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men being courted as advertisers.
As Twitch's chairman, Shear, said Amazon and Twitch "believe both of them about the future of gaming," and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest on Saturday.
The concept of the organizers was right.
Despite the heavy downpour on Saturday evening, an estimated 1200 music fans came to the open-air festival in the castle garden.
At times, the entrance had to be stopped.
"That was annoying," said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salzwedel l Light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the Salzwedel Castle Garden should radiate brightness during the day and in the evening through various shows.
Well, and the fun comes by itself anyway.
This was already evident early on Saturday, when the first visitors set off for the open air.
The organizers had promised a celebration for all generations.
And they succeeded in that.
Around the supply stalls on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, but also guests from the surrounding area had made themselves comfortable.
They watched the first live performances, rocked their feet to the beat, enjoyed cool drinks - in short: pure relaxation and enjoyment were the order of the day.
And that across the generations.
While some were snooping on blankets on the extra carted white sand at the beach bar, others feasted on a neighborhood of wine in the wine shop, the offspring raged on the bouncy castle, which was a big attraction for the smaller guests.
But also in children's make-up, the volunteers literally had their hands full to master the crowd and conjure imaginative creations into the small faces.
The bigger ones used the kicker tables or participated in a skateboarding workshop, which the Goodfoot crew hosted from Salzwedel.
Until the big rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m. he slammed down on the visitors, especially families looking for the vastness and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not stop there.
"There were more people than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success across the board."
Therefore, there is nothing to oppose a repeat of the big party in the coming year.
Although work has yet to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear to the popular voice in a first assessment on Sunday.
He described as annoying that in the meantime the admission had to be stopped.
Clearly, the security company had been booked with too few forces.
The result: Some who had already paid no longer came to the premises.
The response was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedel co-organizer spoke of about 1200 visitors frolicking in the castle garden.
There were problems with sound technology.
The Salzwedel hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox therefore broke off their performance unnerved.
The technicians were unable to create a reasonably reasonable sound.
The planned hookah lounges could not be set up because the tents could not be brought to Salzwedel because of a puncture.
"But next year they will be there," the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula open-air was more than successful from the number of visitors.
And in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes, which will be forgiven the first time, but must be eliminated in the second edition.
The organizers also have to take criticism on the social network Facebook.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you just expected more," Melanie Meier comments on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you took over a little bit," says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others don't see the initial problems quite so closely.
I think it's very good that some not only talk stupidly, but also really try to put something on their feet.
Hats off!" Stephanie Jenß writes to the Amula.
Now the organizers have one year to put aside these criticisms.
New radome in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not the case.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be inserted into the striking structure.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Almost 50 years after the construction of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, the so-called radome, is completely renewed.
The new radome, with a diameter of 47.5 meters, will be slightly smaller than the old one.
The size still remains a world record.
The last step to complete the new case is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old shell is separated and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new case will be put on.
If the weather plays along, the action should take place at the beginning of this week.
Participants in the Ice-Bucket-Challenge dislocates Kiefer
Isabelle Roberts of Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she violated the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully wrong.
A woman was hospitalized after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket challenge that she dislocated her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from Britain screamed so much when her ice-cold water was poured over her head that she was hurting her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I screamed, and while I did the act, my jaw just stopped," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn't work, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too and almost put themselves in the pants with laughter, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was hospitalized to get her jaw back in after taking part in Tuesday's viral trend.
The clip was linked to an internet sensation and a thousand times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castle clubs soon pull together again?
Recently, there was always dispute between the two Wolfratshauser castle clubs.
Now the boards are thinking about possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde, led the project in Guédelon, France.
Just a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunde Wolfratshausen.
The points of view of how the history of the Wolfratshauser Burg and a possible reconstruction are to be dealt with have been dealt with have differently so far.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: Talks on a joint approach are to be held soon.
This is confirmed by the club board members Torsten Sjöberg (castle club) and Herbert Piffl (castle friends) at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit down once," reports Sjöberg.
In his view, all members of both clubs could pull together again in the future.
This means that visible successes are more quickly achieved.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until last a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest in mind, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and experience" of the site is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he has been presided over the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found in a general meeting in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we initially let the club activities rest out of respect." This “thinking phase” was necessary to “consider how it could go on.”
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the Burgfreunde could also make a current mood within their grouping.
There is currently no candidate for the presidency, says Piffl.
“But I’m confident someone will find each other.” He himself does not want to run for office because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a Wolfratshauser.
The Tölzer wanted to "but very much like to continue working on" the project.
The different viewpoints in terms of reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffl in the near future.
He pays tribute to Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air castle.
Through a high participation of the population as well as by volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I too was skeptical at the beginning.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward.” A "unique selling point" for the rafting town could be created.
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project would be financeable through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." He hopes that the castle club may move a bit on this point.
Their goal of first documenting the story "is important and good."
After that, you could see further.
Clever ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, the near-second-semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan scheme for books from higher-semester students and offered nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie," said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430, he said.
He spent $120.
The college management said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 annually on textbooks and study material, but that there were various cost-attenuation options for the students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a significantly cheaper price than when buying.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 university book stores, said renting textbooks had doubled since 2011.
Surveys in the industry show that about a quarter of the books in the college bookstores were rented last spring semester, Neebo's vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here's the one-off for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books cost only a third of the price online for which they are available in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs nearly $290, but can be obtained from the specialist textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying used
If you don’t mind the notes of other or normal signs of use, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business."
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended students ask their professors if previous expenses were allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant for the seminar papers.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc's Half.com is also a popular alternative for used books.
Rent
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them reasonably well, remember to return them and you don't want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80 percent of the cost of a newly purchased book.
A student, for example, could rent "Calculus" for the duration of a semester for about $20.
Find out about the terms of the store where you rent, including the penalty fees that may apply to the writing of notes, underlinings or signs of use.
Tenants pay attention: If you don't return the book, the penalty fees can even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are de facto rented by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while scientific and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for price determination in books, as you can be so sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online, you should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson the hard way.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" didn't become a box office hit
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone made less than 30 million dollars of its 90 million dollar budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" pocketed just 12 million dollars of its budget of 70 million dollars.
The film "Sex Tape", tailored to Cameron Diaz, only made 14.6 million dollars on the opening weekend, while children's films such as "Dragon Taming Made Easy 2" also disappoint in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films itself could be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as "the worst year" so far for children's films, describing "dragon taming made easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, with films for a slightly older audience, it seems as if the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for every summer movie launch, the one between American Memorial Day and the 20. July 2013 and in the current year on at least 2000 canvases were shown.
The results are based on the opinion of cinemagoers and film critics, suggesting that this year's film hits are equivalent to those of the past year.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services such as Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's soon-to-be-released jungle book film, told Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We have to accept that and not try to follow the past.
In contrast to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently generated revenues with the streaming content in the amount of 1.2 billion dollars, almost twice as much as last year, in which sales amounted to 837 million dollars.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming of comics and predicting a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his bleak prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
The producer of X-Men, Simon Kinberg, described the decline in cash results recently as simply "cyclical" and told Hollywood Reporter: "Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about business anymore."
When a few years ago the 2. Table tennis district class for the purpose of tightening the league division has been cancelled, this has been a step in the right direction.
Now the German Table Tennis Federation has an additional 3. Bundesliga included in the program.
The result: Those who did not ascend have descended.
Göttingen's highest-ranked team Torpedo has avoided relegation in the upper league relegation, but will only play fifth-class in the coming season.
Torpedo's ladies remain fourth-class, despite their grandiose march into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys of the SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve compete in the new association league, in the Landesliga no more Göttingen clubs are represented.
For the ladies, the TTV Geismar plays in the Verbandsliga, the torpedo runner-up in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new District Upper League South.
This is where TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC compete.
In the District League, regional representatives Dransfeld and SC Weende play, in the district class of the TTC II, red-and-white, the Bovender SV II and the teams of the TTV Geismar II and III. The district upper league of the ladies begins at least in target strength.
Güntersen, the TTC and the TTV Geismar II are here.
Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen start in the District League.
With nine teams each
The SC Weende sends his girls to the small district league.
Also, the district league season of the SCW boys - there still starts Torpedo II - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly founded regional association, the two Göttingen district leagues start with nine teams each.
In the West Squadron are the Rot-Weiß II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East Squadron, among others, Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen play.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the district of Osterode, where there are no more women's teams at the county level.
It is striking that none of the six 2nd circle classes reaches target strength, here the innovative and busy county board will have to think about it before.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Over the weekend, there were protests from opponents of the Nato summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in central Newport for an anti-Nato march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff outside the local town hall to hold a so-called counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments for us over the weekend and talking to protesters who have travelled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers flown out of the Blue Mountains
TWO teenage bush hikers were brought to safety with the winch after being trapped in the Blue Mountains in NSW throughout the night.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour in Govett's Leap in Blackheath shortly after Sunday noon.
Worried relatives called police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search party from local police and emergency services broke open and the couple were found near the Bridal Veil waterfalls at about 23 o'clock.
The girl had injured his knee and the man had fallen and had his head opened.
Rescue workers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were admitted to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition by ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalate
The roughly 1000 protesters had been forced out of the PTV building by soldiers, Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station resumed the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the protesters equipped with sticks had damaged equipment in the editorial board.
Dead or injured were not reported.
Protesters are calling for the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of election fraud.
Police said around a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, around 3000 protesters with security forces were again clashed on Monday.
According to hospital information, a police officer was injured.
Over the weekend, at least three people had been killed and more than 500 injured as protesters tried to advance to Sharif's residence.
They are calling for the resignation of the prime minister.
The powerful military had called on Sunday evening, after a meeting at the army headquarters, to a political solution to the conflict, "to waste without time and to use without force."
The statement said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The escalating violence has fueled concern about a military intervention that has already covered more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on 14. August on.
Sharif opposes a resignation.
Khan and Qadri had called on their supporters on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri expressed similar sentiments.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the May parliamentary election in May last year through fraud.
Qadri is calling for the resignation of central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government is supposed to reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40 000 security personnel are deployed to protect the government district.
The protesters had initially peacefully persevered outside parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them over the weekend to advance to Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after second win of the season in third place in the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday has come to a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The win is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the out in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The sense of achievement was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goal scorer Steffen Hofmann, who pushed forward to third place with green and white.
Schrammel dream goal brings Rapid on winning road Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second win of the season and goes into the international break with a sense of achievement.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction," said outside-back Thomas Schrammel, who with his glorious leadership volley from the sixteenth-round in the 14th Minute set the course for victory.
"I thought I'd punch all the frustration of Thursday and buckle him under the bar," the 26-year-old said with a smile.
As a scramble on the 13. Novmember 2010 had scored for the last time in a Bundesliga game, that was still for Ried.
The first championship goal in the Rapid dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I'm from the rapid offspring," Schrammel said.
Due to the short-term pelvic injury of Mario Pavelic, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and did his thing very well there as well.
He has enough experience that he can also exercise this position in a mirror-inverted manner.
He deserves the goal, he has already made some assists this year," Barisic praised.
Team show character Schrammel also delivered the flank to the 2:0 by Hofmann after a good hour, which finally brought the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we were a little lucky today," said Schrammel, who alluded to the gap between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results were not right, but the playful was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even felt that one had been "better in many games before than today" - against "the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season."
The first three-pointer since 26 July has therefore proven that the team structure is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
For him, no less pleasing: "That we finally played to zero again".
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have to complain about several failures, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger, made the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," warned Barisic, who lost players in the past three days with Behrendt and Pavelic, "who have been very stable lately."
The international break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and gain a bit in the physical area," explained Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks.
One who is probably particularly interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He tears himself apart for the squad, goes over pain over it.
Especially at this difficult stage, he has shown that he is a very important player for us," Barisic said.
Hofmann gave the game Rapids before his substitution in the 68. Minute not only the structure, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who is his 350. Bundesliga game completed, it was the first hit from the game since 2. November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "May not believe that everything is good now" "We have certainly been a bit lucky, but at some point the luck must also come back to us.
Now it was high time," Hofmann said.
He warned, of course, to continue working in a concentrated way: "You must not always see this in black and white.
We haven't played as badly as that has been portrayed in the last few weeks.
But we must not believe that everything is good now.
He could not dispute the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me at certain stages," Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame himself and his squad.
He regretted the quick counter-hit "from the Magic Gate category," as well as the regular goal by Nutz in the 40. Minute, which had been wrongly revoked by referee Kollegger.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal in some phases.
We have had too few degrees.
Centre-back Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found in and even scored a goal.
On the whole, there would have been more in it.
There is calm under this top
We showed a powerful tribe in our puzzle task of the summer series "My Piece of Rhöner Glück" last Friday.
Several of these tree giants still exist in the district, the specimen pictured is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A bumpy footpath leads up to the approximately 600-year-old oak tree.
It goes past paddocks, basalt stone heaps and basalt stone seas.
A little below the quarry of the Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there she stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it protrudes beyond the other trees of the environment and is reminiscent of an American sequoia with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree stump indicates that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intensive research, there was only evidence of the name origin.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has specially consulted the Bischofsheim archive and interviewed older people from Unterweißenbrunn to learn what kindness it has with the honey.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
According to this, until about 80 years ago, the goat herders are said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn onto the painstakingly cleared and stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the animal keepers exhausted from the ascent are said to have rested.
Meanwhile, the area has regained its importance, because on the meadows actually graze again goat herds.
The area has also been declared a core zone of the Biosphere Reserve, Schneider has further found out.
When entering the stone accumulations, however, one should exercise caution, because the basalt warmed up by the sun is also a popular place to stay for cross otters.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Other trails are signposted, climb up the direction of Hochrhön and invite you to an extended hike.
Where is the Wasserburg?
However, a water castle, which is sought at our next task, is rather rare in height.
The reflection in the moat already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historical buildings in the district, to which the building counterfeit could fit.
Where is our "piece of Rhöner Glück" located?

After weeks of tug-of-war, Italy's prime minister and acting EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, has pushed through the nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as head of EU foreign policy, against strong conservative opposition at the EU special summit last week, she will succeed Britain's Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as the pro-government daily La Repubblica reflects, considers the appointment of his Mogherini, who is also considered a favorite in the government team, as a strengthening of the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost from this for his "reform package" in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the left-wing party base, which repeatedly rises against him, because Mogherini is assigned to this - albeit rather in a moderate way.
According to the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and Poland Donald Tusk nominated as President of the Council, the prevailing opinion in Rome, will thus be established a political balance.
The EU’s chief diplomat will also become deputy to Commission President Juncker.
The outstanding approval of the EU Parliament is considered certain.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is spreading optimism that the Mogherini, who has been proven for almost two decades in leading party offices and known for her ambition, will face the "enormous challenges".
The native Roman woman is married and has two daughters.
The political scientist began her party career in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratic di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged in 2008 with the Catholic center party Margherita to the present-day Social Democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth (European Young Socialists) for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the party council of the Left Democrats, she entered the high party politics, worked in the foreign policy department, of which she soon became head.
She occupied traditional focal points of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on the NATO operation in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent, maintained contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the US.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies, in which she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he summoned Mogherini to his secretary of state.
If the PD today again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the over 40 percent votes of the party in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini, as is noted in PD circles, has a share in it.
The allegations in Brussels that the new EU foreign policy chief has too little diplomatic experience, so there is a lack of substance, is countered in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic members, suspiciously realistic accents of Mogherini on the crisis in Ukraine are pursued and defamed as a "Russia-friendly course."
It endorses the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas is to be transported directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves to secure Italy's energy.
After Renzi took office as EU chairman in July, Mogherini traveled to Moscow for her first state visit.
Photos they showed with Putin at the shake-hands were taken with outrage in Brussels, as well as that it invited the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit for October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an apprentice who has already completed a different training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will be working in four apprenticeships: electronics technicians (three trainees), mechatronics technicians (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All apprentices come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended secondary or secondary schools and secondary schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, the trainees of all vintages and the instructors drive to a team building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn are on the program.
The company has 435 employees throughout Germany and 950 people worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all vintages is 27.
The Socialists in France should "keep their mouths shut and put France in order," Francois Hollande's most important ally said.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet reshuffle has encountered disapproval among the vast majority of the French.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It's our duty to stay by his side," he said on great applause.
As an appeasing gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce calls for an easing of the settlement by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande had urged his fellow socialists to "unite" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, sprinkled sand into the gears where she appeared at a meeting of renegade socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "the faith in their future."
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant trench battles, saying she could not imagine the new Valls government would last for more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none either, they are forced to form a new government if the old one has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the autumn or winter," Miss Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party's call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident of emerging as the victor in early elections and was ready for government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead in the EU elections in May.
A poll in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people think the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking up in several rival factions before Hollande's 2017 term ends.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government did not achieve an improvement in the economy and record unemployment figures.
"There's a little window for possibilities, but public opinion has to quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could deteriorate further.
Norwegian Cruise close to a deal with Prestige Cruises of $3bn
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third-largest cruise operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to experts in the industry.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships, as well as its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced as early as this week, sources said Sunday, warning that the talks could also end inconclusively.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous because the negotiations were not public.
Representatives from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesperson for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America and the Caribbean.
His revenues stood at $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenues for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent year-on-year.
The cruise industry is at a total of about $29 billion and in the next few years it is expected to be in place due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice for these new customers at the cruise operators.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulators for the IPO in January 2014.
Apollo is the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 through a merger with a cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreational and casino mixed corporation under the control of Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares at the end of June, according to regulatory authorities, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and the private equity firm TPG Capital LP held an 8 percent stake in the company.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly have 82 percent of the passenger capacity on American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for Prestige Cruises' IPO.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A beijing-loyal group waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday passed a framework law allowing only two or three candidates for the leadership election in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first achieve the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be staffed with Beijing-loyal members.
By that decision, it becomes almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be admitted to the election, prompting pro-democracy activists to live up to their threat and paralyze Hong Kong's financial hub with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial issue in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
After the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China's dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the election process in the special administrative region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and organized a sit-in there.
Li's questioning is organized by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese liaison office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Commission of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Vice Director of the Hong Kong Office of Affairs and Macaus of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced they would gather outside the Hong Kong leadership office in the afternoon.
Britain did not provide for any democratic elements until the final stage of the 150-year colonial government in Hong Kong.
Putin is demanding Kiev's start of "statehood talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease the fighting against the separatists in the east of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the breakaway region.
His spokesman Dimitry Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the territory of eastern Ukraine, which is under the control of the separatists, would become a part of Russia, but that his status with Ukraine had to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents, however, fits with the strategy apparently pursued by him since the riots began five months ago: help for the separatists in taking territories and pressure on the Ukrainian government to enable the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region to have de facto independence for an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state-run Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture the separatist-held areas in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were taken in March and April after Moscow took the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on 18. March had annexed.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossiya" or "New Russia," a term reminiscent of the pre-revolutionary heyday of the Russian empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who, in the wake of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on 26, will be held. Oct. and while government groups are attacking civilian communities in the separatist-held areas hoping for soon-to-be peace talks are "captive in their illusions," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately start detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of the greater autonomy that has been debated for months by the Kiev leadership to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern territories, Peskov said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a matter of a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but about an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification to correct Putin's remarks' "misinterpretation" underscored Russia's leadership claim in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east in contrast to the direct annexation of Crimea, on which the majority of the 2 million residents are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulty annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russians and polls from the period before the conflict revealed a broad majority in favour of remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which was addressed by Russian diplomats on international forums, would give authority to regional governments in Ukraine to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, and thus de facto give the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is the home port for the majority of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region in Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko struck at his speech at the inauguration on 7. June before the fact that the Ukrainian legislation - after new elections - should consider additions to the constitution, which give the respective territories greater control over their finances and the status of the languages.
But his notion of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose armament and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on equal terms followed after another entrant by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine over the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novoazovsk in the coup, which is the first step of a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to Crimea, according to fears of Ukrainian security officials.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to fortify Mariupol, a 500,000-inhabitant steel industrial port located between Novoasovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of the EU leadership in Brussels on Saturday and urgently asked for action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are on the verge of a point where there is no turning back," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take concrete action, the leadership demanded the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which are to come into force in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukraine crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for Ukraine's National Security and Defense Council reports said Saturday in Kiev.
The first presumably 63 Ukrainian soldiers trapped by the Russian incursion in Ilovaysk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers who had been captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photo scandal surrounding Australian celebs and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten made no secret of his anger over hackers who presumably stole nude pictures of his fiancee Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of the A-celebs from Hollywood.
The film city is in excitement after a series of clear photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking scandal surrounding celebs has surfaced on the Internet.
The hacker in charge probably has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star from "the tributes of Panem" and superstars, including the models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, the singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle as well as the actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Melbourne-based Grecko also reportedly published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
The list includes 101 celebs.
Noblest, who had gotten engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: "It's disgusting."
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that those affected felt "hurt."
The hacker is believed to have 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots in which she is lying on top without in a pool.
Palmer's film works include "Love is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available yesterday for comments on the chopped pictures.
A representative Lawrence' told TMZ: "It's a heinous invasion of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing but the sale of Hehlerware."
From a purely legal point of view, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers were at 8. Cycling on the Großer Feldberg and have thus supported the association "Help for children with cancer".
The tour, which was an ordeal for some, represented an easy workout for the others.
In one, however, everyone agreed: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberursel brewery took a bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put away the small muscle soreness, especially since he participates in the 8. Cycling on the Großer Feldberg in favor of the association "Hilfe für Krebskranke Kinder" (Frankfurt) had also personally brought a valuable insight.
It's a great thing.
"I know now that I can do this - great!"
Little pause on the way in the applause curve?
No, once I stopped, it would have been over...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel city parliament, many of the 718 participants tormented themselves yesterday in the early dew on mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the eleven-kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The Green politician from the district council - red dress, red bike - made something on understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there is the destination!"), but then proved to be a half-professional on the mountain and went through the finish after 45 minutes without shortness of breath.
He also drove through the track in one go, as did Nina Kuhn, press officer of the city of Oberursel, who had set out together with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we like to be there - we would have made an exit today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down to Oberursel in the morning to trample back to the height immediately afterwards.
Frankfurt's Florian Zierz had swung himself into the saddle at 9 a.m. in the morning, "made" the Feldberg twice, then roll home with fun.
"Frying Toni" also had fun.
For the head of the Oberurseler Kultkiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg are simply part of it.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes with his 6.5-kilo racing bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose - I like to be there," said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an "ambitious road cyclist."
That must be him, because he was with the "Fixie-Rad" on the road, these are also racing bikes, but without gear...
The fact that it went up easily even without a bike was demonstrated not only by the 20 hikers who climbed up the White Wall and the Fuchstanz to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights behind him on a cord.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with four-wheel-drive bully and quad, provided security, said: "I know him" from Frankfurt, who trains for a special sleigh trail, only that he pulls the sled himself". So the man is, in a way, his own sled dog.
The 718 participants - and thus more than ever before - had been sent to the track in groups in the morning.
The hikers first at 9.30pm.
This was followed by the first cyclists and runners at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Radeln auf den Großer Feldberg", gave the starting commands and wished the participants a nice outing.
For next year, he hopes that it will be possible to close the route to the Feldberg up to the safety of the participants.
