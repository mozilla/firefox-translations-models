28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping centre.
The victim's brother testified that he can't imagine anyone who would want to harm him, "Finally it went uphill with him again."
The body found Wednesday morning at the Westfield Mall was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the forensic medical department in San Francisco said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS broadcaster KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" over his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will sorely miss him," the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Louis Galicia indicated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that "things finally went uphill for him."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he could not imagine anyone who would want to harm his younger brother.
He was a friendly person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook us something, to prepare us dinner," said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to participate in any kind of altercation.
He was the brother who swam with the stream.
"With everything going wrong in the world, he was this uncut diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone who has information on the case is asked to call the SFPD's tip-off phone at number 415-575-4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn't always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood star has now made this unequivocally clear in an interview.
"I'm always put in drawers or get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
“I myself don’t want to be perfect and successful.”
"Honestly, these things are more like a sniff."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh about her being considered a "Miss Perfect," as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan."
The actress prefers to spend her time at home, in front of the TV with a loose bun and Mexican food, according to the magazine.
To the white glow, she brings the question of the desire to have children: "We women do not have to be married or have children to be perfect," according to the Hollywood star.
In her new film, "Mother's Day - Love is not a children's game," Aniston is seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be with us from 25. August.
Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid
His experience on horseback is manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer sought a bit of variety with some colleagues with a ride on the beach.
For the 58-year-old, it was a first.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes, the horses remembered their end of work, they chased home to the food troughs in a quick gallop.
One kilometer at that pace, I was scared.
"It wasn't a good experience," Langer says.
And that’s when the riding career ended again.
On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament wins - was back close to horses.
He was guided with his family over the facility of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swing himself for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and with it at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German sports aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Goldene Sport Pyramid as part of a small gala.
The sympathetic athlete is not lacking in awards.
Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions Tour Player of the year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Longer is the 18th Award winner of the sports pyramid.
In Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler.
"This award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is awarded not only for sporting success, but also for social commitment."
Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.
And so he also passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time U.S. Masters winner was inducted into the "Hall of Fame of German Sport" on Saturday.
Among the winners are the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter-Michael Kolbe, bobsled driver Meinhard Nehmer, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends had come to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company migrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the large animals.
Clintons and Trump's economic policy by comparison: It's all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the trade deal TTP - that's what both Clinton and Trump want.
However, the two US presidential candidates disagree on tax and energy policy as well as on a fundamental issue.
The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical difference.
The one about the role of the state.
Trump, if in doubt, wants to keep those rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, on the other hand, would be very different, Trump claims.
He will massively scale back regulations, and he is campaigning for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for businesses.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: The state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up opportunities and needs money for it.
That's why taxes for the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure.
In which must be invested, Trump and Clinton say almost identically.
The Democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
State investment programs in infrastructure are classic Democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical teaparty wing of the Republicans.
So Trump could still face internal party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal extraction in the U.S.
Oil production should also be possible in previously protected areas, he wants to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand renewable energy with its investment program, demanding: "A country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only with the infrastructure - even with international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart.
TPP, the trans-Pacific trade deal, both do not want to sign.
At the same time, however, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade - but simply better protect American jobs.
They should be paid better, Clinton said.
The current minimum wage of US$7.25 is a hunger wage.
She wants to raise him to 15 dollars an hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to go up, then he says he should not be changed.
But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to develop more around the tax policy of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics tell him that the budget deficit would only be even greater.
On the other hand, Clinton, who at least wants to demand from the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: More taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: 'Every refugee woman has experience with sexual violence'
Sexual violence is almost part of everyday life for women who flee alone.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
There are four women in a large kitchen.
Everyone has a baby who is at most one year old.
One put her little son in his arm.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother is staring at the table top.
Until she realizes she's being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a sponsor of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run, among other things.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralized shelters for women who have fled alone and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - even as visitors.
The exception is a security guard at the door.
"It's not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her escape," Bahr says.
"Men are fleeing because of wars because they are being prosecuted politically because they face torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as hopefuls," she says.
In women, other reasons for the escape prevail: "Many steal secretly from it, because they see no other way out".
In their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That's what drives them away.
On the run, that goes on.
"That tugs, for example, are calling for a sexual act for a bottle of water is not uncommon," Bahr says.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Who thinks that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, is crazy, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and, in the worst case, abused.
As a result, about 90 percent of women who live in the shelter in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
“Some of the children certainly did not come into being voluntarily.”
Many women are so used to saying nothing.
“Or they don’t dare to speak openly about what they have experienced, because the shame is too great.”
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, it needs more accommodation just for them, Bahr demands.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.
When asked if they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answer no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in shelters of the governments.
Even in Swabia, women who have fled alone are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press officer for the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower and Middle Franconia there are in some communal accommodation floors or own houses only for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.
In a study published for the committee, it says: "It is very important that men and women are accommodated separately."
"If privacy is lacking or if men and women are accommodated together, it can come to - more continuous - violence against women."
The washrooms in particular should be separate and easily accessible for women, the study says.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowds that exist on the house in Munich.
"Since it has been around that it exists, we have a long waiting list," Bahr says.
You could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors strike: Demands for new industrial action measures
Representatives of the resident doctors have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes regarding a new contract.
The British Medical Association's Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) has called on its entire council to approve more industrial action from early September.
The JDC testified that ministers had failed to address the concerns about the treaty.
Assistant physicians and medical students voted in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA.
He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC chairwoman Ellen McCourt said the government would have remained "persistently calm" to issues, causing the treaty to be rejected.
She said: "In light of this, the JDC Board has voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and requested official renegotiations on all your concerns."
In response to the government's silence, the JDC Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing programme of escalating industrial action, beginning in early September.
The disputes caused resident doctors to strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS.
The Head of BMA Assistant Physicians Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions of the contract, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He informed BMA members during the meetings, which took place even before the vote by 54,000 assistant physicians and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the contract for doctors in England would be forcibly introduced.
Russia and Turkey: An "alliance of outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves their hands and announce an official end to the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Received by the Petersburg Palace, I cannot resist the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin's smile seemed narrow-lipped and he barely radiated warmth, even for his reserved conditions.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report, a whole five times.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old levels before the crisis, but will even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiating by Putin showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the downing of a Russian warplane on the Syrian border by Turkey.
Moscow's response at the time was furious.
Putin split out, accusing Ankara of falling in Russia's back.
The offence was even greater, as it was committed by a supposed friend.
Rebuilding the trust will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed like the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most seriously, the accusations were by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from the illegal oil trade in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He has vehemently denied this.
But in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia was able to record some kind of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after he was almost stripped of office in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - particularly the ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.
The number has declined by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights resume.
They count on a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television predicted cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it this way: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, as it regards its response to the attempted seizure of power as a weak response.
In addition, there is the continuing resentment over the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected state bodies after the attempted coup.
This is, mind you, a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this glamorous palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey, a, as an analyst once described to me, to represent "the alliance of outsiders": two countries that feel out of the West and feel badly treated and now ally.
Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial talks, both presidents testified at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the issue.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found on Syria.
But after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand is to be reduced to a back-office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has since distanced itself when it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other end-user financial brands.
She supported the international sport with millions of pounds in sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now she has decided to focus on more national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initialised.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, decentralised headquarters and stock market listing will move to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for retail banking that will get more meaning - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RSB brand will become our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I say now that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already testified that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the perceptibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to develop into the brand's bank, because how do we focus inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" the chief executive said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would have been a great bank for our customers and launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think you will see a lot of changes.
We can launch these brands again, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves his 3,000th profit at Newmarket on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket that brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th UK profit at Newmarket on Friday.
He relied on predilection, which is coached by John Gosden, on his local racetrack with his second win of the night a milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in the flat race.
He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
Three-time winner Dettori, who won on Ghayyar before that, said: "It's special."
I'm very emotional because my family is here too
I'm very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humble.
Dettori picks up the cheers as he takes the win on predilection
Two jockeys have reached the milestone in the obstacle race - jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockey of modernity and it's no surprise that he has reached this milestone that few before him have reached.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for races, his enthusiasm and charisma has been inspiring fans for this sport for years.
I told Frankie at Epsom a few weeks ago that he would have already picked up 6,000 wins if he wasn't just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has already ridden nearly 30 years of winners in GB, which is great.
He has a vibrant personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of the British flat race for two decades.
It was nerve-racking.
A whole series of major tournament wins, including his famous 1996 "Glorious Seven" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was given a drug ban.
Three years ago, he initially struggled when he returned from his six-month suspension, but he showed impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And he's far from over - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until the age of at least 50.
Russia's Putin fires chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's closest circle of trust for many years.
The 63-year-old was appointed special representative for environmental and transport matters.
In a statement issued by the Kremlin, Putin "ordered Ivanov's dismissal of his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons."
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov's deputy since 2012, has been appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the Kremlin's website, it says (in Russian) that he was later protocol chief and chief of staff of government personnel.
Speaking about his appointment to Putin, he said, "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your work as head of state regarding draft laws and checks to implement your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.
Do the smiling faces convince?
This move has made Moscow mystery.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest confidants and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As chief of staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which aired on television, both men claimed that the chief of staff was stepping down at his own request.
But despite the smile for the cameras, few are convinced of it here - especially now, just before the general election.
So is there a consequence of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim - that a man who was once touted as potential president would suddenly want to lead Russian environmental policy - encountered great skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said "it is true that in early 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated post - one could almost say - arduous posts for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most.
It was once assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution.
But this post was taken by another, close-knit ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president again three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which are producing the series, announced its termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized Thursday before the announcement of his termination.
On the set there were artistic differences and a disagreement.
I regret the incident," he said in a statement.
Details of how the character Gibsons from the series, who follows a team of FBI agents, will be written out, is expected to be released at a later date, according to the statement from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been there since the first season of the series in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there until the end, but that won't be possible anymore.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series.
The planned broadcast of the 12th season is on the 28th. September scheduled.
Mystery of fish that landed in garden in Banff
A resident of Banff requested help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks the 75 fish could be sand eels spewed out by a fountain.

Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "deck blower" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete, as well as 46 cable-stayed ropes.
The £1.35 billion project is due to be completed by May 2017.
Business Secretary Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with over 30,000 tonnes of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that requires extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
Overall, nearly 79% of the total bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck is getting a concrete casting for the deck in Rosyth today, meaning the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering building and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last section of the road deck and its connection to the northern tower deck under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, since the viaduct is 222 meters long, approx. 6,000 tons weighs and with a slope of approx. 3% had to be pulled up.
Sensitive, since the tolerances the team is working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men have 'luck still alive'
Three men have "lucky yet to be alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded the alarm at 13:20 BST on Friday after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had trouble swimming to safety while their boat moved on on their own.
"We saw the boat spinning around her near and envisioning the worst," the head of Moelfre's rescue station Vince Jones said.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach until we let to water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was found exhausted and hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop line, but it detached from the person who was steering the boat when the boat was capsized.
Someone watched over these men today.
Seriously injured - man stabs his ex-girlfriend
A man has attacked his ex-girlfriend in Hamburg-Harburg with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholic perpetrator cut up his ex-girlfriend's clothes.
When she came to the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in the hand and body.
Police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old destroyed his ex-girlfriend's clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother down.
She could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
That's why she walked out of the house with her significant other.
On the street, they met the man's ex-partner.
When the two women entered the apartment again, the 50-year-old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?
The SPD and Greens think that investors should be made much more accountable in the future.
How does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?
The SPD proposes a "concept of action housing" at the next council meeting.
But dispute is programmed.
First and foremost, the question is: Who should actually build the cheap apartments?
A regulation is missing so far.
Christoph Bratmann, chairman of the SPD parliamentary group, said: "We agree with the Greens that if you want to build on urban land, you will have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
However, the cheap apartments can also be built in the existing.
However, the big point of contention in the town hall is, according to Bratmann: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent on such land, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."
A new urban housing subsidy program, which will cost millions and still needs to be funded, is intended to provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
Regardless, according to Bratmann, a worsening of the situation in the housing market is approaching.
If the concept of action is implemented, this will provide additional tasks in the construction administration.
More staff are needed.
It's unclear whether we're going to get the professionals.
But the program is not yet completely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1300 cheap apartments, the promotion of which will expire in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.
To prevent that, according to planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be bought from the city.
In addition, it would have to be considered to bring apartments back into the price commitment.
This is possible in the western city.
In one fell swoop, the problem could be solved.
Because in the western city, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Around 1800 apartments could be brought back there in the price commitment for cheap apartments.
Only: The owners, the housing associations do not want that.
Because if the number of social housing in the western city is again drastically increased, one distances oneself from the goal of the so-called mixing.
There should be no more concentration of socially weak people in only a few districts.
The Greens expect there will still be movement in the discussion.
Holger Herlitschke, chairman of the parliamentary group, said: "For a broad majority, the CDU must join in the boat."
It has focused on more construction sites for single-family homes.
But this does not mean that a compromise cannot be found.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that is worth it
It is fascinating to watch the world change.
That teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their free time staring at screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is all about getting people off the sofa and making them more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and, most recently, to smartphones.
Therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I am of course referring to the Pokémon Go craze, an app that is based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs emerged from this).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest dropped somewhat before the release of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries has been shifted by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found, can be "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured."
A generation that played the game when it was even younger joined the delusion and jumped for the search from the sofa.
In the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person travels every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told The Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people tracked out every day spent 30 minutes jumping from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance.
Many public education campaigns on health that people want to get to "take 30 minutes to get off the sofa" and "be active every day" fell on deaf ears because many public messages on health are boring and come from people who look miserable.
Still, the importance of sport cannot be overrated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that is too long to cite here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus, three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.
As always, there are also grumpy game spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could walk against a door.
What's up? What?
A breakthrough has occurred.
Even though smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise, as this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will subside over time.
However, because of Pokemon's success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with becoming active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jump horse.
Effortless on the beam.
Breathtaking on the floor.
All along the line brilliant.
And now finally Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast climbed to the multi-fight title on Thursday, widening the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympics.
Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of silver medalist and "Final Five" teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
American women Simone Biles is gymnastics on the floating beam during the women's individual multi-fight final in art gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win a multi-combat title and, overall, the fifth, while cementing her reputation to be the best of her generation, or even even.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who has brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 world champion medals - including 10 gold medals - with such amazing drills that include a mix of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton said of her that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."
She was expecting a final exam in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.
Not returning to the family in Spring, Texas with a handful of gold, would be considered a disappointment.
The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in each of the women's individual multi-fight finals in arts gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles picked up the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation point at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long road to the top, that's not really true.
Part of her flooring - which includes her typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the road outside the Olympic Arena in Rio.
That's not a coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a young child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman's mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman was training, became the force.
She hasn't lost a multi-combat competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina led through two twists slightly, the picture was deceptive.
Floating beams and ground gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked.
She picked up again with 15,433 on the floating beam - and put another one on it with a 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently embraced her as she expected her final performance - a pure formality - and tears poured on Bile's glossy red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collective book became a reality.
Raisman's performance was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a tiebrake.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "granny" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her ground exercise, she threw kissing hands to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed doubtful.
As for Biles, the 19-year-old's rapidly spreading tweet from earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot dead in serial killer case while listening to music in car
According to police reports released Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead who died in one of the deadliest attacks in a decade in Phoenix's first serial killer case while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Elli's daughter Maleah became on 12. June shot while the car was parked in a driveway, authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle, can be read in the report.
Police said the triple murder did not appear to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix Sgt police spokesman. Jonathan Howard said the shooting enticed investigators to get a closer look at whether it is linked to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks within four months, mainly in Hispanic residential areas.
"It's happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose the evidence they led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Elli's daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and is believed to have been the serial killer's work.
Investigators found bullet casings and secured a bullet from the seat as well as bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: 'It's getting better'
Like most 6-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But like the fewest of his peers, Edmund microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, I can't do this.
I can't do this.
I didn't get involved in that.
Which isn't true at all -- of course you got into it," she said.
Her husband Vincent and her were told that Edmund might never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest they institutionalize him.
"My first response to that was, 'I didn't know people were still doing this,'" Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until he was three years old and he still cannot speak.
But he is slowly making progress.
He can walk and ride a bike with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund came up with for "Please sing something to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some signs alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic as in Edmund, as well as infections with viruses such as measles or the zikavirus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and prognosis may vary greatly.
It is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zikavirus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still still doesn't really know.
I haven't asked for the forecast for a long time because I don't expect anyone to really tell me.
But Picciuto has hopeful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zikavirus.
It's getting better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rains, flooding gives cause for rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi flooded their banks, threatening large-scale flooding after extreme rains, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance to the affected communities is already on the way.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said requests for flood vehicles, boats and sandbags increased.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had requested ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be deployed over large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, are likely to reach record levels over the weekend.
Meterologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many homes in suburban neighborhoods near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will flow only slowly into Lake Maurepas via the rivers that have thrown.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday as early as 09.00.
Rescue teams still plucked people from the floodwaters in the Amite and Wilkinson neighborhoods of southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and his stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says water from Beaver Creek, which is usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson who lives nearby had warned him.
"We woke up and the water poured and poured in," Hansford said.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who can swim.
Hansford said emergency workers had rescued all three in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said the flooding had "spread rapidly" as there continued to be heavy rains and that authorities were considering evacuation instructions.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground had been significantly full of rainfall since Wednesday.
Authorities said heavy rains and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and class failures in five school districts.
CBS subsidiary broadcaster WWL reported that an associate in Tangipahoa indicated 200 flooded homes.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, both of which have now been flooded.
The head of the community of Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets washed up by the floodwaters.
Emergency shelters have been set up in the cities of Amite and Hammond to house the evacuees.
"Once the water starts to go back, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond of the municipality of Tangipahoa, almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flooding and sandbags were provided for residents to take along, who hope to keep the water out of their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city government.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison County's emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his data, a handful of homes were said to have been reported as flooded on Thursday, but none have been reported so far on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "perforated by bullets," survives shooting in Philadelphia
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week for the second time a 6-year-old child has been shot.
The boy's grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
The grandparents said Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including in the loin, leg, arm and stomach, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his little body was punctured by bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe that.
The boy's condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several surgeries.
The boy's family told the station that he is expected to recover.
He should have started the first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in Germantown.
Also shot were three men: two at the age of 29 and a 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot in the front seat of a car along with the 29-year-old, who is in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car and police are currently investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several gunmen.
Cartridge casings for assault rifles traced to various assault rifles swept the scene of the crime.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on either side of the walkway, were pods.
So there seems to have been several armed fighters here who were very actively involved," police skin man Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police station.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
No arrests were made and police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a crossbar on her arm as she played outside her home in the West Oak Lane residential neighborhood.
She is recovering and police are still searching for a suspect.
Which is why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That's what I imagine under the women's Olympics team in gymnastics and for more than a reason.
First, I've been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly, this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who seemed inspiring to many young girls of different skin color.
The structure of this squad, which is Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, rounds off makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnasts has been an African-American.
Last year was Simone and Gabby #1 and #2.
That shows strength.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and America cheered.
Now the world has been able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected yet masterful gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American to win gold at an individual multi-combat event for women.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We are witnessing the top of this sport, but that's not what gymnastics classes across the country look like.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all took the same path as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.
They are the "Last Five" because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. In addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for the training, furnishing, clothing, clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families). The list can be continued as desired.
The majority of these gymnastics clubs lie in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both coached their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to allow the communities of countless, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, a more affordable and easily accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my gymnastics foundation of 20 years.
At my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to provide the youth with high-quality gymnastics that deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits and academic and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that leads thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that is great.
It's so important to participate in the sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real portrayal of "Girl Power" by picking up the Olympic team gold and thank you, so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to begin their way, to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Resident doctors would like to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 residents who voted in an election rejected him.
In July, Hunt had unveiled plans to forcibly introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in a "no-man's land" and any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first resident doctors are to receive a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Committee of Residents, said in a statement last night: "Assistance physicians still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and refrain from treating all physicians fairly."
At just eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve the disputes through talks met with reluctance to join the government and sometimes to deafening silence.
That happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt had made last month about his door always being open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the resident doctors."
Should he fail to do so, the resident doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further industrial action.
The last strike at the end of April provided for a postponement of almost 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved in order to provide cover for doctors on the strike line chain.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better weekend pay for the 54,000 resident doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of the NHS staff, urged the residents to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Labour dispute measures do not achieve anything that little, but already burden overwork teams and service providers and only cause concern, hardship and interruption to the patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Residents and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other ministries for concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing.
Employers hoped that continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a time-out, training boxes, mutual recognition of curriculum, continuing education leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious the employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were about compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
The £2- per day medication that can lower heart attack risk
Thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from one £2- per day drug after it was recommended by authorities to administer this to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is given as early as 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
The NHS's regulatory agency NICE has recommended a four-year-long take to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
The NHS's regulatory agency NICE has recommended a four-year-long take to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form coverings.
If the topping breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that clogs blood flow to the heart, thereby causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and is distributed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
NICE's instruction draft, released today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE health technology evaluation centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all individuals who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."
Fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person’s quality of life.
Experience shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Through a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit.
Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. The instruction design does not recommend treatment that goes beyond this period.
Culture of Political Correctness Makes Election Fraud Flourish in Muslim Areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption charges
A culture of political correctness has led to the fact that widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored, as a damning government report revealed today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of election abuse due to "hypersensitities to ethnicity and religion."
The former minister of integration and local government, who is now an ant-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that police should be allowed to set up barrier tapes outside voting booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an ID card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At the moment, a voter only has to give his name and address.
The report suggests applying non-removable ink to a person's finger when casting their electoral vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He calls for the press to have more access to community records and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.
"This is not only to serve against election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Lutfur Rahman should be stripped of his office after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman would have "cynically perverted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community, and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia allegations.
Rahman is said to have "led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of an imitation in which one person chooses as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular alarm on fraudulent mail-in voting - in which older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including running IDs to prove identity
His report states: "As evidence, it was appropriate that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.
"There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivities regarding ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric issued 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban on political activists processing mail-in ballot papers to stop "electoral crops."
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral directory from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before the election.
Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once they cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks on a person's nationality to ensure they are eligible to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic mail-in voting.
Ban on political activists processing full mail-in ballots and envelopes of mail-in ballots.
Give police the authority to set up barriers around election stations.
A change in the law that facilitates an intimidation charge under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Ban on photography in election stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations (except for Wales).
Intensification of training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go to the voting booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that no criminal charges have been filed after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The electoral court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty of sufficient - in accordance with the high requirements in criminal proceedings - due to a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the ineffective "check-in checks" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "The court ruling in Tower Hamlets from last year was a warning signal.
Our country, as the mother of parliaments, bears a proud legacy, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for Kate's cyclist doppelganger and other famous doppelgangers of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio have come out of the way this week about French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, which has proved to be an impressive doppelganger of the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-fighting athlete this summer to feature his own famous doppelganger - at least not if you're allowed to believe social media.
In honor of the Rio Olympics and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has created a list of Olympians who bear more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the U.S. team in archery Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the racecourse, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer might be the twin of A-celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
The U.S. team member in archery Brady Ellison has caused a rush on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star emerged.
In fact, the archer got the madness on social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I myself don't see much similarity, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess I can take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take the spotlight even more this year: the all-round resemblance between British long jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her big, expressive eyes should be able to go through as a doppelganger for the Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
A gear higher: This user is of the opinion that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison has been drawn between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who features similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more than just the suntanned skin and blonde hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: Football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put into the room: According to this user, there may be a reason for the similarity of the couple
A Twitter user explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are nearly identical."
In fact, U.S. soccer star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is nearly identical to that of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist in gymnastics Gabby Douglas, who features her own beautiful, broad smile, which is similar to that of Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC commentator for the Olympics apologizes for his statement that Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth-place finish at the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay outraged by viewers of Wednesday's CBC live broadcast of the Olmyp Games
Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "went off like Mief" and during the race like "a pig died."
Commentator Byron MacDonalds thought his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board to the commentator team of the CBS to add more "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
Too excited, went off like Mief, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, allowing Canadians to catch the gap with China.
Viewers across Canada responded quickly online after being shocked by the tone and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China "died like a pig"????
The idiot didn't realize they were still on air.'
Ai Yanhan from China was described in the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman has lost the connection, baby."
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, in which many confronted him
Twitter users didn't hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote: "Wow, #ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. #angekelt.
A short time later, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize for the comment about a swimming performance airing."
It was an unfortunately chosen formulation, we're sorry it happened.'
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to the people who responded to the note via Twitter
Commentator Scott Russell had to apologise on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added his apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments
The network also quickly apologized and issued a message.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
We quickly apologized to our viewers last night on air and our followers on social media.
To clarify one thing, Byron's comments related to the swimmer's performance rather than her as a person.
Still, they were inappropriate and an unhappily chosen phrase. Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the broadcast, trying to justify his remark by testifying that it was not his intention to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's swimming squad in the CBC Olympics show," he said.
"I was referring to the swimmer's performance and not to her as a person."
Of course, no contempt was intentional and I am very sorry."
Buyer in Primark outraged by woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of the store
Buyers didn't know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try on underpants.
To make the situation worse, she patterned how she looked in it, took her off and put her back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried on four pairs of underpants at a store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on the underpants before putting them back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on the underwear, "she got back on and left the business without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underpants out of the display, took off her own tights and trousers and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheekily like Oskar."
"Everyone was staring as she took off the underpants again, which she obviously didn't like, as she put them back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three more underpants before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, got back on and walked out.
"She didn't seem to mind that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who might be buying the underpants she'd tried on."
Ms. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underpants that another person was wearing and who were not washed."
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added: "As I've heard, the staff have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman was wearing them and taking them off again and they weren't washed."
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is of the incident that settled on Tuesday, the 9th. August at our branch in Folkstone occurred, consciously."
All the products in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Against Weapons Attacks with Krav Maga
The world out is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, a grandmaster of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at a distance.
Whether you are approaching from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your predator.
If you're approaching from behind, the first thing you should be to turn around, so you can see your attacker and "go out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Then grab the weapon between your front arm and your shoulder before you punch it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him with your knee in the groin and twist the gun out of his hands while the attacker is curling up in pain. Hit him in the face with the run and move backwards while they point the gun at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the gun and twist it so the attacker can't shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight to the gun and hit the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun out of his handle before moving backwards and pointing the gun at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly how it pretends to Mizrachi.
But remember that in a robbery, it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for a guidebook
A British traveler subjected his immune system and strangler reflex to a serious test - by licking some of Europe's dirtiest and most disgusting places.
Presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his turn on a euro bill, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink button of a train toilet, and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he will get involved in.
But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to light.
The thought of licking the sink button of a train toilet that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his journey through Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about promoting gut bacteria as well as his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left anything more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known to test the resilience of his gut by traveling the world and ate peculiar and wonderful things.
From public railings at train stations to flushing buttons of toilets, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film, he recounted: "Already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film, he definitely lived up to his reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His test swab showed a luminometer number of over 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick off after its luminometer count was over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one in less than 60
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
In the film, he says, "That comes close to the worst I smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything here because it's disgusting in here.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.
We performed crazy brainstormings that ended with us saying "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we have been able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where this was quite difficult.
I'm glad we recorded some of those dirty treats on film.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all respondents associated with lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally use products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria.
Anti-social family destroyed before delogation social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their social housing after a delogation with a £50,000 damage for terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their estate, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden floorboards were ripped open, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family has been resettled and it is believed to now live in private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she fears the apartment would no longer be repairable.
She said: "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live that way.
There are many things to consider, as this property will presumably be considered a not-so-nice part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons, who meanwhile lived in the apartment and police said the terror the family had inflicted involved street fighting with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, arguing and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an order for anti-social behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
The wooden floorboards were torn open in the estate where drugs were traded in the past
Neighbors testified that they saw them fighting in the street and regularly the police had to be called
Cornwall Housing forcibly delogated her and her partner from the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The delogation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said their lives were made hell.
One testified, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times we're telling the police here are incredible.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to that!
Now that they're finally gone, it's going to be nice.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Cornwall Housing's Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager, testified that it had failed the family to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which police were called at regular intervals for 20 years
On the overgrown side of the town hall, garbage and old toys were thrown down
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, since a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be terribly visible to their neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who bravely approached us and sent us the information, did.
I hope that this development will give some neighbors comfort and convey the message that anti-social behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the house's bedrooms after delogation
House management workers will now have to clear away piles of garbage that surround the house
In 2014, police carried out a raid on the house and found over 70g of cannabis, as well as scales, paraphernalia and cash of £1,700.
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to possession of a Class B drug in commercial intent.
She claimed the money was for a tombstone of her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in a private shelter in Plymouth.
Many of the house's room walls were smeared with graffiti.
Police say they will delogate tenants who do not comply with the house rules
Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal in panic after a low-flying military jet overflows beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A Portuguese P-3C Orion Air Force aircraft laid down an incredible nosedive
Air forces said it was on a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk
This was the moment when terrified tourists start to panic after a low-flying jet crashes down over a full beach.
Dramatic video footage showed the military plane flying almost within reach over the sunbather on the beach section in Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped up as they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines without first seeing what was coming at them through the clouds.
The incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos about the dramatic fly-by on social media, said: "It really flew really deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was going to crash."
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on Aveiro beach were panicked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
Portuguese air forces today said that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats offshore and had to fly so low that this was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to nearby surface fires, but air forces insisted that safety was not at risk at any time.
Area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer, in which four people also died on the island of Madeira.
Portuguese air forces today said the pilot had to fly so low due to the conditions - heavy fog and incendiary smoke - which restricted his visibility
The plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Supercup: Barca with worries against Sevilla
Sevilla - FC Barcelona are fighting for their first step to their first title win in the new football season on Sunday.
The Catalans will compete in the duel for the Spanish Supercup away against FC Sevilla, the return match rises three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner has to do without Neymar, who contests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, in the battle of forces with the inferior Cup finalist and reigning Europa League champion among others.
In addition, goalie Marc-Andre ter Stegen is also missing.
The German suffered a ligament compression in his knee in training, which has cleared the one-way question at Barca, at least for the time being, in favor of Claudio Bravo.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been vying for the number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique has so far renounced a clear decision in this regard and let Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most other competitions.
Before the first mandatory game of the new season, there are doubts about the fitness condition of the team, which was humiliated on Saturday in a test match by Liverpool with 0:4.
Even at the 3:2 in the trial gallop against Sampdoria on Wednesday, Lionel Messi and Co. did not really know how to convince.
Sevilla, in turn, have to digest the 2:3 defeat after extra time in the European Super Cup against Real Madrid and are aiming for the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
Barcelona are the record winners in this competition with eleven successes so far.
Ma Long in its own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "title defender" Zhang Jike 4:0 (12.5.4.4) in a one-sided final in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday.
The world ranking first won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at the World Cup, World Cup, World Tour final tournament and just Olympia.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese made it to the final as expected and made up the title among themselves.
Thus, it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would win the individual title in the sign of the Five Rings.
The last non-Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SVS-NÖ legionnaire Ryu Seung-min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, between the sentences and time-outs they had no coaches with them.
They had retired to the grandstand and let go of their protégés in a fair competition alone.
"I've played the matches so far for my country."
"In the final I play for myself," Zhang had said logically.
After the match, gold and silver medalists posed with the China flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to really struggle with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set.
After that, he set the pace on the record and left Zhang with only a total of 13 points.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected rousing match did not develop.
But nevertheless, there were enough breathtaking ball changes to be seen.
Mizutani won the match for bronze against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4:1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarter-final against the German European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was in medical treatment afterwards, had to "ultimately" settle for sheet metal.
By the way, the Swedes Jan-Ove Waldner (38/2004) and Jörgen Persson (42/2008) had become Olympic fourth in similarly high table tennis age.
Donald Trump admits 'powerful problems' in election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive worries about losing their majority even in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted to weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the usually large-scale and confident multi-millionaire expressed something like concerns, as correspondents reported.
After throwing 16 rivals out of the race within his own Republican camp, doubts are now growing about his success in the battle for the White House.
"We have tremendous problems in Utah," Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida or Virginia.
Fault is false reports about his candidacy, he resumed his well-known media scolding.
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for Republicans.
According to a June poll by SurveyUSA, Trump and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton were on par.
Other institutes see Trump ahead, but not with the distance that is common for Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also at risk.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump replied to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton again: "Just like I've done so far."
And pushed afterwards: This will "either be successful, or I will take a very very nice, long holiday".
He does nothing but "tell the truth."
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good lifestyle.
According to press reports, the party is said to have threatened Trump to cut funds in support of his election campaign should he not be able to present better poll numbers.
Instead, we want to help the Republican candidates for Congress.
Olympics: Brazen fraud on doping test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya's athletes face uncomfort after second doping affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
After a fraud attempt at a doping check in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee said it would promptly set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had said that the former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping inspectors.
The world governing body IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case to initiate its own investigations, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) has gone to the doping control station and issued as Ferguson Rotich, handing in the rehearsal and signing," Kenya's chief executive de mission Stephan Arap Soi explained.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the World Anti-Doping Agency's training controls.
Ferguson Rotich had finished World Cup fourth over 800 metres in Beijing in 2015.
Four days earlier, Kenyan athletics delegation chief Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games.
He is alleged to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming doping tests against money payments.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return at Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special scrutiny at the IOC for a long time after numerous doping offenses.
In announcing the more than 2000 doping target checks launched by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was unusually previously pointed out that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular are being targeted.
The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system before the Summer Games in Brazil.
The law was passed a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.
Subsequently, WADA took Kenya off the list of countries whose doping control is compliant with WADA's rules.
Kenya is considered a great runner nation.
The country's athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing.
In a series of television reports of the ARD, accusations have been repeatedly made that in Kenya doping funds are easily accessible and there should be a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound most recently called for a similar investigation into Kenya as he had employed in Russian athletics.
It could be proven that in this sport was doped nationwide and systematically.
Russia's athletes were subsequently banned from the Summer Games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In the Shakespeare year, the Salzburg Festival presents the "West Side Story" with Tony and Maria as a tragic love couple, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story," Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the Temple of Classical Music and fulfilled a youthful dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra, conducted by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and tune.
It is a wonderful mix, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!
In this production, Bartoli plays an older Mary.
She remembers her love affair with Tony, while the younger Mary plays and dances.
I have always been fascinated by the role of Mary.
First, because it is musically exceptional!
And then there's Maria's personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."
So she's smart, of course, also naive, and very passionate.
"She's very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honor for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli gives back the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every one of his movements, in his gaze, it's his life!
It's such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For the American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" highly topical: "This piece is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, back then the Puerto Ricans went to New York, and the New York residents didn't want them.
They are the same issues, and they are just as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later, the play is still relevant.
London schoolgirl joining IS was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London to join IS last year, reportedly died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
It was thought to have been killed by a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's bulwark in the country, ITV News reported Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England, according to her family.
"One can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going to a war zone -- stopping people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls boarded a plane to Turkey from east London and then to a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family has been told she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain as a candidate for the Supreme Court in the event of an election victory at Garland
Harry Reid, leader of the Senate Democrats, is convinced that the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is of the opinion that the next president will appoint the successor to the late judge in the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.
Speaking Thursday during a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he expected to select Garland from Clinton "with some degree of certainty."
A spokeswoman for Reid later said that he had not yet spoken to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.
He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not cause unrest with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief justice of the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked the Garland nomination were lackeys and aid workers to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also noted that Donald Trump was unsuitable for presidential office.
Treats wants nude calendar for 'women and for men'
Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli-inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their NU Muses Kalendar for 2017.
The editor-in-chief of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine differed from old-school playboys since "Playboy is for men."
I'm doing this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the portrayal of timeless and classic nudity, where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the Kalendar's release.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person on open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass flight
"Whoever does not adapt and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-related Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun.
The Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of people seeking protection from Turkey to flee to Germany in the short term.
In the medium term, it could even be "a few hundred thousand," believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Because of the harsh crackdown by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term, I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand people seeking protection from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," the association's chairman Ali Toprak told the "Welt" on Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were on the run.
After the foiled coup, secular and opposition ethnic Turks would be added.
Many will want to start over in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It cannot be that a state that takes in refugees itself produces refugees in its own country," Toprak said.
The head of the association complained about the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
"They are the last major minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been exterminated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU.
The head of the association demanded that the German government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters."
In Germany, too, a "witch hunt" against Erdogan critics is taking place.
I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opposition figures.
The branding as a Gülen supporter destroys the professional existence of teachers and other academics.
"Those who do not adapt and praise Erdogan sit on packed suitcases, including the Kemalists and seculars," Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen-related Dialogue and Education Foundation, told the "World."
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks already provided the largest group of asylum-seekers recognized because of political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of the cut-off date 30. June, this was 11,386 people and thus almost 29 percent of all those recognized as asylum (39,625).
In this survey, the people who fled from war, poverty or lack of perspective do not find themselves.
According to the Basic Law, individual persecuted persons are exclusively politically, i.e. from the state side.
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: "Going where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: The locals get nothing from the summer election campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.
In 2021, the state election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it's not stupider than before: summer holidays, heat and state election campaign - that bites.
The locals, who are to be persuaded by the election campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so they are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.
In addition, there are practical problems: During the holidays, helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and in the end count votes are only laborious to find.
Until the 4. September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to endure another election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if you can even say that, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD/CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
It is exciting how strongly newcomer AfD performs and what is left in the end coalition-ready.
Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, is making an almost inconspicuous election campaign, apart from his large posters.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendaryly wordy predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet and blames Chancellor Merkel for the AfD's blossoming.
Their refugee policy, their "We can do this" has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office now.
The CDU, with its top candidate, Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already witnessed what it's like to campaign at the wrong time in the right place.
She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to major rallies; Merkel's federal constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburger and Vorpommern.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, secretary general of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR.
But it also does not hurt anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stalls on marketplaces and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
This, says Kokert, only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union has also noticed that it is crumbling away the basis in the countryside, that it has to make a great effort to find a connection to the people again.
She is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly present in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU election campaigner Kokert to his colleagues is also self-debunking: "You have to go where it hurts, namely where the people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because a lot is at stake, Sellering has now called his SPD for a particularly committed election campaign.
In polls, the Social Democrats were last with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD had still clearly won with 35.6 percent ahead of the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the state parliament.
They make a modern virtue out of the holiday trouble and move their election campaign largely to the Internet.
"Online election campaign," state chairwoman Claudia Müller calls it.
Otherwise, green campaigners are going on a search for traces of local voters among the holidaymakers.
Silke Gajek, the top candidate, is currently curving through the Mecklenburg Lakes with a houseboat and finds it nice.
Her impression: "Electoral leave in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 refurbishment: Restaurants suffer from lockdown
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
For those responsible for the construction work, which starts at 5.30 in the morning and does not end until around 8 p.m., there is praise everywhere.
"They did everything pretty jagged," says Elvira Tetzlaff of the jet gas station.
This is a super team.
There's no delay either.
The construction site could be moved to the south at the beginning of the week at half-time, by the end of October everything should be ready.
The concession of those responsible for the construction work is also praised, for example when it comes to the establishment of makeshift entrances.
Since the construction site migrated south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has also been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg again exists, the traffic situation within the village has relaxed.
Citizens can now travel on both sides from Ofterdingen.
The avoidance traffic through the place seems to be receding.
"There were some significant complaints," says Florian King, deputy head of the office responsible for the traffic management of the renovation.
The residents of Bachsatzstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to deal with more traffic noise, because many sneaking paths were looking for each other and were more likely to trust their satnav than the signage.
Which led to some trucks fraying in residential areas.
Since the speed limits were also not met, the municipality increasingly requested the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There were significant overruns," says King, who once made himself aware of the situation on the ground.
Two to three per minute have already been flashed.
The fastest was travelling with 77 kilometres per hour in the Tempo-30 zone.
Since the construction site moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the business people on the B 27, it is only a small consolation that the road is now open again for customers from Rottenburg.
Business people do not like to be looked into the cards.
But that the B 27 renovation has led to revenue slumps in them, lets everyone you ask see through.
However, some are more and some less affected.
Those who have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. produce for other companies, have little consequence for the renovation.
Thomas Sulz also speaks of an "at most slight decline" at the car dealership Maier, but also admits that of course "the running customer base is missing".
The most affected are the restaurants along the road.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already existential.
Not only him, but all restaurants had hit it "hard."
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every euro turnover.
He estimates the revenue losses to be "well over 50 percent".
The road renovation had "thrown back his operation by two years."
He had to lay off half of his staff.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been laid off, the policy would have reacted differently.
Instead, in response to a request from Göhner, President Jörg Schmidt replied to whether there could be a financial compensation, with the indication that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the benefits of the situation on the B 27. Now it must also bear the disadvantages that result from the renovation.
Göhner knows from other counties where something like this has been handled more generously.
In all the complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, it refers to the long history.
He can understand that other regular guests are now less frequently stopping by because of the complicated traffic management.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
That his regular clientele will come back after the end of the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts about that.
Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the impact of the B 27 construction work on his clientele to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction work, that's brutal.
Laws are constantly being screwed on in the name of counterterrorism.
After the recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does a toleration status have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the conciliator.
All of his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior at the presentation of his new security package.
They're not overwhelming anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.
I also participate in this.
As interior minister, however, he was interested in results and a "reachable consensus" within the coalition.
De Maizière has allowed a little time to pass after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach before presenting his conclusions for security in the Republic.
But they are all the more extensive for this.
Some things are already known, announced, targeted: That a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new.
Nor the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to criminalize sympathy advertising for terrorist groups and to unbutton jihadists with dual citizenship the German passport.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU man.
Nevertheless, he thinks this is reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
They have it partly in them: He plans rapid procedures for deportations and more opportunities for the detention of people before deportation.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country should have their smartphones checked beforehand and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
In the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than before - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of it is politically and legally delicate.
Some things also seem infertile and leave questions open.
And on some points - in the unequal treatment of patients, for example - the question arises: What does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were worried about safety in view of the high number of refugees.
And things that deeply occupied the people could not be excluded even in election campaign times.
Internal security has come into enormous focus.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there are election campaigns.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly putting themselves in position on the issue of internal security.
In the past few days, it went high between the two parties.
First a nasty dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then over a security policy idea collection of some Union interior ministers, in which the heads of the department also demand a burqa ban and a departure from dual citizenship.
De Maizière also strives for conciliatory tones here.
He thinks nothing of a departure from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
Reopening them is not meaningful.
And in the case of a burqa ban, he has constitutional concerns.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner has yet to be revealed.
There's a lot in it that could cause a fight.
But the SPD is also currently trying to profile itself on the issue of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first cautiously signals a willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security".
Volkswagen is still getting through lightly.
Despite diesel scandals, delivery figures are rising worldwide.
But not all markets are running smoothly.
In the recall campaign, there are vortexes around a term.
Volkswagen is more relative to the second half of the year in terms of deliveries.
Europe's largest car manufacturer has continued to show a plus in the course of the year, despite the diesel affair, thanks to its many brands and some well-run markets.
But in July, the core VW brand weakened, especially in Western Europe, and thus again burdened the overall sale, as the company listed in the Dax announced.
In July, the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles worldwide with 449100 cars than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year.
In the home market of Germany, deliveries slumped by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales chief Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July mainly to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there has been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU has also burdened, explained a spokeswoman.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus to book.
The Chinese market is a major support for VW.
Overall, the mainly affected house mark of the Lower Saxony comes anyway further through the diesel scandal: After the first seven months, only a delivery reduction of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is recorded.
Group sales chief Fred Kappler was able to continue to show a sales increase from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, with 5,904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated exhaust gas tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW is calling for around 2.5 million cars to convert in the workshops.
In the course of the conversion, VW affirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative impact.
After the conversion of the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
The car manufacturer issued the customer after the conversion a "guarantee" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was said on Friday in company circles.
The reason is legal intricacies.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now grants its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
It was confirmed from the Department of Transportation that there was this meeting.
"VW must fully comply with the requirements of my commission of inquiry and the KBA."
"Deviations from this are not accepted," German Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) said, according to the ministry.
VW has assumed the guarantee that no deteriorations will occur in the case of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after the conversion and that all vehicle values relevant to the type approval will continue to exist.
Volkswagen itself does not use the term "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles.
With the broad term "guarantee", Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers, for example, come to a workshop half a year after the conversion, for example, with an engine failure - and could rely this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
Even in the customer's interest, it is important to avoid that in the case of any other damage that has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, there is uncertainty with regard to possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
That's why VW doesn't use the term "guarantee."
Raiffeisenbank Gmund am Tegernsee will demand penalty interest rates from rich savers in the future - as the second institute in Germany.
Bank chief Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It's only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros in current or daily money accounts."
The Federal Association of German Banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers "do not have to fear to pay for their savings penny penalty rates".
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty interest.
From September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of more than 100,000 euros back in current or daily cash accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future," Paul said.
He has been guarding 40 million euros for some time, which could be withdrawn from one day to the next and which he could not exploit.
"These are in my central bank account and incur 0.4 percent cost," the bank chief said.
"I can't put down for every million 4000 euros."
He now passes on the costs according to the polluter pays principle.
Just leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four robberies, I don't want the fifth!" said the bank board.
Most clients would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Bavarian Cooperative Association stated: "The ECB's extreme monetary policy course incurs significant costs for all banks".
To wear them alone is "not permanently possible in the business sector."
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or transfers.
With penalty interest on deposits starting at three million euros, Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land had made headlines with its 2014 Skatbank branch.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the Banking Association, said: "We do not expect that private customers will have to pay nationwide fees for deposits, and competition in Germany among banks and savings banks is far too strong".
One banker said there was "a clientele at Lake Tegernsee that is a little more lushly equipped by the fortune."
"This can become a problem for a small bank" if it guards money for free.
The cooperative bank Gmund, founded in 1911, has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach-Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The cooperative association Bavaria "is currently not aware of any other banks that charge a compensation for deposits of private customers," said spokesman Ernst.
The president of the Federal Association of German People's Banks and Raiffeisenbanken (BVR), Uwe Fröhlich, had declared at the end of June: "The threshold to go into negatives compared to the private customer is very, very high".
The competition is fierce, and it threatens the churn of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not like this in the broad.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lonely middle-aged men love plates.
Before you rush to the comment part to dot him with harsh insults under the pseudonym NonAllElonemenMedians, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much-advised resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical items, but due to midlife nostalgia.
Those who have recently purchased a plate are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 age group is the most unlikely buyer group.
It's also not a horde by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%.
But are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while running in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stubling wildly before I stop, holding my hands and saying something determinant like, "So, let's take a closer look."
So, let's take a look.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent vendors were based - there are still a handful of fantastic slab specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to the Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
He's a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I've got about. 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I didn't follow him home), dress out the walls of his living room.
The reason he owns such a significant number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford when they appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts and like to spend time on their own, adding: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
This is my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to the YouGov profile.
However, he has also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I've had, people have usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy themselves CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records again," he says.
That would explain the boom in supporters of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offence to the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.
"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez.
That's the way it is with me as a collector and I think it's like that for a lot of people.
It is an easy way to engage mentally.
"We're like their social workers!" an employee flutes from a plate pile.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that nearly 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a turntable they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don’t own a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (data count: three middle-aged men), has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone just came in here recently and said, "I don't own a turntable, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf," he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product-heavy, less music-heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a turntable."
These are younger people, not older people, who are only slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colorful audience when I go in.
There are couples around 70, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above-mentioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars out of the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but nagging psychic traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around the store for a few minutes, looking at the variety of records for sale.
She's doing a window-shopping stroll rather than a big shopping.
She doesn't earn much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is..." it drifts off with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My final stop is a store that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm appearing to be examining the jeans hotpants, I'm watching a group of young teenage girls cluster around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a stairwell, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just purely decorative, some so far up it's impossible to touch them.
It's pure "plate art."
But considering that every attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that a demographic that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like plates.
Even though my research revealed that YouGov’s results are correct, they, at least in record stores in Soho, disregard the large number of female collectors and record lovers who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or offices.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday tomorrow strolling through Berwick Street's record stores and flipping through plates, while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, 30-year-old fake presenter who towers over the shoulders of no-suspecting middle-aged men.
The Greenland Shark is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest lifespan of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the record was in a female that is thought to be between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects offer over demolition of shops in jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected an offer by authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be empowered to tear down 72 makeshift businesses where people within the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offering hairdressing services or selling tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in makeshift restaurants.
Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and that pose a fire and medical risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-backed association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also stated that the makeshift shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for expelling people running the 72 provisional businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of Calais' prefecture were "absolutely understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said the grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than merely feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the tearing down was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is operated non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum supplies for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
In a letter to the Guardian, it said the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The migrant's two aid agencies Help Refugees and L'Auberge estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number so far - after a steep increase in new arrivals over the course of the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time trial, professional cyclist Tony Martin does not want to let himself be brought down.
"I continue to keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," the 31-year-old wrote on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He does not have an explanation for his miserable 12th place on the Sugar Loaf.
"I honestly find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial," Martin said.
He had to analyse in peace what reasons had led to the debacle.
At the time trial World Cup in Qatar in October, Martin actually wanted to fight for the title.
"I'm going to look closely at everything we've changed in recent times."
"This also includes my position," wrote the three-time time trial world champion, who lost more than three minutes on the 54.5 km on Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday.
Olympics: Tennis pro Siegemund misses out on semi-final
Laura Siegemund's triumphal march ended in the quarter-finals of Rio: The world ranking 32nd from Metzingen missed by a 1:6, 1:6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico/WTA No.
34) the semi-finals of the Olympic tennis tournament clearly.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, was only able to get her serve through once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday, medal hope was Angelique Kerber (Kiel/No. 2) the chance to jump into the final round.
The Australian Open winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
As the last German tennis pro, Tommy Haas had won a medal (silver) in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB starters in the quarter-finals of the Summer Games had last been in 1992.
Never before has a German duo stood in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group joins start-up for live video game broadcasts
Watching other people play video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from this.
The technology group is buying the start-up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money is going for the takeover, Microsoft did not disclose on Thursday.
Beam only started with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but also intervene themselves.
For example, they can give up missions and confront players with enemies and provide equipment.
The player giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new HD video service for the booming world of e-sports.
On the way to the global media event, Facebook is supposed to help.
The advertising industry is already listening up.
Employees of the start-up, which has so far been based in Seattle in the US state of Washington, are moving to the Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, Beam co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi said.
For the customers, therefore, nothing should change through the takeover.
Beam will be integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console, according to Microsoft.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is currently growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube Gaming is part of Google’s Alphabet.
Here is the Enforcement Trailer
Germany’s speeders must adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including in Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested, which are intended to transfer speed sinners particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailer from Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident centers, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at motorway construction sites or bridges to be renovated with a temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
However, a permanent mobile structure can be too dangerous or complicated.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem.
With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously across multiple tracks.
Variable speed limits as well as transit bans according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
In the high-speed state, according to the manufacturer, you can move the trailer with any car with a trailer hitch.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring mode, so that the wheels disappear in the armored and incidentally also bullet-proof outer casing.
In addition, a built-in alarm system is supposed to protect the speed camera from vandalism.
Since 2015, according to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states and is now also used.
Foreign authorities are also blitzing with the new technology: France recently reordered 100 pieces, after an order of 150 pieces last year.
UK picks up silver in 7-series rugby after Fiji Masterclass takes gold
Britain's impressive performance at 7 rugby came in at an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the Fijis' final on Thursday night when they were beaten with a result of 43-7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji awarded a masterclass in handling, side-stepping, re-enactment, line running and raw power to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat was sweetened by the not-too-bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in that tournament where they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The Boks's clear defeat, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day, could fall back on them in the final.
But regardless, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team at his best in that form.
It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.
GB had a difficult path behind it.
Eight years ago, they lost every game under Ryan at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This slack will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and bounced the attacks of GB for fun.
It felt like captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running into moving buses. The World Series winners went up 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau heated over in the corner.
With four more minutes of play, Jerry Tuwai added yet another attack from the right corner, which he converted.
12-0 and GB barely touched the ball.
An outstanding tackle from Mitchell stopped man Leone Nakarawa's mountain to score a third goal, but it just stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua put a touchdown in the right corner and it stood 0-17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou pressed through further weak tackles from the GB team and stormed up to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 until the break.
It's like Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB is still learning.
So it is.
GB made fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap...for a full four minutes, which was good for the circumstances of the first half until Josua Tuisova ran through after a brilliant interim play from Fiji.
Dan Norton started a try for GB, making a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game had long been in favor of the South Sea islanders, whose fans sang, waving flags and dancing in the stands.
It was not hard to admire Fiji's playful approach.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another try in the final seconds.
The whistle sounded, the fijis hugged and GB kicked crushingly in the turf.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-finals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a narrow semi-final match - Britain's conversion of the difference.
Kyle Brown put the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke the line through with an impressive footwork and scored a goal below the post in the second half.
A brilliant late-stalking tackle by Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother of the English 15-aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to row victory by fighting with the coach's cancer
There will be no more emotional gold than at these games and that means something.
From the first rowing to the last, 220 hard hieves that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams, was all-ensuing when they rowed to the second Olympic gold in the twosome without a helmswoman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a benchmark.
Her dominance was absolute, after all, her 39.ter unbeaten effort, which is also unprecedented.
What we see are two brilliant female athletes gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold in the rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference and it was no one more helpful than the coach who did not know 30 months ago if he would survive that day at all than he was diagnosed with cancer.
Like he said, he was a risky thing.
I had bladder cancer that's operable and they did.
If you don't, he'll spread everywhere.
It would have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes a bit of the outlook.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that they could start treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term at all in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to go better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and running around on the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice.
That's how it starts.
Rowing itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-wracking morning talking a little more than usual and trying to process his own fears.
Stanning, who was as a captain at the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
It only repeats how much that means to me, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked.
It's been three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn't be anyone, so a massive thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have wished for a better person to train or a better coach.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a tough rhythm that their opponents couldn't keep up with.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started catching up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very trapped at the moment.
Helen shouted "stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we weren't looking to do anything great.
We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover must be out at a wedding next week, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say that was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
In London, it took around six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
That feels so much better," she said.
Provided for 31 years exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, is retiring.
The association is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers.
So it was some time ago in the original tone in a contribution of the Bavarian radio.
A little later, the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the Zweckverband.
The work of the Veitenstein Group was considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this is Rupert Göller, who was an employee for 31 years in the Zweckverband, of which 28 years as managing director.
He has now retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water purpose association of the Veitenstein Group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes about 150000 cubic meters of water annually and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.
Member municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.
There are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities.
The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn's mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was hired as water attendant in 1985 and appointed managing director of the Zweckverband as early as 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse and they ranged from water pipeline construction and maintenance work to office and organizational activities, budget preparation, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency deployments on weekends," the chairwoman said.
She cited the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchases in the area of the new wells (1998) and compensation for the farmers, the rehabilitation of the high tanks (1999), the new acquisition of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renewals of water pipes.
There was no standstill and innovations were repeatedly taken up because water meant life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudation, she praised Göller's faithful, reliable and correct service over 31 years.
He has worked with a lot of passion for his water purpose association and he has lived the water purpose association as if it were his own company.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group for nitrate reduction in front of the water forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He received a lot of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller, for his part, praised water warden Alfons Griebel, who had worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water attendant and he was a faithful squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
From his point of view, he described the construction of wells and the restructuring of the special purpose association as highlights.
The biggest challenge and the most difficult use, however, were the pipe break at the high tank at Kirchlauter on a 3. January.
Here would have to work at minus 17 degrees all night long so that the villages could be supplied with water.
The supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the high container from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the drinking water association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko is openly dealing with her son Tiago's autism - and turns to other affected parents: "They must have the courage to talk about it."
"The medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was detected in her son, she believed that she had to die.
The now eight-year-old Tiago, however, has progressed well and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that was two years ago when I was singing at Milan's Scala, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest person on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Relationship act in Bargteheide - man shoots at partner
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner on Friday at about 10.45 a.m. in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn County) and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and indicated he had shot his partner," a police spokeswoman said.
The perpetrator is on the run, after him is publicly searched.
Meanwhile nationwide, because Sven S. could be traveling by car.
The man is about 1.80 metres tall, muscular, tanned and has a bald head.
Meanwhile, police have released a photo of him.
It is a few years old, however.
Meanwhile, the man is wearing a bald head.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the gun with him, according to police.
Anyone who sees Sven S. should call the 110.
The police are talking about a "relationship act."
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
The responsible police in Lübeck initially did not want to provide information on the crime or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, it confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It's a homicide."
"That's all we're saying at the moment," a police spokeswoman in Lübeck said.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was at the scene.
Steel - Bright spot for German steel industry
The crisis-ridden and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in the millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry from green electricity funding are off the table.
It remains with the exemption from the renewable energy levy at the existing plants for the so-called in-house electricity production in the German steel industry, German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) told the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I'm really glad that we were finally able to achieve that after two years of tough negotiations."
The European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers, which use gas from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, to pay.
The steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year, according to the German industry association.
Gabriel told the WAZ there was now a fundamental agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steel mills are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent is incurred.
But even this is not collected in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed Germany’s agreement with the EU Commission on self-generating electricity.
This largely stipulates the status quo of the previous regulation.
Gabriel’s successful effort for the steel industry is of particular importance.
"With regard to our 'Steel is the future' campaign, this is a first step."
"More must follow."
"Climate and employment targets must also be weighed in the reform of emissions trading," explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has suffered from overcapacity and significant price pressures since the 2008 financial crisis.
Last year, the situation intensified further when the world’s largest producer country, China, threw mass steel on the world market in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European manufacturers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
Over the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import tariffs on import steel are having an effect, and on the other hand, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry prime minister Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
Recently, the prices would have stagnated again.
The industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp also did not want to rule out closures of individual plants.
Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steelmakers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders.
They produced a good six percent less crude steel with 3.4 million tons than in the same month last year, as the economic association Stahl announced on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the amount produced now declined for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent lower than in the previous year.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, mind, health: singing is good for seniors
Ursel Kipp has accompanied singing her entire life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in her teaching studies she took over the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.
After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.
By the way, she is doing something good for her health and her mind.
Because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League.
Most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, Hackler describes.
Through regular togetherness, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also had this experience in her choir: "To speak out and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.
Those who regularly demand their lungs do not get out of breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens’ Organizations.
In the older generations, singing together had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia remember long past events.
When singing, the head is also required to perform particularly, explains Lenz.
To focus simultaneously on your own voice and on a predetermined rhythm and adapting to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.
Especially older people who live alone practice not only to focus on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience by singing in the choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show myself: If I practice for something for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So good reasons to start singing, there are enough.
If you want to try a new hobby, you should not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears when a sound goes wrong?
In search of the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, you can just join in.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
If you want to sing in a church choir, you can contact the congregation or the church leader directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found via the Internet.
Those who do not have access to the Internet can ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with Internet research.
If you want to sing, you should definitely join a choir, advises Hackler.
Singing does the soul good and has something liberating - that's true for all ages.
Cats react more sensitively than hangovers to cry of the young
Biologists in Hanover have investigated the effect of calling cat babies for adult animals.
To her surprise, the meowing did not leave the males cold - but in contrast to the females, they always behaved the same.
Female cats can recognize the level of arousal of cat babies by the meowing of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to sounds of kittens who imagine themselves in great need, as scientists from the University of Veterinary Medicine and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have found out.
Cats also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Apparently, the acoustic differences between the meowing of less and highly aroused young animals are either imperceptible or insignificant for the males," said biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.
She is the first author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kitten screams differed with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult hangovers and eight cats from the animal husbandry of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, they were played with shouts from little ones who were taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more aroused kittens, which were additionally lifted up.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who did not yet have their own offspring, reacted differentiatedly to the screams," Konerding said.
They turned to the speaker faster when this call of the very more aroused kittens played.
This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.
"One surprise was that the males reacted at all," the biologist said.
In the past, scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men to baby noises on several occasions in humans.
Also, some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, regardless of whether they were already mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with 'Gala'
Hakan Sükür is a football legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time after the coup attempt, an important football match will take place in Turkey again.
Before the duel of the arch-rivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolski's Galatasaray Istanbul for the Supercup in Konya, the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was impeded after the overthrow attempt in July, the government asserted that the everyday life of ordinary citizens should not be affected.
However, this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed for the coup attempt.
There is no stopping before football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former star ticker Hakan Sükür.
The Sükür, who now lives in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is said to be supporter of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is blamed by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the state of emergency, which was initially imposed for 90 days, is still valid until October, this actually has almost no effect on the life of most Turks.
The nightly "democracy guards" in public places across the country declared Erdogan over on Wednesday.
The sport - like the whole country - is divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the working class club Besiktas traditionally do not count among the friends of the president.
What unites the majority of Turks, however, in the face of dramatic experiences in history, is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree on themselves - regardless of whether their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
With cup winner "Gala" it will be especially important again to Lukas Podolski.
The Cologne player proved his sporting value last season: With 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final match against Fenerbahce, he scored the 1:0 victory.
The magazine "Fanatik" cheered him: "He was the best on the court."
He has completed the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi," the disappointing season for the record champion found a conciliatory conclusion.
After the preliminary round knockout in the Champions League, the "Lions" also retired early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig, it was only enough to rank sixth.
The season was not good.
The Cup was the only way to win something.
"That's what we managed to do and that's the most important thing," Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas, the game year went better.
Especially thanks to Mario Gomez, who with 26 goals of the season as the Süper-Lig goalscoring king the base for the 14th. Title laid.
That's also why fans continue to hope for the 31-year-old's return.
The contract with AC Florence and only borrowed from Besiktas Gomez had announced after the coup attempt, because of the political situation in the country not to return after his European Championship holiday.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it," the trade magazine "Kicker" quoted club boss Fikret Orman as saying.
But the striker would have to be willing to forgo around a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We can't pay his salary at Florence".
Despite doping: These athletes still have medal chances at Olympics in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they are fighting for medals in Rio.
The issue of doping continues to determine the headlines at the Rio Olympics.
Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had sued her right to start shortly before the Games after a doping ban, was mercilessly whistled and booed at her start (100 metres breaststroke).
It was a whimsical scene: With a smile she was still proud in the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was clear that she would not get gold, the audience broke out into a cheering storm.
But there are numerous other athletes who compete in the Rio Olympics despite the doping past.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100m relay/USA): The 34-year-old is among the most controversial figures in athletics.
He was already banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and ex-world champion has been running even faster than before, he is the world number one in 9.80 seconds over 100 m and is considered the biggest challenger to Usain Bolt.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce (100, 4x100-m relay/Jamaica): The two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion had to sit out a six-month lock in 2010 after she was proven to take the painkiller oxycodone.
She had severe toothache after an operation, the 29-year-old defended.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus/Croatia): In 2011, the Olympic champion of 2012, world champion of 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied knowingly taking the proceeds and was banned for six months.
The four widest throws this year go to the account of the big gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400-m relay/USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, had tested positive in 2010 and was banned for 21 months.
A means of penis enlargement was responsible, Merritt asserted.
This year, the 30-year-old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m.
Iwan Tichon (hammer throw, Belarus): Hardly any athlete was subsequently deprived of so many medals.
So Tichon lost his 2005 World Championship title nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The now 40-year-old also had to give up Olympic silver in 2004 because of steroid doping and the 2006 European Championship title due to testosterone abuse.
He received back the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games, which was also revoked, on the basis of a judgment of the International Court of Sport CAS.
With 80.04 m he is in second place in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walking, China): The world record holder and gold favorite did not test positive until May, but is still allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion was found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the ban of the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and ran on the 13th. July off.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian woman injured - Several dead
The Austrian Embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, Foreign Ministry spokesman Thomas Schnöll said Friday morning.
She had suffered lacerations and was treated in the hospital, but had already been able to leave it again.
She planned her journey home for the beginning of September.
Whether the further explosions on the holiday island of Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon are also affected by Austrian citizens is still unclear for the time being.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities in this regard, according to Schnöll.
In Hua Hin, about 200 kilometers south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs had exploded in a nightlife district on Thursday evening.
According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
On Friday morning, two explosive devices went up again, while according to the authorities, another person was killed.
A bomb blast was also reported from Phuket in the morning.
A taxi driver was injured in the detonation near the popular beach Patong with holidaymakers, according to police.
In Surat Thani on the southeast coast of the country, another bomb exploded, which killed a municipal employee.
The explosive device, according to the authorities, in a flower bed in front of the area of the coastal police.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast, as well as in Chumphon on the southeast coast, claimed several injured.
It is believed to be related to the explosions in Hua Hin, it said.
"The bombings bear the same handwriting," army general Danai Kritmethavee told reporters Friday morning.
“We believe it’s a coordinated attack.”
It is too early to comment on possible motives, but it is likely to be the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said the attacks were not related to the Islamist insurgency movement or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage limited to limited areas and provinces," a Bangkok spokesman said.
Rather, it is assumed that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.
In recent days, the authorities have received intelligence information on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and the places.
It is still unclear which group was behind the attacks.
Police instructed their officers across the country to step up security around major government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
There are always minor bombings in Thailand, but they are usually not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin lies a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage that the instructions of the Thai security authorities should be followed.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla, as well as Preah Vihear and the surrounding area.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim sections of the population, it is not recommended before unnecessary travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This will give the military great influence in the coming years.
Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves toward stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism.
The military unta, which seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is taking advantage of itself in having led the kingdom back to stability and order.
However, the military has also failed to get a grip on the Muslim rebel uprising that has been simmering in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Just under a year ago, 20 people were killed in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine in Bangkok, most of them foreign tourists.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country's recent history.
The right-wing "Identitarian Movement" has been targeted by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several state offices, the constitutional protectors in the federal government have also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitarian Movement' evidence of aspirations against the free democratic basic order," said Hans-Georg Maaßen, head of constitutional protection at the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Thus, immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are defamed in an extremist way.
That is why we are now watching the movement.
The "Identitarian Movement" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It opposes "multicultural delusions," "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's identity through over-foreigning."
Constitutionalists in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identitarians."
Maaßen said his authority had closely aligned with the state offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitarian Movement' are trying to pick up their target audience where it stands," the constitutional protection chief said.
In general, extremists try to address them with youth-friendly language, often with pop music.
Islamists as well as right-wing extremists do that.
This is not a good advertisement for your own cause.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
That's dangerous.
Most recently, there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "identitarians" with AfD politicians.
Maassen said he had no knowledge of that.
For the protection of the Constitution, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant at a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its target direction through certain people who are extremist and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is therefore whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This is not recognizable.
With regard to the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maaßen said he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
But we have found in previous years that there can be right-wing terrorist structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freitaler Group.
It may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or microgroups are forming, which are planning attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee shelters or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives.
However, a Germany-wide or Europe-wide control of right-wing terrorism is not discernible.
The previous groups were formed at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern that many assaults went to the account of people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That's the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum shelters were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or followers of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who may have been politically indifferent or, for example, elected the CDU, SPD or Left, but who then radicalized themselves through right-wing extremist sentiment."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes internet hit
The Olympians or world records do not always determine the headlines at the Olympics.
This is shown by the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer featured in the TV pictures.
He just disappeared - no matter how far the snippet was selected.
On social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finishes his lead with a backlog of 48 seconds and occupied the 59th. Place of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporting figure, which attracted the attention of the international media.
Why does the 24-year-old still take part in the Olympics?
The Ethiopian got a special starting right from the international swimming association.
This will be distributed to make swimming better known in underrepresented countries.
Since most of the athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media outlets described him as the "robel of whale."
In reference to a "wealth belly," the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod."
His time, he hit only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.
At the 2000 Sydney Olympics, Eric Moussambani's run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete in a preliminary over 100 meters freestyle alone.
Freetically, Moussambani was cheered on at the time.
The then 22-year-old only learned to swim eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Geretsried - The owner of a shop on the New Square has been robbed.
According to the police, the 67-year-old Geretsriederin had left her business around 5:30 p.m. on Monday, forgetting to close a window on the ground floor.
When she returned the next morning at around 8.15 a.m., about 250 euros had disappeared from the cash register.
Traces of the perpetrator could not be found.
There is also no video surveillance.
Trump doesn't see the looming election defeat so narrowly
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a campaign event in Florida.
Should it be nothing with the election as US president, Donald Trump already has an alternative idea.
He's going on vacation.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he would not care relatively: "Ultimately it will either work out, or I have a very, very nice, long vacation," the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If it is not enough for him in the end for reasons of political correctness, that is fine, Trump said.
He called U.S. President Barack Obama and Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton the founder of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party, more and more resistance has recently formed.
Post enters the trade in electric vans
An electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is apparently great.
The Post plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter as well.
The Group intends to start trading in the van shortly.
Post wants to offer its electric vans from next year also on the free car market.
"We want to get into the sale to third parties," a Post spokesman said on Friday.
The company has been examining for months whether it is to sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and parcels are delivered, to other establishments.
Post board member Jürgen Gerdes had said that there were always questions, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the Bonn-based company intends to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly.
In the postege production, the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year per shift.
Gerdes had announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and was aiming for a complete change to environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he had said at the end of July.
I can imagine us switching the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on Germany's streets since 2014.
GfK leadership steps down after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK exchanges its boss Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not entirely surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK suggested that the longer the successes promised by him, the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become more uncertain.
Turbulence at the head of the Nuremberg-based market research company GfK: After again disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world's number five in the industry is facing a new start in personnel.
GfK CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year.
The Chairman of the GfK Supervisory Board Arno Mahlert is already leaving with effect from 12. September from the Supervisory Board.
The leadership in the board already takes over at 1. The previous board member Gerhard Hausruckinger, the company said in a statement.
He is to officially assume the function of "board spokesman" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As a reason for the resignations, the company cited "different views" on the long-term business policy orientation.
A company spokesman did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future is currently still unclear.
In investor circles, it was said on Friday that the disappointment among the shareholders had recently been great about the continued lack of success of the restructuring initiated years ago.
Mr. Hartmann has been at the top of the GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring, however, are not yet to be seen even after 5 years," it said.
In view of the recently poor GfK business figures, every shareholder will eventually become uneasy.
"If that were the case with BMW, the Quandts would do the same," it said.
The company had not been able to stop its loss drive in the second quarter of 2016 after setbacks in the previous quarters.
At 361.2 million euros, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Based on the first half of the year, sales of 721.2 million euros shrank by 3.4 percent.
Profit in the second quarter has particularly weighed on the company's lower value given its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of 139 million euros, which became necessary in the Consumer Experience division, brought the bottom line a loss of 148.2 million euros.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK had still generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million.
Accidents - Bus slips into Krummhörn in Graben: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens as passengers, eight people were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (Aurich district).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, police said.
The 66-year-old driver of the bus of a travel company from Eisenach had to avoid an oncoming truck, which was partly on the oncoming road.
The bus came to the right of the road and slid into a ditch, a spokeswoman for the police Aurich/Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, the people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department freed the occupants.
Six ambulances and an emergency medical vehicle arrived at the scene of the accident on Landesstraße 2.
The uninjured travelers were taken by a scheduled bus back to the Krummhörner district of Pewsum.
There they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company.
Investigators urged the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to police.
The fees per cubic meter of wastewater are from 1. October 2016 for the area of the wastewater plant Neudorf/Reuth/Welschenkahl 3,44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg/Lindenberg/Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
After an overdifferable calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.
As Mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, when the budget was approved by the district office of Kulmbach, it was found that undercovers for these wastewater plants.
Due to legal basics, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants in a cost-covering manner.
From 1. In October 2016, the citizens as well as the commercial and industrial enterprises from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the wallet.
The fee increases range from 48 to 67 percent.
As the head of administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the panel, a recalculation of the fees for the sewage plants of the market town was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, overlaps or undercovers from the previous calculation period should also be compensated.
Schmidt justified the serious fee increases by the fact that all three wastewater plants were relatively small facilities with a very small sewage production, which ranged between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.
Due to the low distributional basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the volume of wastewater in all three plants is slightly declining.
Furthermore, in the past calculation period, renovation and repair expenses were incurred to a considerable extent for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced in the Azendorf wastewater plant due to damage.
In the pumping station Welschenkahl, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and after almost 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be dredged, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation option had to be installed in order to be able to comply with the water law requirements in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were subject to the updated care and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which were still well below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011/2012.
Steinhäuser made it clear that in the case of the small waste water production in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance "fully break through".
Schmidt added that the market town had been spared from large maintenance costs for the wastewater plants over the past 20 years.
According to Steinhäuser, the situation for the above-mentioned plants will remain precarious in the long run, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal Waste Water Association cannot be expanded to include these plants because they are deficient facilities.
Bulgaria recorded inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest figure (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when positive 0.2% was recorded.
The annual average inflation of the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was measured by the CPI -0.8 %.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, the following groups of consumer goods increased in prices compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and shoes (2.2%); furniture, household appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, as in the previous month; housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communication; and education.
Snapchat 'anime' effect criticised as Asian cartoon
Snapchat says this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it's insensitive to races.
With its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that already borders on the absurd.
You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be made of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are blunt, quirk-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies a day.
All missteps go public.
Snapchat filters have attracted criticism in the past in which they have been accused of promoting the app Blackface or promoting white skin as an ideal of beauty.
When it suggested a filter to some users this week that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow-faced."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.
The news and outrage were widely circulated on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced it would have disabled the feature.
The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters rather than a caricature of Asians.
But outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter was reminiscent of hurtful clichés.
Others firmly opposed the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos were widely shared, wrote that the filter was "injuring and to say the least unpleasant."
She added that "it was difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the depreciating extreme.
Snapchat isn't the only company that crosses these cultural stumbling wires.
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity and integration struggle, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audiences of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterparts - might rather expect sensitivity.
If one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much harder that such stuff goes unnoticed than it used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account prompted others to do the same.
In an essay for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she believes that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in hiring practices on Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"Either she doesn't have a variety of representations of people with other skin colors in her workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."
Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a human resources manager focused on underrepresented populations and on internal integration efforts.
Zhu, for her part, said she will leave her Snapchat account shut down, adding, "I wonder if they need more users like us to be able to say that's not O.K.."
Military leadership distorts ISIS intelligence, states congressional committee
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called. Drawing Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, a congressional investigative committee reported in a report Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force by the Republican members of the Armed Forces Commission, Intelligence Commission and the Defense Budget Committee, reports great discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how supervisors changed their assessments of American efforts in the fight against Islamic State.
Central Command, Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Newspaper intelligence typically nodded off by high-ranking Centcom commanders regularly painted a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism than actual conditions would have allowed on the ground and were consistently more positive than analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report as saying.
"What happened at the Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, a Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The leadership mistakes in the centcom reach to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report shows detailed constant problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.
While there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their pre-laws to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were significantly more positive than the facts," the report noted.
For example, a Centcom relative publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, a Kansas Republican congressman, said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the tops of Central Command changed intelligence reports to downplay the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans launched the task force after it was leaked to them that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.
The report released on Thursday will still be completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports by the inspector general of the Ministry of Defense are underway.
Democratic members of the intelligence committee released their own findings on Thursday, which were in line with some of the Republican task force's conclusions.
"In 2014 and 2015, the Centcom created an overly limited process for creating intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," the high-ranking Democrat in the committee, a member of the Adam B House of Representatives, gave. Schiff, known in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged morale among analysts and "gave excessively little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats said they had not found any evidence of White House intervention among Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary findings of the congressional investigation were released Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."
Last August, the New York Times reported investigations by the Pentagon's inspector general, which were launched after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon press secretary, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on congressional reports while the inspector general's investigation was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigations have implications for the issue of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of Defense Department members).
However, last year's allegations raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.
Criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes from more than ten years ago, when a centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a document about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, provided only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to worry about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current coverage of the Islamic State.
Last year, the team around Mr. Hooker, according to government agencies, found that, contrary to the government’s statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these had put temporary refineries into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, that finding has not been published, the Times reported in September.
Centcom's commander at the time, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, has been criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was at Central Command through Gen. Joseph L. Votel replaced.
The US wins fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Britain is imminent
A day after scoring three goals during a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the women's American field hockey team in a Thursday match against India that the American women won by 3-0.
Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember ever having done that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who remembers their gates.
However, she knows this: The American women are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are on par in their group with the British women in first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two will gain first and second place within their group of six teams.
The first-place finisher will avoid the strong Dutch women a little longer, who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the American women have sparked a surprising fuss through their success story, four years after landing in the last London Games in the last of 12 places.
Bam was part of that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time at three years old had a hockey stick in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at 16 she became a U.S. national player, the youngest in the team's history.
She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she failed to qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and with that things began to turn to the better.
"A change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said.
We didn't have the workload in London that we have now.
We were able to completely take the helm.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the match with a backhand blow from close range.
India had gone into the match without a win in the tournament, but the team showed surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then pulled into the middle and plucked the ball into the goal to give the American women a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the final quarter.
The shutout was the first of the entire tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who has so far had to score one goal in each of the previous matches.
She's got a run.
Same as Bam.
"We're in a good position," Parnham said, but how good will depend on the outcome of Saturday's next game.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympics, the Zen des trampolines
Wherever you are, however late it is, it is the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel consistent and inevitable, a frenzied relay between competition and pursuits.
It's like the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is served by the crossbow shooter to the swimmer to the gymnast to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen when talking to your neighbor in the queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who is at the Olympics for the first time and a women's crush with dimples, could well have been among those familiar names broadcast to prime time, built up by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in the Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event the same.
Further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally accepted: air gun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.
But if I might modestly make arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it has been so sparsely perceived for the past 16 years that many who, I had questioned, did not know that it is an Olympic sport at all.
That could also be regional ignorance.
Although the U.S. sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and had an athlete by 2012 who made it to the finals.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians those for the women.
Dong Dong of China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
Trampoline jumping has a certain outside charm, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than that for the Olympics.
At this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoonish trembling of his never-to-end impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially unites.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means "springboard."
Emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have to take a series of falling movements (turning, pike and somersaults) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, difficulty and "flight time".
Tirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
Medal hopes must continue in their pursuit of gold, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down the playground.
They not only chase the finish line or the exit wall, but also another sneering goal in the television broadcast: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even bring a spectator to tears.
But it's also what I feel as a bit tiring even when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a respite of this.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is above.
A forward movement is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Again, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no bulge in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.
It's as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
Women's qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; those of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will broadcast the final rounds as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.
In the midst of the Olympic mania, they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult.
If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the gawking and objectification of male athletes - as the male U.S. gymnasts recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base, struggling for air.
"A generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long a U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters calling for political changes in Ethiopia encountered violent government resistance.
Witnesses testify that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with police during gunfire.
Is Ethiopia in the process of collapsing?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country and expanded into more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people stormed into the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government's response was relentless, according to human rights organizations.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed tens of unarmed protesters.
Videos in circulation about the protests, which are believed to be from last or early this year, show security guards hitting young people with sticks while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, told a research group.
Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved dramatically - there is a new commuter train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations have continuously led the oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents effectively silenced.
Many were exiled or sent to prison, killed or driven to the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
"If you oppress people and these have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia.
The entire youth are protesting.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to stranglehold in terms of power of the ruling coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this jagged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turmoil and arm themselves again.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode after years of skinking before the surface.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years have many Ethiopians been able to communicate via social media, as cheaper smartphones became more and more common and Internet services improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said they gathered to protest in this way.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, have prospered in politics and business, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and living in lowland areas.
But even that's changing right now.
"We are in the process of coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The biggest protests took place in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which make up around 6 percent of the population and that are dominant in the military, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the riots is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012.
He was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly savvy at perceiving early signs of discontent and using special representatives to work on opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he doesn't enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.
Many fear the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such a riot was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that were seemingly botched by the government and subsequently stolen, according to analysts.
During the subsequent raids, many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in recent months and that time of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable advances in poverty reduction.
But obviously this has not prevented the intensification of the internal resentment of the Ethiopian government.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked business run by Tigray and hatred of the Tigray is becoming increasingly common on social media.
Analysts say the protests put the U.S. and other Western allies in a peculiar position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," Mr. Abdi said, "is a very thin tightrope."
Donald Trump declares his claim Obama founded ISIS was "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by saying his multiple repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group had not been serious.
This clarification raised new questions about the communication capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also puts his fellow soldiers, who are trying to protect him during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the hint at a campaign event on Wednesday night, Mr. rowed. Trump in reference to Thursday's claim and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. said. Trump, he's just sarcastic.
The tweet was the contrast to the previous day that Mr. Trump in a series of interviews said he meant the accusation completely serious.
As the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help to weaken the statement somewhat by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee didn't want to know about it.
The last storm of criticism is on Mr. Trump down while trying to turn his campaign's focus on the economic situation because of falling poll numbers.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches on the Michigan economic situation this week.
On Friday, Mr. tried. Trump to return to this issue again.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already put forward sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July, he drew strong criticism when he said the Russians should Mrs. Clinton's emails hack, but he later declared "Of course I meant that sarcastically."
This method allows Mr. Trump to push the linguistic boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary, "clarify" depending on how the reaction turns out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump adopted an even more caustic tone as his poll numbers have declined further.
A new survey by NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead with a big lead in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump, in general, is trying not to apologize for his provocative remarks, frequently accusing his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humour.
But while he is increasingly in the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump's jokes put his loyal colleagues in the uncomfortable situation of having to stand by him, regardless of how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent advocates, went to great lengths to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments," Mr. said. Giuliani, therefore, he to the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements were questioned as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely false and because it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the administration under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton served as secretary of state, it allowed ISIS to spread by refraining from aggressively bringing the situation in the Middle East under control.
Ahead of campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of riding around on each of his words and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some of the Democrats were mocking at Mr. Trump's apology as just further proof that he was unsuitable for presidential office.
Once overrupted from the market via price, Café comes back in Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash that did not have a Wi-Fi but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices have been pushed out of his Bedford Avenue storefront.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel exempt and Verb is now a soap business."
But if New York is change, then it's also reinvention.
A revived Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe, which is the owner and managing director of the new cafe.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new field office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
On the menu are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said.
Recently on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, she would take the path.
After the verb closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized it was because of the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked," she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Tom Rosenthal has been another long-time and loyal customer since the verb began in 2003.
He went there before work and inevitably ordered the same thing.
"I came quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch and they're preparing my everything-bagel with butter," he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
These days, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he alternates his everything bag with bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he didn't hold a grudge about the soap business taking the old business space.
In fact, the owners of the soap offered Cherie to make a special soap for verb with the cold-brewed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we're still going to go into their offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he plans to exhibit it soon, making his new neighbors feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice restaurant wants to fill and sell the cold-brewed coffee in the bottle.
There is a chance the cafe will expand to a neighboring building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the cafe closed.
When the new cafe opened, Whitt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee felt like a homecoming.
"I had to smell this," he said.
The depressing food of the economic crisis in "an abundant meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a foodie, President Roosevelt had a penchant for refined dolphins of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.
His menu that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, as dessert, a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added, "It was also a message to the Americans about how they should eat."
The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Coe's last book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in the U.S., while Ziegelman tells in her book "97 Orchard" about living in an apartment building on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, no-frills snack in the Flatiron District that has been in the store since the stock market crash in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, the couple found this appropriate for a discussion of food in the Great Depression era.
"Rich foods were very popular," Ziegelman said.
There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread.
They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve as dinner for them.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the Great Depression, the table was an all-you-can-eat buffet in an American household, especially in rural areas.
Women's crews cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pâtés were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" records the ways the country handled to no longer be the land of slack.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense subject for the Americans," Coe reasoned why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Just as tense was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes such as breads and cash reels became staples, the casserole as a "wonderful way to recycle food scraps," Ziegelman noted, as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a crempy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the focal point of American cuisine, became a rarely served luxury.
Peculiar blends were tried, as a high-calorie and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen mind.
During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
"It wasn't a popular addition at lunchtime," Coe says.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not match.
It was typical of many of the home economics recipes.
As never before or since, household economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - drove the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become "household politicians" and to live up to the challenge of turning pamrache into delicious meals like creamy spaghetti with carrots.
"A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical treats.
In particular, the reports of the government's response to the starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's lass-mich-cake-food attitude, are palatable.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he, like the millionaire man of world he has become, dissed.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully alien to reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, had not asked him to make an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in tastes by Ms. Roosevelt led to the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleak prepared."
Many of the species from the Great Depression era of dealing with food was discarded once the country got back on its feet.
The legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple indicated that they had better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw away food.
"She had a real fear of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates at Eisenberg's had cleared, they and Coe pulled out a dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt ate lunch.
"It's called Prune Whip," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone dived a little reluctantly a spoon into the tough, brown glibber.
Amazingly, it didn't taste bad.
Coe picked up a follow-up three times.
Like a can-do budgetier, he said to his wife, "A few chopped walnuts would help."
Killed in bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He put his own life on the line to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save others' lives.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group that has so far saved almost 60,000 lives, according to Bild-Zeitung.
2900 volunteers put their own lives at risk to pull people out of bombed-out homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: A video of the civil guard showing him from the rubble of a house during an 11-hour rescue of an infant went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol figure in the horror of war.
However, as a hero, he has never seen himself, according to Bild, "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die to save lives, I think God sees me as a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he had spoken in a video about the last bombings in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrel bombs over the Alzadia district, one was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the poisonous remains of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime had been supposed to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation aboard the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims through the North Atlantic at a good 1 km/h - to this day.
Greenland sharks only get offspring at the age of 150.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters.
Only when it comes down to it, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a whopping 2.6 km/h - and is with this top speed half as fast as a seal.
However, this lifestyle, which is marked by slowness, seems to be a recipe for old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case of a Greenland shark, which could be 392 years old.
"Insanity," comments Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this lifespan, which means a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are getting stone-aged.
Only the evidence was missing.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.
Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland sharks.
They measured their slow-motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.
These sharks make prey anyway: In the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
They may be hunting sleeping animals or patrolling the bottom of the ice sea, looking for carcasses that stumble down from higher layers of water.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks that brought fishermen from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic between 2010 and 2013.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest size was 502 centimeters.
To determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the sharks' lens core using the carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens is created even before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are no longer renewed later.
The two smallest sharks had a striking amount of carbon-14 in the lens core.
Their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempts hurled larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third-smallest animal with a length of 220 centimeters, on the other hand, the lens core contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons tests, so it is likely to be its 50 in its investigation in 2012. Birthday have celebrated.
All the larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal amounts of carbon-14 in their lens core, which is created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.
In fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493-centimeter-long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimeters is likely to be even 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters.
Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals was probably on the threshold of sexual maturity at 392 centimeters and his age was determined at 156 years, Greenland sharks obviously take at least one and a half centuries with the proliferation.
This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates at the moment.
The fact that such methusalems live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon a 120-year-old harpoon tip was stuck on the neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a saving flame.
So they mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become particularly large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than with a gram of elephant.
Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal lives more dangerously and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Building plot in a double pack
In the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on topics relating to construction.
With relief, the panel took up Mayor Robert Putz's notice that "finally the marketing of the recently designated residential building land can begin."
After the land, parcelling and development questions could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the land in the residential areas "Straßlweg" and "Schönau-West" (district Binderstraße - extension section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal to young families and sprightly senior citizens alike.
As it was said, construction volunteers can now report to the town hall, the award of the plots is expected to be discussed by the local council in its September meeting.
In order to be able to comply with inquiries about the establishment of further commercial enterprises, combined with the creation of jobs, the local council decided to amend the land use plan, which was only newly drawn up in the spring of this year, in sub-areas.
Thus, in the area of Unterzeitlarn, the already designated industrial area is expanded by two plots in the direction of Staatsstraße 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
"It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit the most from the Brexit vote," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses will be allowed to continue to operate financial transactions from London across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport, the approval in the UK is sufficient for them so far.
This is what major US banks are using.
Several banks have already announced plans to relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
For Frankfurt, according to the IW, the headquarters of the European Central Bank (ECB), the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance regulator EIOPA and the risk council ESRB, said.
Although the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is headquartered in Paris, it is less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"The proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as they can thus communicate directly with the supervisory authority," says IW professor Voigtländer.
Although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, it is performing worse, as does Dublin, in terms of infrastructure.
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
"In Paris, it's not that easy to find free high-quality offices," says Voigtländer.
At the Seine, rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by the management consultancy Mercer, the city was in seventh place, Luxembourg in 19th place, Dublin in 33rd place and Paris at 37. Place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors," concludes the IW.
But despite the Brexit vote, London will remain the most important financial center in Europe, the economic researchers believe.
The balance of power also speaks for this: According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015, compared to 62500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A U.S. magistrate ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of the legal costs incurred by it from the Hepatits C litigation with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from a $200 million compensation payment for the infringement of two patents by Merck, which were related to the blockbuster drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead after a U.S. judge uncovered a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including the perion and other unethical acts.
In filing the lawsuit Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead is entitled to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to equalize with Gilead, which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that over 90 percent of patients with liver disease can cure.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed property on laboratory work that underlying sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
U.S.-backed troops say they have once again reclaimed complete control of Manbij from the Islamic State
U.S.-backed troops have reclaimed full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left it, a spokesman for the group said Friday.
Syria's (DKS) Democratic Forces are currently scouring the city after the exodus of the remaining group of militants buried inside the city.
They have freed over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the DKS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we're doing clean-up work right now," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, which yielded a USD 10.75 million income and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2% for the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband.
In 2015, the Clintons donated USD 1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton generated nearly USD 5.3 million in speech fees; the former secretary of state reported a USD 3 million income from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book on her tenure in the State Department.
Clinton's candidate for the vice presidency, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, along with his wife, Anne Holton, is releasing his tax returns of the past decade.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency," Clinton campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In a stark contrast to this, Donald Trump hides behind false excuses and pullbacks in relation to his previous promises to release his tax returns.
It is common for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal.
"They're on the move," Clinton's campaign aide Ian Sams wrote on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential nominee.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump's special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release anything until the tax audits are complete.
Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have already announced that his refusal raises questions regarding wealth, his donations to charity, his business conduct and various other connections, particularly with Russia.
Clinton has already lashed out on the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday calling on senior Republicans to publish his tax return.
On Thursday, she also raised the issue during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to release his tax returns," she said of the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little tax for two years during the 1990s, and a New York Times business journalist on Friday quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advisors who indicated that could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign event for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called for Trump to exchange for a meeting to file their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the IRS and that Trump was "anxiety" to voters rather than tax authorities.
Clinton's campaign has released tax returns declining by 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid, on average, an effective federal tax rate of approx. 32% between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx. 40.5%.
The Clintons' 2015 tax return showed that these only received USD 100 of their income as a wage, unlike the bulk of all Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chilli powder, firecrackers promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox species to stop elephants from going into man-made settlements - they throw condoms at them that are filled with chilli powder.
The method has proven to be effective and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. conservation by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and crops without injuring animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we have been... Toolkit developed, we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities, whereby they are much more confident that they can deter the elephants from their fields without harming the elephant in the process," the managing director of Honeyguide Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps include illuminating the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is packed together with a firecracker into a condom, the end of which is turned to the ignition cord.
When it is lit, the condom bursts open with a bang and sprays fine dust on chilli powder into the air.
A touch quite usually already to chase away the elephant.
A final possibility is a launcher that shoots a gold rain fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
City Council unanimously decides: No new kiosk building on St. Goarer Rheinufer
Usually take the St. Goar investment projects by traders with a kissing hand - especially the retail trade in the core city is considered to be significantly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the application for the new construction of a sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"In principle, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine, this kiosk does not fit," explained Michael Hubrath for the CDU Group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli primary is removed after "Arab" prompt - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media riot after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed an Israeli primary, as it would have "requested" Arab guests, according to a staff member.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," let out his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country code list.
However, the country was not listed between the countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and deleted?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel through its own call center.
Searching for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The response he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said the measure was a "deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski Hotels."
The reason behind it sparked even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the area code be deleted," the employee was quoted by Lanzmann as saying.
Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called this a "great shame," the Süddeutsche Zeitung reports.
We were horrified and dismayed by this event.
That's really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a greater shame.
That doesn't require any explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," the official said.
The incident sparked a pretty big response on the Internet, where people called the whole thing a scandal.
Some insinuated to the Kempinski Hotel that it had "given in" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you," it said in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is located near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all allegations and called the incident an "accident" and "apologised" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was never a direct instruction" not to include Israel in the speeding dial list," the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to demonstrate against the government's reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The difficulties began when police officers tried to drive the students apart, causing police to deploy rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students attended the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the governor of the state of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, a little less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protest participants saw graffiti spraying against the provisional President Michel Temer on walls.
The latest protests occurred a few days after protesters took to the streets in crowds to support suspended President Dilma Rousseff, who had been removed from office by a Senate vote to be relegated.
Russia & Iran trade suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9 percent year-on-year.
Since international sanctions against Iran were lifted, interest on the part of Russian companies in business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are making existing ties with Iran, while new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 70.9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran skyrocketed by 91.5 percent, amounting to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade upturn has been achieved through supplies of machinery, land vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
Furthermore, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
You could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia from last year, will be broken," he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market in Waldbröl raided
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening at the beverage market of Rewe XXL on the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
With a firearm, three darkly dressed people who had hooded their faces demanded the surrender of cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver-colored VW Golf.
How much money was captured, the police do not inform.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is accessible and difficult to see directly from the parking deck of the Rewe market.
The perpetrators must have run after the raid in the direction of Gerberstraße, Friedrich-Engelbert-Weg and fled from the gravel parking lot opposite the parking garage entrance with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who made observations at the time of the crime (at about 19:45) that are in connection with the robbery should urgently report to the police.
Nagold: Play and fun at summer leisure
The children and young people of the social education day group/social group work of the children’s protection association Nagold spent eight beautiful and happy days with their carers on their summer leisure in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
The lively group was accommodated in the quietly located leisure home Hardtwäldle during the first week of the school holiday.
Several full-day excursions were on the program.
For one thing, we went to Bretten with a visit to the petting zoo.
On the other hand, to Maulbronn, where there was a special children's tour in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
At the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf, the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days, the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash.
Culinary children and caregivers were spoiled with their self-prepared favorite dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser-Bloff, the English Breakfast and Tübingen Bolognese.
In workshops, a battic, beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones were created or a Roman mill game was made of wood.
Other highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Colourful Evening."
On the day of the journey home, the sun laughed and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrims to the Gate of Mercy
The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna was on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage of all ministers in probably two years, the Upper Ministerial Round St. Anna determined to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and they finally decided on the episcopal city of Freiburg, where this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the gate of mercy open at the Freiburg Cathedral a special pilgrimage destination was offered.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The night before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna off, blessed the pilgrims' crosses and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb was driven by train to the starting point Villingen, where a cathedral of Our Lady also stands and so the pilgrimage route from the Münster was started.
The individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and writings.
But also on the way, the minis made a break at field crosses, chapels or churches again and again to sing a song together from specially compiled pilgrim song booklet.
For the overnight stays, parish homes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
On the second day we went via Furtwangen to Gütenbach.
The next day the stage was taken to St. Peter an, who was the most difficult route, had to be descended in sultry heat first about 500 meters and then climbed again.
The deserved reward in the evening was a joint barbecue at the Badweiher.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter went to Freiburg on the final stage.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburger Münster in the later afternoon and crossed the gate of mercy.
With a little impulse, God was thanked here.
In the evening mass in the Münster, the minis arrived at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by cooperator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day there was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
In the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scotsman Callum Skinner storms home as Brit won gold for cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to glory last night in the men's team sprint at the velodrome in Rio when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. The youngster made the legend proud when he stormed home to earn a win from favourites New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy picked up the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after picking up only a modest sixth place at the World Track Championships in London in March despite Hoys's resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes appeared.
Hoy's retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scotsman that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders prevailed in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
Hindes was narrowly behind after his round, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.
A change of strategy accounted for a large part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep up the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as a BBC expert and stood out to Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as these climbed onto the podium.
The 23-year-old skinner from Glasgow said: "It's a flattering comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the finals and defeated the world champions.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win this.
After the 2012 triumph alongside Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew that statement and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
Hindes said: "It feels like London with all the GB flags in the stands."
We've come together as a team over the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
That's an event, a gold medal for the nation won seven of 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If that's a barometer of our progress over the last five months, that's what we expect to see successfully five days in the velodrome.
With Form Kennys, it's in the realm of possibility that he repeats Hoy's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
That would be for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who is also on 23. March was born (an apparently sacred date for British sport; on that day, Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal mean.
That would be the same as Hoy.
Kenny next takes part in the sprint, which begins today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I enjoy this just for the moment."
The team event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a little lonely to win alone.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-man-kilometer race.
They arrived at the finish in 3:51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3:51.659.
The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, in which Wiggins will certainly be in focus.
He had argued with commissioners yesterday before the qualification when officials called him to himself to measure his height.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4:13.260.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympics and pick up a share of medals.
After a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were shut down.
Dramas played out in the background, according to the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April amid sexism and bullying allegations, as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.
Future of Portland smeltering due to repeal of energy contract questionable
The future of Portland's aluminum meltdown in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers' jobs - are at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus cancel all supply contracts, the supplying energy company said.
This move followed the government's decision in Victoria earlier this year not to award any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A subsidy set for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs at Alcoa's Portland facility are at stake.
No fewer than 2000 jobs -- direct as well as indirect -- could be at risk in the event of closure.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria's total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's smelter in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the price of electricity for the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects three more owners to cancel their contracts.
The facility is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity through the smelter," the company said in a statement.
AGL continued to testify that the contracts were so-called "security transactions" that should have come into effect from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"Therefore, AGL expects that the contracts will contribute to revenues in fiscal year 17," the electricity supplier said.
All potential impact on revenues on AGL from the GJ 18 onwards is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already written off the value of the contracts in its annual financial statements amounting to $187 million in "expectation of a termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts did not affect the "ability of Alcoa... to operate the smelter or to ensure the power supply to the smelter."
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 that should have gone into effect from November this year, even if it still owes a statement as to why it resigned from the contract.
Analysts warn of the possible closure of the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle due to the poor economic conditions of the industry.
Referring to the analysts' statements earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland consumes around 600 megawatts of electricity annually and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity.
Should both plants disappear from the market, it would mean a significant reduction in demand in the [electricity market].
And for us as an electricity producer, that wouldn't be good," he said.
More than just a Kardashian reality TV star, Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of US Vogue.
Kendall, who is Estee Lauder's brand ambassador and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), scripted reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn, as well as in the presence of the all-round most popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest) how they all have planned to forget their sister's cover and that ends with a classic twist:
That represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacrest brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?" with the honesty of a cartoon rabbit on a broadcasting place at 8 a.m.), but Kris somehow had to let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With regard to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of the Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall's big sister Kim may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on display in April 2014), but the cover of the magazine's September issue is a league in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's most sold edition of the year.
With a volume that resembles a picture book rather than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, from the 832 pages of the Wälzer, 615 pages of advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, pictures of the magazine leaked even before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, clearly more "celebrities modeling" than "models who are celebrities" have been on the cover.
Oscar-winning actress and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the slight chance that Ms Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she finds herself in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if it all applies to Jenner).
They are truly talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.
Of course, Jenner's success doesn't please everyone.
With her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the fashion world has always been a bit tense.
In June, one-time Victoria's Secret model criticized Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling her "the bitches of the moment."
Those feelings boiled over again when the news came out with Jenner's appearance on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on the displeasure seems to be passing the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of Vogue.
She is literally a supermodel.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She advertises your primer by Estee Lauder.
You and all your sisters are selling you pictures of yourself on their respective paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, she can be seen on reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country's aid needs are turned away annually by the community law centres, while the industry is preparing for the impact of further funding cuts on already overburdened transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, workers in need of help, victims of violence and those who have no funds for unjust delogations and the like - are already dismissed in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already unduly utilised, are getting ready for further cuts.
From June next year, it is envisaged that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds.
The director of the municipal law centers of Queesland James Farrell said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Rights Centers revealed that thousands of people are already turned away every year.
Farrell said the situation would only get worse without a repeal of the federal government's decision.
"Queensland's community law centers are chronically underfunded, which means thousands of people are turned away by important services you need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through breakups, workers who have been unjustly laid off - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this elevation shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning that thousands of people in need from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help.
We call on the Attorney General and Federal Justice Minister, as well as senators of Queensland George Brandis, to immediately lift these funding cuts so that people can receive the help they need in the event of legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its pledge to raise funds for legal aid to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of the community law centres and their customer communities, as well as that the Palaszczuk government is investing in this important work.
Donald Trump campaign charged after staff allegedly drew gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after being told that her campaign manager for North Carolina was targeting a firearm at a staffer in February while traveling in a Jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed Wednesday in Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini said he had waited for months that the matter would be settled internally before he realised that "this would not happen."
The campaign manager, Earl Philip, "drew a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's knee," Bordini indicated in his indictment.
After complaining to local and regional campaign management, Bordini found that at least four other people had already had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't need to be fired to do damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a riot when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the "Second Amendment People" - firearms owners and gun friends - should take action should his rival Hillary Clinton be elected and appoint judges.
Trump's campaign clarified that the media had taken his words out of context and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini's complaint seeks damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and Philip for assault and permanent mental damage.
Trump's press secretary, Hope Hicks, could not be reached for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign's staff.
Calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, were not responded to.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far run a controversial campaign.
The procedure is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, Supreme Court, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin/Schwerin: Poll before state elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (4. September) and Berlin (18. September) significant losses are looming for the ruling parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys by the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-black ruling coalition in the north could narrowly continue to govern, this is not possible according to the poll numbers in Berlin.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would therefore have a good chance of continuing to face the head of government.
In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD crashed to 24 percent from 35.6 percent five years ago.
According to the poll, the party would only be slightly ahead of the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.
Third place is controversial between the left and the AfD.
The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented in the state parliament with 19 percent for the first time.
The Greens moved back into the Schwerin state parliament despite slight losses with 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
In the Berlin parliamentary election, the SPD would only come to 23 percent according to the poll (election 2011: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached just 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, the pirates, on the other hand, would miss the entry in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
Email and the Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand.
On the contrary, it was pretty clunky.
The built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two high-resolution selfies today.
An iPhone is now available at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came exactly 20 years ago, on the 15th. August 1996, to the shops - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros, lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet Age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an "office in vest pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could do a lot for standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also by fax the Communicator could be reached.
Even access to websites was possible via HTML browser, albeit excruciatingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the phone could be folded up similarly to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.
The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 euros.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.
No one could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would become the start of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled.
The market today is dominated by providers, all of whom came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is commonplace for a lot of people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, Samsung and Apple alone accounted for 555 million units.
Global sales of the devices are around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the well-run business of the countless app providers and the telecommunications companies.
Around the smartphone, an entire industry has now emerged.
The decisive breakthrough to the mass market came only in early 2007, when Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone at Mac-World.
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a phone and an Internet communicator, everything via touch screen easy to use.
Apple's triumphal march began, even today the iPhone is the company's most important product.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, who dominated the market, were left behind.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry struggled.
Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung are now in charge.
The smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention.
On average, every German now looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put the smartphone away," said Janina Kugel, who is responsible for personnel on the Siemens board.
Permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time.
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local municipalities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this represented the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as it did in London in 2012, when we put a lot of effort into ensuring that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And that will be achieved again by creating new opportunities for locals and companies near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will already create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead to us in London 2012, there will be those who will think the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great.
I've been told that England will never be ready for the games and that we're going to embarrass ourselves on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers every question he has asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many rather than individuals.
Expansion is one way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth, and leave a legacy of skills and employment around both the airport and the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has implemented a £11bn infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was voted the world's best airport terminal for five consecutive years, to the T2 built amid the world's two most frequented catwalks.
Now they stand ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is backed by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games have been a huge success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.
It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, while securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "cat and mouse game" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to bypass ad blocking are equivalent to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus published a blog post telling it that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop page would change the encoding regarding its ads to make it difficult to detect ad blockages about which part of the advertising page is.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock's spokesman, Ben Williams, wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the display-blocking open source community and the circumventors has been going on since the invention of display blockers," and that it's possible that Facebook will come up with a new solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worrying display blockers have become for the industry.
Globally, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people use display blockers; nearly four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile phone advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook's mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a large enough share of revenue, so Facebook seems to be worthwhile to invest such a step.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to have people more control over advertising targeted.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that adblock's new filters would be worrying because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
"For users, this does not represent a positive experience, so we plan to address the issue," a Facebook spokesperson said in an email statement.
Ad blockers are a blunt remedy, which is why we have instead focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Woman run over in suspected suicide on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was run over in the early hours of Thursday in a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway.
The incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay down on the road in the dark "in an act of despair" and were hit by several cars, police in Vaud testified.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was run over by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but some have still not been identified, said the police, who ask them, as well as any witnesses to the incident, to come forward.
An investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed.
Was a collision avoidable?
That's something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers are not held accountable.
In each of the two cases - in which one person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that motorists do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a female policewoman was acquitted of negligent homicide after she ran over and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and has fallen unconscious in the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner and that the presence of a man in the street was a "perfectly extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information on Thursday's incident near Morges should contact police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
Venus was probably once habitable, according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to discover Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-density atmosphere, might once have Earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow revolution of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and yet continue to turn slowly.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to house lives and protect against rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent matter.
"In the GISS model simulation, the slow turn of Venus exposes its day side to the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures, which are a few degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model spawned a history of Venus that resembles evolution previously suspected by planetary scientists.
Although it was once presumably habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billion years -- was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away by the ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained -- the Venus, who know it like we do today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche's coach
Patrick Roy resigned as Colorado Avalanche's coach and vice president of hockey operations on Thursday, leading too little co-determination in the team's decision-making process.
Alternative President/General Manager of the Colorados Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
"Over the past three years, I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations of the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I've been thinking long and a lot over the course of the summer about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, this one needs it and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have a right of participation in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
These conditions are not currently being met.
Sakic, the Roy on 23. May 2013 had been hired, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me about that decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future.
Roy was named the league's best coach during his debut season at the 2013-14 Avalanches as the winner of the Jack Adams Award.
He led the club to 112 points and to first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was beaten in the first round of Minnesota playoffs and missed the post-season in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches recorded a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-16 season, falling behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference by five points.
As Hall of Fame goalkeeper, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
The labor disputes regarding remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended, while all parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group, as well as the Unite and RMT unions, can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute," a joint statement said.
We will hold some full-day sessions over the next few weeks, which will start early next year to re-tack the issues.
The unions said their last strike, which is the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year cut rates to its contrakers in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures.
The company's rate cut follows a 10 percent drop for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts give the company the space it needs to get through the market downturn.
Shell has laid off thousands of people for its portion and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations as a result of its mega-merger with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that had intensified by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes that have been happening in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for the few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected compared to an average of around $7 billion in the last five years.
Kepler measures rotation rate of stars in the pillar of the Pleiades
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the Pleiades' star cluster.
The new data help astronomers to understand why stars rotate in the star cluster at different rates and in what connection the rotation periods with the planet formation are.
"We hope that by comparing our results to other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster of stars, which formed around 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.
They are now spinning the fastest.
These ripening stars emit large amounts of stellar winds at peak rotation rates.
Since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars rotate more slowly than fewer massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars spinning more slowly pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the "ballet" of the Pleiades, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as the ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The Pleiads' star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot ahead of us about which we would like to learn more about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and, so to speak, hang their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported in detail in three newspaper reports on their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Pleiades, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball star steps down
Tears were running faster at Alex Rodriguez than the US baseball star in best days from base to base.
After his emotional resignation announcement, the 41-year-old professional will turn 12 on the 12th. August against the Tampa Bay Rays wear the jersey of his New York Yankees one last time.
“I love this game and this team.”
"I say 'Goodbye' to both," the 14-time Major League Baseball (MLB) all-star game participant explained.
Rodriguez was voted the league's most valuable player three times, and won the World Series with the Yankees in 2009.
His signature under a ten-year contract gave him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31. In December 2017, he will act as a consultant and youth coach - with a full salary.
As a player, it paid Rodriguez back with performance for a long time.
With 696 home runs, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees, he managed some milestones.
With Hall-of-Fame members Hank Aaron and Willie Mays, only two other baseball players have similar scores in the key statistics.
But the 41-year-old should not be accepted into the hall of fame of baseball.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A-Rod" - was on the field, so controversial is his appearance off the pitch.
As early as 2009, the superstar admitted on "ESPN" to having consumed banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013, he was banned for 211 matches until the end of 2014 due to a involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the prime suspect of having received performance-enhancing funds for years through an anti-aging clinic in South Florida.
After a legal dispute, the ban was still reduced to 162 encounters.
"The league might even have done me a favor for 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break," Rodriguez said smugly at the time.
Even his farewell days are not silent.
While many baseball legends once again get the big stage in their final games, Rodriguez frequently had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't involve a farewell tour."
"My job involves trying to win every game," etched Yankees coach Joe Girardi.
After all, Rodriguez, who was married to actress Cameron Diaz and is said to have the circumstances with pop star Madonna and actress Kate Hudson, received sympathy from the fans of the Yankee archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want A-Rod," the supporters sang in the 4:9 defeat to the Rodriguez team.
Olympics 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland in Rio is not allowed to start.
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympics are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
A caught athlete almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of the competition, the first official doping cases became known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000-metre obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa of Bulgaria and Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski tested positive in Brazil and were ruled out - immediately before the start of the already critically eyed athletics competitions, this news comes at untimely.
Chen had already been diagnosed with the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide last Sunday, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances.
The International Court of Sport CAS confirmed its exclusion from the Olympics on Friday afternoon local time.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had finished fourth in the final over 100 m butterfly, only by 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have taken part in the preliminary rounds over 50 m freestyle.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the B sample and a hearing.
The national association "takes the matter very seriously and requires Chen to cooperate fully in the investigations," Xinhua said in a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sport CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, the IOC is no longer responsible for the sanctioning of the athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio, the news about the positive rehearsal at Danekowa leaked, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
"I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," this was "an incredible shock," she told Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," the athlete explained.
According to the report, the banned substance is said to be the blood doping agent EPO.
Danekova has been provisionally suspended, according to BNT, the B sample is also said to have already turned out positive.
Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borissov immediately spoke out with criticism of the athlete.
"I don't understand why the athletes don't draw the right conclusions," he said, "We Bulgarians are under observation, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doping-contractive nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" was also announced, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, like his brother Tomasz, tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone three days earlier.
Both deny the intake, but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekowa case in particular is another serious blow for the reputation of the entire sport.
The world governing body IAAF had banned the entire Russian team from starting with one exception because of systematic doping, and the runner nation Kenya also produced numerous bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the previous offenses in China had also caused fierce clashes between the athletes.
So the Frenchman Camille Lacourt harshly attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also the focus of an altercation with Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," he said.
Sun had tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to serve a three-month lockdown.
Data theft: So perfidious hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.
According to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, the United Kingdom and Germany, 40 percent of the companies surveyed have been victims of an attack with blackmail software at least once in the past twelve months, some of them several times.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already once the target of ransomware blackmail.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransoms demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators are specializing their blackmail software, according to the observations of malware bytes, on attacks in corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extortionable ransom is significantly higher than for private users.
"We are currently observing a frighteningly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with Welt.
In 2008, most malware programs were still designed to send out advertising.
Then the perpetrators discovered extortion software for themselves.
First, private users were the target, but the switch to company attacks took place in recent months frighteningly fast.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim's computer, she specifically searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.
These files encrypt the ransomware and delete the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the requirements of the blackmailers.
In order to get the end key code to the files, the victims have to transfer money - usually in the form of the crypto currency Bitcoin.
But where the personal photo database is at stake for private users, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production is at a standstill.
Accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported loss of revenue due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt the business activity, in one case people were in danger of life.
In Germany, hospitals have been victims of attacks several times, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always tell the victims: Do not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski.
Yet 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetrators in view of a standstill in the company.
The hackers, in turn, know this and are trying everything to build a good reputation.
In a recent study, F-Secure’s security researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service to take more money.
They explain to their victims via chat how they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-figure sums to get their data back unencrypted.
Given the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from ransomware blackmail, the hackers are becoming more and more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of antivirus provider Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware about a week."
However, it is more likely that it is three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.
"The scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for more hackers to spread the freshly purchased software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
So you log into one of the forums underground, buy the set from a criminal and instruct another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
"Usually, the criminals then commission spammers to spread," Wisniewski explains.
The risk of ransomware is now known to many companies that better back up their data.
More than 50 percent of the company IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust to be able to defend ransomware using file back-ups and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful shooting, the perpetrators threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes CEO Marcin Kleczynski.
Thus, the potential for damage is still many times higher than before, depending on the nature of the data.
In the future, the perpetrators could also target completely new goals in the Internet of Things.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom to many victims.
If the perpetrators then block an entire production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future, ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One in all cases
HONDA HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
In the small HR-V Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds pretty cluttered, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the HR-V, which is only 1.60 m high, looks rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well-made and look pleasant, only the cockpit top drops off.
The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles when it comes to storage space.
Not only is a trunk of 453 l available at high and 1026 l when the backrests are folded over, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: The seats of the rear seat can be folded up like cinema chairs, thus providing storage space that is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.
The trunk can be loaded, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6-l diesel with 88 kW/120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in long speed ranges.
However, he should do his work a little quieter.
The everyday consumption of 4.7 l/100 km is pleasing.
There is another engine: a 1.5-l petrol engine with 96 kW/130 hp.
A four-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
The steering should be a little more direct.
The equipment leaves nothing to be desired in the tested top variant "Executive".
Safety systems include the City Emergency Brake Assist (works up to tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.
The collision warning sometimes irritates because it rates many obstacles as "approaching objects" when maneuvering.
The high-beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign recognition and throttles speed if necessary.
However, the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore a bit cumbersome to reach.
The approximately 29000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.
If you do not want to invest so much, you will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23000 euros.
The engines meet the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR-V, Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline not liable: Fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge.
Because liability is only conceivable in the case of dangers that are typical for air traffic, argued the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124/14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
However, the accident could have happened anywhere - it was a general risk of life, according to the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any damages.
Case of illness: When does the organizer pay
Accidental holidaymakers will only get money back after their trip if the cause of the illness can undoubtedly be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to be showing the same symptoms.
In the case under negotiation, a family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Her illness led the holidaymakers back to a defective sewage treatment plant that had allegedly polluted the seawater.
The family was of the opinion that the trip was thus deficient - and complained against the organizer.
In court, the plaintiffs had no success.
The sewage treatment plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned about it shortly before the plaintiffs left.
He had to assume by then that the seawater was fine.
He did not violate his information obligations, according to the verdict.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly due to contagion with each other - is part of the general risk of life.
Of 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were worried about further attacks.
The state must respond calmly and decisively to terror threats at the same time.
What is certain is that our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not give this triumph to the terrorists.
If criminals had to leave the country more quickly, however, this would increase security and also strengthen the consent of the population for the refugee policy.
De Maizière wants to achieve an implementation of the proposals by the 2017 federal election.
He also announced a further personnel reinforcement of the security forces, "in the middle four-figure scale over several years."
Sympathy advertising for terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance is to be improved, the gun law is to be amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult.
The recently much-discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be safeguarded, according to de Maizière's words.
However, in dialogue with the medical profession, he wants to look for solutions on how to reduce the endangerment of the citizens, he said with regard to mental abnormalities.
In order to counteract the radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers better social care necessary.
Teachers should be better prepared for dealing with traumatized people.
To prosecute criminals in special areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to deploy undercover investigators.
SPD leader Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps to further increase security."
It is important that the Minister of the Interior has clearly spoken out against actionism.
"This was a slap in the face for the sharpeners in the CDU/CSU," Gabriel told the newspapers of the Funke Mediengruppe (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
A general prohibition on full veiling is constitutionally problematic.
You can't ban everything you refuse, and I reject wearing the burqa.
You can talk about rules, for example in road traffic or for witnesses in court.
Greens leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate energy and capacity for action with ever new anti-terrorism packages.
Left Party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet sayings and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people of this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
It regularly jams on the bypass - here's a picture from November.
But that is to change: The right-turn lane is to be extended.
This is good news for all motorists who are stuck in traffic every night when they travel via the motorway shuttle (A 43) in professional traffic on the surrounding road.
The state company road construction will extend next Tuesday and Wednesday (16./17. August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the exit Weseler Straße the right-turn lane around 700 meters.
Drivers can then thread right directly from Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: traffic divides up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the busy section of federal highway 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU faction in the district representation Münster-West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder annoys motorists especially between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.
On weekdays, the backwater reaches to the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
The reason is the eye of the needle on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler Straße.
From here, traffic is only steered in one lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled a good three-quarters of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the required load capacity to accommodate, above all, heavy-duty traffic in two lanes.
The responsible state company cannot say how long this bottleneck and the associated weekday traffic jam will last.
However, years are to be expected: because the bridge has an official residual useful period until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right-turn lane, the state company has deliberately selected the weaker time in the school holidays, because with disabilities is to be expected.
Traffic will be routed one-lane past the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Intercultural trip: cultural offers for schools
The international class of the forest school visited the play "The Invisible House".
The association Nima's and the Junges Theater are now planning a music project.
The association Nima's enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Class International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus has attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das invisiblee Haus" of the Junges Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the association Nima's, 19 students between the ages of eleven and 15 visited the production in the Kleines Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Most of the young people in the class came to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 from Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria, among others, and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were still able to follow the course of the story, according to the press release of the Junges Theater Münster.
The association Nima's, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Junges Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a musical theatre project.
From October to December, young people with and without a refugee and migrant background between the ages of 14 and 20 will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing, dancing, acting and music.
Offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language teaching are planned.
The "Intercultural Journey" project continues.
In view of the increased number of refugees, the association expects many classes that want to participate.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for weather improvement
The weather has given the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope.
The night was badly suited to observe the sky spectacle because of clouds and rain, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory, Hans-Ulrich Keller, on Friday morning.
Our hope is on the night of Saturday.
The weather should be good, then we will see a lot of shooting stars in the sky.
The star scales are Perseids, which are among the fastest shooting stars at 216000 kilometers per hour.
They have their name because they seem to come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Relaxing Night: Tips for Sleep Disorders
In the evening you wall around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep far before the alarm clock ringing.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent perceive their sleep frequently or permanently as unrestful.
How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, a board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
What is commonly understood by this, however, is insomnia, i.e. a sleep-in and through-sleep disorder.
Especially sleeping through, many people find it unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German GPs Association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
Behind it can be organic, psychological or behavioral factors, but also drugs.
Not infrequently, the sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.
"Very early waking up is common, especially in the case of depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors depend on each other.
For example, if you have a herniated disc, you can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly start to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should you go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Those who do not sleep well for a period of one month in at least three nights a week and are impaired in the day should go to the doctor, Weeß advises.
The impairment can look very different: you are knocked off, tired, unsleeped, have difficulties with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headaches.
To relieve the sleep disorder, it is important to find out their causes.
Treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or medications - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.
There are hardly any resident sleep doctors in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin.
Therefore, you should first contact the family doctor in case of sleep problems, advises Weeß.
He can clarify with examinations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?
For examination in the sleep laboratory, doctors advise, for example, in snoring with respiratory lapses, in the case of morbid daytime fatigue, in sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep-through disorder, explains Fietze.
You don’t have to prepare for the investigation.
You should spend the day normally.
"Just please don't take a nap," Fietze says.
After wiring, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nose glasses, a chest strap and a feeler on the finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeper.
How can those affected get to grips with the problems?
There are quite a few adjustment screws to put to for a better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleep and stand-up times, do not lie in bed for too long, do not sleep during the day, do not watch TV, avoid alcohol and do not look at the clock at night - then you start to calculate immediately, and this is not at all conducive.
What to have the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler has commented via Facebook on the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he had won gold for the first time at the World Short Course Championships in Doha and set his first world record at the same time.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has put himself via Facebook protective in front of his criticized ex-teammates.
"In a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000€ premium and a jungle king 150,000€ no one should be surprised about missing medals," the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on the night of Friday.
The support system in swimming is bad, but the doping controls are very good.
This does not allow us to compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look or even do it closely when it comes to doping.
"I'm not saying that the checks are to be stopped here," he further explained.
If he wanted to start a comeback, Deibler would have to be reported to the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA) nine months before his first launch.
This is exactly how you should keep it with countries.
"If you cannot be controlled by independent inspectors of WADA/FINA for a certain time before the World Cup/OS, you must not participate," demands the electoral Hamburger, who now runs an ice cream parlor.
Airport: Gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civil investigators from the Düsseldorf police succeeded on Thursday in the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61.
The suspects had committed several bag and luggage thefts as a gang.
At about 21:30, civilian officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that was known to the policemen from past theft offenses.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July this year and had taken a joint, labour-sharing and particularly professional approach.
The specialists of the Crime Commission 34 can prove four acts to the thieves, who had entered Germany specifically to commit crimes.
They had captured a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between still a residual cobblestones: The Rigaer Straße in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not look like this at first glance, but the police count it among the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a health food shop.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the facade of a gray house.
Opposite a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, is already being built: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls it, are preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.
In particular, the Berlin interior senator Henkel had repeatedly advocated a crackdown by the police against the project since the beginning of the year, calling the area a "no-go zone" for police officers and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.
After on the 22. June the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers had been vacated, police patrolled for three weeks, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site, closed parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94.
Meanwhile, construction workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On the 13. July, a Berlin administrative court ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers withdrew under the cheers of sympathizers and local residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk to the Späti.
In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left-wing violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana*, who raises three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
With the residents of the house projects, they share the concern about rising rents and gentrification.
It doesn't sound like a neighborhood that majority wanted police protection from vandal leftists.
The ditch that the Berlin interior senator and the police open between squatters and their neighbors apparently does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which still has a low average income and high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
Occupations and the resulting housing projects have also been part of the neighbourhood for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße very close to the Rigas.
While the Mainzers had been cleared in a real street battle under a large police force, many of the projects in the Riga were legalized and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berlin voters from all over the world in recent years: residents from GDR times and former squatters now share their neighbourhood with them.
This is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent for new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be recognized by thrown-in windows or freshly painted facades, which were pelted with paint bags.
No other street has been mentioned so often this year along with the words "left-autonomous violence."
One reason why not all neighbors see this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are almost exclusively directed against police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to hit the new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty.
As for acts of violence, she is appeasing: The people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not.
Even the famous burning cars have not existed directly in the Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than elsewhere".
Neugebauer deliberately moved into Rigaer Straße - and remained.
That is why it was so important to her that the local residents get their street back: from the police, the politics and the media, who in July all suddenly claimed the sovereignty of interpretation over the district.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road is still taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former construction gaps, which displace the old inhabitants.
"After all, these are condos that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well-heeled live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what should you do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
For immigrants who are angry about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: The house projects and the left-wing scene belonged to the neighborhood.
Those who move here should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub district, can complain badly about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.
She is also a social worker on site.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social educator supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, working group refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.
Regine Kunde from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the egg-laying woolly milk sow, which has a problem above all.
For example, some - less mocking than aimed at the multitude of desired areas of responsibility - had meant when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
An administrative specialist was sought with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an egg-laying woolly milk sow.
But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.
Above all, it is about organization, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been around for about six weeks.
It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supports honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.
New containers will soon be in Wasenstraße
A serious problem for some time has been finding housing for the follow-up refugees who have been recognized.
The municipalities are responsible for the subsequent accommodation.
You have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces.
The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility changes from the district office to the municipality and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
In fact, the administration does not find private housing.
It does not work so far, but one is dependent on private apartments, according to Deuschle.
Therefore, communal dwellings must be upgraded, as it is called so beautifully.
So new containers will soon be set up in Wasenstraße.
But only with housing it is not done.
Perspective is the keyword, Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree.
In addition to a permanent residence, it is internships, apprenticeships, school places, one-euro jobs and temporary activities for refugees and migrants that must be found or set up.
"More places would be good," reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the construction yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and this motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.
She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external impact.
This is "not occupational therapy."
But activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People should develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here, too, administration and volunteers jump in.
It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the procedures is a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time meaningfully, for example with language courses.
Anyone who eventually develops the feeling that he cannot help anyone in Urbach, must not work and is useless, will never integrate.
The clear majority is motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says Kunde honestly, "people who don't do anything at all". The work of Deuschle and the customer is therefore always to motivate others.
All this is already a "mammoth task."
A difficult question: After the recent incidents, are the two afraid of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No," says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive." However, she cannot and does not want to rule out a residual risk.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents are also an issue for refugees.
They would be afraid that the assassins would bring them completely into disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So full-time and volunteers on the ground and in the region must look for activities.
They always have in the background that a new push of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need a ceiling?
To answer this question clearly, politics is resentful.
Actually, it's unfair to put them on the ground.
"In Urbach, we have not yet arrived where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would relax the situation.
Regine Kunde also makes it clear that the Urbachers are already busy integrating the previous people sensibly.
That's about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, they have to be helped, both women agree.
The political world situation is so complicated, there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglars wanted by helicopter
The police helicopter flew off various areas for about an hour - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcibly entered an apartment in an apartment building in the Lindenweg at around 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The resident surprised the two and slammed the fools into the run.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 metres tall, arguably masked, wearing both blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled to the city centre.
For the search, the police used several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter.
The search was unsuccessful.
Perhaps the unknowns noticed before the fact near the apartment or during their escape.
Baden-Württemberg: Police investigate after rocker attack on snack bar
After an attack on an Ulm snack bar, the police are investigating six suspects from the rocker milieu for serious land breach.
During apartment searches, evidence and drugs were secured, the police said on Friday.

After that, they allegedly attacked two guests and slightly injured one.
After that, they fled.
Damage to the snack bar and the adjacent building amounted to 10000 euros.
According to the investigators, it is a dispute in the Ulm rocker milieu between a Kurdish and a Turkish gang.
