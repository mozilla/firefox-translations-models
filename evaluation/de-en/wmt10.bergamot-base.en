Barack Obama becomes fourth U.S. president to receive Nobel Peace Prize
U.S. President Barack Obama is coming to Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth US president in history.
In addition, he receives the diploma, the medal and a cheque for 1.4 million. Dollars for his extraordinary aspirations to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The White House chief arrives in the northbound metropolis tomorrow with his wife Michelle and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members, who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then scheduled a meeting with the Norwegian king Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its climax with the ceremony at which Obama takes over the prestigious prize.
He will receive this as the fourth US President, but only as the third, who accepts the prize directly in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the Afghanistan war when taking over the prize.
The president does not want to dodge this issue because he knows that he is taking over the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Gol Medal, Diploma and Cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (approx. 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but he has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event programme will then include a banquet with the president and his wife, where, in addition to Norway's king and queen, the Prime Minister and another 250 invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious from the beginning on the price.
He said, for example, that he felt he didn’t quite deserve the prize.
Several times he also repeated that it is the price not only for him, but for all those who strive for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he listed that this is "call to action" for him.
Conservationist is accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases, he lodged appeals against some construction proceedings in the last year, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from the investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz conservation community is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he is in custody and he faces a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting waste containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorting garbage containers again at every turn.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I don't want to say that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that the councillors care insufficiently about this problem, even if we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brno is located in the waste separation in the jungle league, not only because we as citizens are only allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage cans for such waste.
Did they ever try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket, for example, at the centre?
This is just art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found by chance so far is the Moravia Square opposite the Goose.
Mr Onderka is not supposed to be angry with us by his colleagues, but this seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not a honey lick in other parts.
Whole rows of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
It's too far to get to the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles even after the celebration.
But on Konicova street I didn't see any colored waste bins in plain sight.
Fortunately, I came to the right place while driving a tram.
The garbage almost ran over, though.
This is still the centre of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics probably leave the Brno socialists cold.
They prefer to buy the city an ice hockey league that makes us shame throughout the Republic, instead of buying a few more garbage cans and offering the sorting of more raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has revoked the money for pensions and sick pay
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and civil servants despite the government's view, there is no longer any money in the budget for pensions, sick pay and building savings business.
But also not for the national debt interest or for the international court disputes.
That will cause even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half next year, says the finance minister, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the raise for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for the sensitive expenses, retirement pensions or for the sick pay in addition. "This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mine laying," says Janota.
The loans are usually paid for higher and higher interest rates, and you have to refund the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, where to get, the state treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state-owned enterprise are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those to whom the Left Party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children as well.
For the pensions or the sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state is in debt even more - next year, so will not only be 163 billion missing in the state treasury, but far more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will rise faster and faster and together with this also the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for compensation, then will no longer be enough to increase the VAT only slightly or to cut the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the transfer of money in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will also be missing next year for the expansion of the highways and railways.
These are predominantly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be redesigned and possibly cheapened.
At most, receive, which is also not free.
This means delay or discontinuation of thirty large buildings, the creation of Europe money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solve the outflow of money Solomonically - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, where the state is the owner of the majority, and from these the money are then distributed to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never secure and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, $18 billion went into the budget from CEZ.
Every year, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidations, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
With this trick, according to the rules of the EU, the actual budget deficit rises to the level of 5.7 percent GDP.
However, this does not end the carnival of the upheavals.
Nearly three billion fell the budget for various compensation for victims of communism and of crime or for expenses for the court disputes, even for building saving.
Whether the state can cope without that money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court battle, we have to pay for it anyway, Janota clarifies.
The minister must then save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the two-billion-project "Staatskasse" that has already begun, which should make it possible to monitor on-line what the individual authorities spend the money on.
The first stage starts in January.
Should the finance minister fail to find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions come, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will master two operating systems
The Americans expect a mobile phone for the future, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The presented plans look promising.
It is enough to press only one button, and Windows Mobile will become Android in a matter of seconds.
This is exactly the possibility that the American company VMware wants to introduce, which focuses primarily on the development of virtual software for the computers.
We enable you to perform two user profiles on your mobile phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, they can separate these into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware indicated during the interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
There will be 2012 in the market.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated the smartphone test pattern with two operating systems to the journalists.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM memory of 128 MB, on which the mentioned Windows Mobile and Android systems ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working together with the European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are to come to the customer within 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments hotel owners
Snowless slopes are not only worrying about the Giant Mountains residents.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in Giant Mountains you can still have free rooms for all winter dates incl. Christmas and New Year's Eve received.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, determine the prices, but by now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if, in our opinion, this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud," the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, led.
If you want the New Year's Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should no longer hesitate with the order.
If you prefer saving and where the quality of the stay comes second, you can try to wait a few more days.
The spindle mill hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year's Eve.
I think that they will continue to strive for a while to sell them, but then they have to give in, and respond to shorter times.
And then the free rooms will quickly dwindle, Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter dates always offer the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That’s why we’ve already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays for the last moment, the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert, said.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can also offer New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
Good sales are also found in the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest for the winter stays is also negatively influenced by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting to see if snow falls.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiebert.
Conversely and slightly better than last year, it is possible to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Eve and Christmas we only have a few free rooms.
There is great interest during the Polish holidays in January, and in February the business will also go well, informed the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also 80 percent occupied for the New Year’s Eve stays at the central car park in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free at Christmas in the latest hotel in Janske Lazne.
This year we were pleasantly surprised by January, for which we are currently about 60 percent occupied.
February is now a bit weaker, but the moment the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains certainly also increases, the director of the Hotel Omnia, Erik Sporysch, led.
The Giant Mountains hotel owners are now waiting for a larger snow cate.
On Thursday it should cool down and if it comes to rainfall, that should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, a warming is to come again, informed Jiri Jakubsky from the location of the Czech weather office in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is mother of prudence
It's almost funny with what kind of student aspiration Barack Obama, the president, with his reputation of the smartest, repeats his predecessor's strategy on the Afghanistan issue, which he himself thought was the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his eagerly awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it became apparent that he was writing these off via the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "just like in Iraq" in the text itself several times, he even used the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Forward Path" without hesitation.
In doing so, he himself criticized the Bush idea - sending fresh troop quotas to Iraq plagued by civil war - as an "irresponsible and in its conclusions a carastrophic decision."
However, the following months showed that the Bush strategy based on recommendations of the military was the only possible and in this respect very successful that people no longer speak at all in the news about Iraq today.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than was to be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will repeat itself.
The military has again asked him to increase the troop quota, especially the commander-in-chief of Afghanistan operation General Stanley McCristal, who even despite the subordination habits harshly criticized the procrating shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 troops to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he has at least cheated the general by 10,000 troops.
From Europe, he pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even if he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
Highly problematic about the entire Obama strategy is his intention to withdraw the troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Even despite the fratrical war of recent years, Iraq society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication - you can't rely on anyone and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is hard to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they were formally correctly founded, remain only fake buildings, behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to proliferate.
The balance of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the confusion of the circumstances that complicate the influences of Pakistan and Iran even further.
Building an "active state" that is the minimalist goal of the whole operation is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only deteriorated further and now it is on the verge of explosion.
Believe in this, believe that the little soldiers who have broken out into the war cry about the "early homecoming" create a miracle here, can only be a truly romantic soul, which is not impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take that up as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the battles in Afghanistan is running out.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush mountain range.
Another possible factor that can radically influence the situation is the development of events in Iran.
Should the situation continue to deteriorate and the increased sanctions do not affect the Iranians, a very serious question arises for the United States as to whether the problem cannot be solved with troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America is progressing to Obama for the winning withdrawal from Afghanistan.
However, any solution will also mean a dramatic turn of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years left until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to be able to resort to a different strategy if it would prove to be a total failure.
Bank Goldman Sachs managers no longer receive premium bonuses in cash
Senior executives at American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive premium bonuses in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers receive shares instead of the money, but they are only allowed to sell in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from the managers in the case if they act excessively risky.
According to the Reuters agency, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the wider direction in which it has to go, the former banker of the company JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott, led.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs set itself the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
The total premium bonuses over the course of this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to the Reuters agency, despite the measure indicated today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries with the start of the financial crisis.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intended to burden the banker's bonuses, which exceed £25,000, once with a tax of 50 per cent.
France is also preparing similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines, except in physics.
Five record women have today in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf adopted this year’s Nobel Prizes in the categories and for literature.
In addition to the four female scientists, among the German writer was also Romanian descent, Herta Müller, among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak for research in the field of chromosons.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to the Israeli Ada Jonath together with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for elucidation of the ribosome structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson have received for analysis of the economic report.
The only subject category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao have won this award for research in the fiber optics sector and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital chambers, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and certificate of the purchase of the cash prize.
This is ten million Swedish crowns in each category.
If there are several prize winners in each category, the cash prize will be divided among them.
Traditionally, the American president, Barak Obama, has already received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
He acknowledged in his speech the controversy of his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his path, and is also at the head of the country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
While respecting his policies, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the struggle for world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives the finance minister, Eduard Janota, early on Friday, who is thinking about his stay in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for next year in the form as this was released by the Assembly of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps also the remaining of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of Friday's meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the budget deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat, informed about the meeting.
Janota wants to negotiate his further stay in his function on Monday with the Premier, Jan Fischer.
According to the Budget Act, which now receives Klaus for signature, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
In parliament, however, the Left Party proposals for the circulation of money were voted on on Wednesday and the money for the state civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of the farmers were increased.
The government has countered the Social Democracy's proposals that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
A sharp domestic political dispute has therefore arisen between the Left Party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute, because of which the question mark about the further work of the Fischer-Beamtenkabinett, on the design of which the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party have agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures enforced by the Fishermen's government in the autumn, and which, according to their understanding, is intended to end the national debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, declared today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that "the untenable deficit" of public finances is for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no longer a good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which could build on a broader consensus of the political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, pointed out that the budget is atrocious, and the government should weigh its further existence.
The ODS deputy chairman, Petr Necas, told the CTK that the concept of the civil servants' cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
Premier Fischer described similar words in the editorial office as "strong pronouncements."
The CSSD chief, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the budget deficit was atrocious that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeds 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD rated the approval of the state budget for next year as a success.
The People's Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world much of the country, of whose struggle and victories, despite some criticisms, that the lead role was cast by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, racial conditions and Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid system of government in the South African Republic, as well as its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the American Oscar actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Another meaningful role is taken on by Matt Damon.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing area "Million Dollar Baby," already portrayed the movement's leader to abolish slavery, which has finally become a slave owner, a fictional USA president, and also God in "Evan Almighty," but only rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African national was in prison for 27 years for his active activity in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten," and at the same time that is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to unite the country. The new president, Mandela, knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through the sport, that's why he decides to agree the rugby players who are among the outsiders worldwide.
After all, the South African team advances to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role in order to bring it as closely as possible to reality, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge was, of course, to speak like he did.
The actor said if he and the world politician were to be in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands with Mandela.
I've found that when I shake your hand, I'll take your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt like I know what you're feeling, he said.
To me, it's important to have become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said that he had six months to prepare for the role in the tough rugby world.
It was a big surprise to him when he first met Pienaar at his home.
I remember when I rang the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie I look a lot bigger'.
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of the director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and one also speaks of prospects of an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, summarized his evaluation in the following words: "This was very good story, very well executed film."
In the film reviews on the web pages rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive evaluations.
Light secret over Norway dissolved: The Russians have tested a missile
A special light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Defense Ministry only yesterday acknowledged that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested not far from the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful, however, and the missile, dubbed the type "Bulava," which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become the nightmare of the Russian generality as well as the prime minister, Vladimir Putin.
Also, his repeated presence on the ground in the rocket test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava has mostly not been launched at all or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, one already writes about "Bulava" as above a "rocket that does not fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly but lights up
This one already 13. Try, proceeded normally in the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
Presumably, the engine exploded in the third rocket stage.
This time, "Bulava" took off from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was driving under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern paths was actually the damaged "Bulava."
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted since the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The generality has this time defended itself against it and claims that one cannot clearly speak of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fail and the accident affected only the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines were damaged in the first stage.
Even if there was no test start without error, the management of the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore fills the generality with optimism and so it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will once fly without problems and even up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. will carry 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defender Vjaceslav Fetisov introduces himself again in a professional ice hockey game at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup owner helps his team CSKA Moscow out in need, and probably already competes against Petersburg in Friday's duel KHL.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of the CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas injured himself, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has trained regularly and agreed that he will support the team.
We just need to clarify some remaining formalities, the agency AP quoted the coach of the Moscow Club of Sergei Nemcinov as saying.
Meanwhile, it is not clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will affect only one game.
I mean that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, listed fellow player Nemcinov.
When Fetisov comes back to the ice surface, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary striker Gordie Howe has played an entire season for Hartford at fifty-one and was able to credit himself with 15 hits and 26 assistants.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union, he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles and he has also triumphed in Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he twice overturned the Stanley Cup in the Detroit dress.
He has been a member of the ice hockey star room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is lifted
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the cancellation of all overtime.
Because of frequently ordered overtime, the union announced the willingness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not abandon our manufacturing plan, which is a principle, that is why on Saturday, the 19th December, voluntary overtime for the reason that two work shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company has offered a bonus of 400 CZK to the employees who would work the Saturday shift.
Employees will also receive this in retrospect for the Saturday shift of 28. November.
According to Vanek, the firm has decided to change the motivational style of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they pay the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement leave on 28. Taking December and thus extending the Christmas holidays, Vanek listed.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift are paid the fare and lunch.
With regard to the fact that overtime was the most urgent and burning point with regard to demands and complaints from the trade unionists who had ceased production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the cancellation of all overtime hours for the month of December, Vaněk pointed out.
The employees of the automobile factory had been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift until last week.
From the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are to be concluded on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they can agree on meeting the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the willingness to strike.
The situation in the automobile factory worsened last week, on Wednesday, as approx. 400 employees spontaneously went on strike because of constant overtime.
They also protested the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, held that the employees must make the overtime to comply with the automotive delivery requirements.
The unionists also demanded in their Monday strike readiness declaration that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday would not be slapped with sanctions.
In the area of overtime, unions are calling for overtime work to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they are demanding to pay out the fee of 5000 crowns this year.
The Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The series production was started in the company in November last year.
Until this September, approx. 80,000 vehicles manufactured, the current manufacturing capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ́stealed ́ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds designed to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the organism.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on the viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact outweighs the disadvantage that the compound does not have as strong an effect on conventional virus variants as one of the already existing drugs.
The disease AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the medication composition can prolong the patient’s life and prevent the reproduction of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the virus multiplication has also been developed by the development sg. Resistant viruses that are no longer effective against.
The work of the experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have demonstrated that the substances referred to as metalocarborans act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metalocarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus multiplication in a different way than all the drugs used today, therefore they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new ́improved ́ compounds, which have been prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metalocarborans have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-sized cages, which consist of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and are coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus split caused by the HIV virus split, no mature infection virus particles would emerge.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also eliminate the multiplication of the virus in the patient's body, the scientists explain in the press report issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the work published in the journal of medical chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of compounds in which two pairs of the cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further altered.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease has been tested in the test tube, even against their resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metalocarborans on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as in the case of the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metalocarborans interesting compounds for further research directed to the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fight over budget. ODS went after fisherman, who fights back
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "cruel" and the government of Premier of Jan Fischer should, in his opinion, consider its further existence.
The ODS's statement, the prime minister described as "strong pronouncements."
It is supposedly time for analysis.
The deputy ODS chairman, Petr Necas, said that the concept of the civil servants' cabinet, with the support of the CSSD, ODS and Green Party, obviously no longer works.
According to Necas, the prime minister must decide whether he intends to lean on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he is concerned about his remaining in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as Necas has pointed out.
Parliament on Wednesday adopted the budget for 2010, but with Link Party amendments to more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for state civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has countered the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should operate with a backlog of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS has left the hall before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because even the modified budget is only a less bad variant of the budget provisional. Frase not clear
Disappointment and futility
The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his disappointment and a sense of futility, whereas Prime Minister Jan Fischer has argued that the government is still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in case the amendments were adopted, the situation would look different.
According to Czech television, Janota has signed up for the Premier for Monday after the business of government.
In doing so, he has indicated that he is considering his further stay in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the bargaining of the budget.
According to Necas, the nominees of the Social Democracy (CSSD) who had enforced the changes in the budget have nothing to do in the government, according to Necas, to what extent Fischer advocates for the further struggle with the budget.
The prime minister should also say clearly that he will resign if parliament continues to adopt deficit-enhancing laws, for example those affecting sick pay and pensions or the service law amendment.
Topolanek: The ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
This is a matter for the Premier Fischer and the whole government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have made no mistakes, Topolanek has highlighted in a text message from the US.
It has mentioned that in some ministries, in a deputy function, there are people who are committed to TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to renounce the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament."
Then he supposedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the Citizens Democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that will be current, then I will deal with it, the Secretary of Defense Martin Bartak, nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, told the journalists in Parliament.
Premier Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon at the European Council.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Premier
Necas stressed at the same time that the ODS would likely vote against the amended budget in parliament on Wednesday if the Premier explicitly asked the MPs of the Citizens' Democrats to allow the budget to be adopted.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not young children, so he then responded to the question of whether the ODS was not pushed back in the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in parliament as well as in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize that my voice was missing.
Even when I renounced the mandate, I knew that in the next few months it would be mainly about Bolshevisation of Parliament and destruction all positive things, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for about the same fare.
The Czech Railways terminated or limited from 13. December some less busy express and local trains, while other connections are being strengthened.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most tariffs incl. Basic and customer driving tariffs will not be changed.
Several connection possibilities to the capital, for example, are given to the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the type Pendolino for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer express trains will also run on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route, in principle the direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned by the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), a total of eight percent, but Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tabor - Budweis route and several days a week will also be cancelled, and the operation of some express trains on the Prague - Pisek - Budweis route will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct traffic route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to change to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth route of the Esko suburban transport system, the opening of which is possible thanks to the railway electrification from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Central Station.
The CD introduces more connecting lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run at a time interval of two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been able to compete since 13. December no longer go to Bratislava.
This year's bill for regional railway: increase of 200 million
The express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, in total the railway will receive four billion crowns in order to settle the so-called liquidity loss in the next year, exactly as this year. The local trains supply the districts, paying a total of eight billion crowns for it next year, with the state shooting down three billion.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local trains as well as the express trains, the railway has concluded a ten-year contract, until now the contract has only ever been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps that is why it did not resort to the price increase in the large majority of tickets.
Changes occur only with one-day network tickets CD Net and for cheap Internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the CD Net price will be increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price eLiska will then depend on the driven track, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 crowns.
Philippine militants arrest more than 50 people, the children were released.
Millitants kidnapped 75 people today in the southern Philippines, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
That's what the agency AFP has cited, which originally only informed about 65 abductees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including a teacher.
The kidnapping occurred in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield in the escape from the police.
Local negotiators are now seeking the surrender of the remaining hostages.
According to the agency AFP, the millitants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), this is the weapons faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, police pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which called for revenge acts between the two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in Maguindanao province, the right of standing has been imposed because of the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of the 23rd November, which was related to the election to the governorship, was 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
But who resumed peace negotiations with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
South Africa's history affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
Over the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods arrives in American cinemas, "Invictus: the Unbeaten," which includes part of the life story of the former president of the Republic of South Africa, Nelsona Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who had already been chosen by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting actor role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the movie's theatrical release, reactions from critics as well as the public are also voiced.
Nelson Mandela
By full name his name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on the 18th. July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988 he received the Sakhar Prize, in 1993 together with de Klerk the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it is coming to cinemas at a time when preparations for the World Cup are culminating in South Africa, but at the same time the media is shaking up the world with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of residents on the part of the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are consistently positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations about the cast of leading roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I dreamed of this role for many years and prepared myself well for it.
Several times I also met Nelson Mandela personally, so that I can - as they say - receive his energy, he performed in the interview after the festival premiere of the film in Los Angeles.
I think that it is good if we can remember Mandela's personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book template of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated “In the role of the enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people, portrays the South African advocate of human rights within his first presidential election period.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and for years and days, separated populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also steps on the World Cup field, which South Africa won at the time, in his role in the South African national rugbydress.
For entering the lawn in the dress, which is considered almost like an ordinance in South Africa, Mandela reaped great ovations fourteen years ago, predominantly from the white audience and has thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be able to unite people into a single people, the rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa improves will only become apparent.
The white South Africans are skeptical, however, as revealed in recent interview for LN by the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK.
The championship begins on the 11th. June 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
In the fire, according to the spokesman of the district fire department Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened.
Originally, the fire department wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed the view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident did not endanger the safety operation of the pipeline system, according to the company spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will only be estimated after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For more than 10 years, nothing similar has happened to the company Ceps, mistakes of this species are rare, she added.
The power supply was not interrupted according to the spokeswoman of the company CEZ for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova,, the functioning of households, authorities and companies was not affected by the fire of the transformer station.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech territory as the sole operator of the power system, the electrical lines of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgear with 67 transformers, which transmit the electrical energy into the distribution system and cable path with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura files criminal charges for defamation against three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is filing criminal charges today for defamation against three social-democratic leaders.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview on the radio journal.
The lawsuit is related to the firm's effort to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have ultimately signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we are taking out the raisins, but we have only submitted the offer on the extent that it was coordinated with them.
They claim that we are expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were completed last week.
So we have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he led to the fact that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
Therefore, we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the criminal complaint to be the further continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as a free advertisement for his society as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear on this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail traffic and uses lying and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he had invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous move of the districts.
He told the radio journal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after New Year.
He clarified that he will lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was initiated by Jancura after the districts agreed on the establishment of regional rail transport with the Czech Railway and had not tendered for the contract in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of the train traffic in the districts, he threatened, according to Jancura, also already a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was if we do not forgo that we can lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, Jancura told the Radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococci free and voluntary
Infection against pneumococci will change the usual from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But already now, votes are coming in that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci are culminating.
The drug institute already sets the maximum prices of the vaccines that health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination process.
New vaccination
Vaccines free for August children
From January, children can be vaccinated free of charge against pneumococci, which will be vaccinated on the 2. August last year and later were born.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Anyone who has already started vaccination in the last year or earlier must also pay for further repeat vaccinations themselves.
The first dose of vaccine must be between 3rd and 5. of the child's life month.
Already last year, a quarter of the families had their children vaccinated against pneumococci.
The parents paid 1600 crowns and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
On the whole, the experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300,000 to 450,000 kronor per year on the vaccine doses.
However, you save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
Until now, the state has approx. 500,000 spent a year.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear infection, but also serious infections including cerebral inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections cause us to die after examination in hospitals per year up to 28 children aged up to 10 years.
Outside the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of the children against pneumococcals was carried out in approx. 40 countries introduced.
Will vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, this should be paid by the insurance companies and voluntary.
That the compulsory vaccination would be better, mentioned, for example, the head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky.
His association is already promoting the long-term pneumococcal vaccine.
The professionals at the international conference in which our association was involved were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
This isn't quite ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in at least enforcing that.
I believe that's the path we have to go now, Kalovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococci.
At this moment, we are not considering this at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, the doctors claim.
The chairwoman of the professional society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a volunteer," says Cabnochova.
The experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococci from next year.
The vaccination against pneumococci is also groundbreaking in the fact that this is the first area vaccination is paid for by the health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so they save for further treatment, explains Cabrnochova.
Doctors need to buy the vaccines themselves.
However, this is associated with a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of the vaccines.
According to the original project, the vaccines should be purchased through the insurance companies and the doctors should then receive them in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
However, some MPs feared that the insurance companies could thus "execute the money from the health insurance company."
That's why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay them these.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This is not going to be easy at all, says Cabrnochova.
US artist's son involved in 'museum theft'
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of trying to steal paintings worth $20 million from his father's museum.
According to Pennsylvania police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was captured while inviting 90 paintings into his vehicle with a trailer.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man had used an excavator to enter the museum in the Pocono mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press news agency reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police officer who said Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "that he should enter the museum by any means necessary to bring all the paintings to a camp."
The agency said Frank Frazetta denied Senior having given any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax hikes
Ministers have defended the tax hikes and spending freezes announced in the pre-edit report against criticism from the opposition, the economy and the unions.
Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "let an opportunity pass" to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by pushing the decisions out until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 percent increase in social security and a 1 percent cap on public wages for 2011.
Social security worries
Unions have protested that low-wage workers will be punished for a recession that they have not caused and warned of imminent "problems."
The increase in Social Security - to about £3 billion a year - has upset the private sector, which says this is a tax on jobs, although attention should be on the economic upswing.
The increase, which is limited to those who earn more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
FOCUS OF THE PRE-AUDIT REPORT
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, economy shrinking by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% tax on banker bonuses
1 percent increase in corporation tax for small businesses discarded
Tax reductions for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 a year poorer and someone with £40,000 a year will be £190 poorer, while a person with £10,000 in annual income will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their target of mitigating deficits by 2013 meant "difficult decisions," but they also said that 60% of the burden of additional taxes would be attributable to the 5% of the top earners.
Treasury Secretary Stephen Timms denied that the tax rises outlined and spending freezes would be "a drop on the hot stone" compared to the necessary measures.
“These are big numbers. They will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the period of the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour's predictions of future economic growth - which will affect the scope of new debt and the speed of deficit removal - were called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% drop predicted in April - while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
'Missed opportunity'
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis," said the planned £789bn debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to put forward a credible plan on how they will repay this and push themselves "cynically" before difficult decisions until after the election - which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They have said nothing of importance about what they are going to do," shadow finance minister Philip Hammond said. “They had their opportunity to do this and they let them pass by.”
“The significant announcements will not be made until after the election, whoever wins them.”
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be saved from future cuts, unlike in the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit cap faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money won by the tax hikes and spending freezes will be used to cover spending for next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "built on sand."
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that some of it would put the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the accusation of vote catching at the time of the announcements - such as the above inflation adjustment on some disability pensions next April - as the money could simply be retrieved next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra aid when people need it most and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hollow Budget"
Although ministers have not announced budget details beyond 2011, economists say pressure on public spending will only come into effect in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor's figures would mean hefty smears in many areas, possibly in the future also in the areas of transport, higher education, science and defence.
"It just shifts the pain to later," said its leader, Robert Chote.
"The significant announcements will not be made until after the election, whoever wins them," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser at the accounting firm Deloitte.
“This was just the hollow preliminary budget report. The markets recognize that.”
FBI investigates 'arrests of US citizens in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a home in Sarghoda, in the eastern Panjab province, the American Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether those are the same men who were reported missing in the US state of Virginia last month.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges they are accused of and under what circumstances they are being held," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, in case it is actually the missing students," she said.
The Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the men were arrested at a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said local police had been interested in the house earlier and that no charges have yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but she said the U.S. must "work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in eradicating the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people."
The five students were reported missing by their families in northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns 'abuses' in Iran
According to a report by the human rights group Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still just as bad as they have in the past 20 years.
The report detailed "abuse patterns" by the regime, both before, and after the contested presidential elections in June.
A man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes. Another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
After the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and dozens killed, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the start of the protests, the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse claims and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
'False confession'
Amnesty International quoted the report by 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and for protesting the election results.
"They punched me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
“I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on the head. They threatened me with death and they humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and, still bleeding and half unconscious, was released on the street, Amnesty said.
Beaten presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted that abuses took place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he had been held in a container at a detention centre in Kahrizak with 75 others for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the court authorities had set up a committee to investigate the unrest after the election and the government's responses to it, but according to Amnesty, the mandates and power of these organs would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees had not been published.
The group said at least 90 people have been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Ski slope has been set up in the city park
More than 100 tonnes of artificial snow have been used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a competitive runway.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who were fighting for cash prizes.
On the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short ski jump at the beginning of a 100-metre-long slope.
Student John Hickman, who is studying medicine in her fourth year, said there was a gorgeous view from the summit of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the city's lights that glitter below.
He added: "It's some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some proper talent."
Prizes were awarded for the best feats performed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and us
Can Islam be French?
pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted in favour of a ban on minarets and concerns about the alleged Islamization of Europe are widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out account of whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe's declaredly secularized societies - and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's last work: "Why the French Don't Love Headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and densely arguing study of a contentious issue that divided and occupied the country over a decade and a half and whose effects are still to be perceived today.
Bowen's latest book offers a more comprehensive and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he not only wants to know what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer "Islamic freedom" to the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls it.
He's a good listener, he reiterates debates between teachers and students about the questions that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim marry (or both) in a mosque or town hall?
Should young Muslims be taught about the evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-rated banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, quite contrary to the political dramas that preoccupy the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen in a modern secular society on the other.
They don't have all the arguments on their side.
The conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists that Bowen interviewed are mostly at a disagreement with their Salafi counterparts – advocates of purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a convention requires a give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite, the so passionately guarded the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may experience a rougher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "tightening of the screws of values" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet."
The world's most bleak outlook
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes them melts at an alarming speed and takes life with it that can't survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have entered the recently open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Improved in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in the hunt for the polar bear.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign to the sea, who only struggled with the rifle butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the beginning of the 20th Century featured 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoo facilities still typically own one-millionth of the living area of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore became quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians, and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the slaying continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and snowmobile-driving Inuit use powerful assault rifles to take down their prey.
Ironically, in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations, the ice will remain the longest.
In his new book, "After the Ice," Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist," offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future might develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of the changes.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanation attempts.
The pioneering journeys of Fridtjof Nansen at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th. Century, for the first time, the swirling of the pack ice was anticipated.
Submarines measured the shifting ridges during the Cold War during the underrun.
A useful addition is satellite surveys and the large-scale application of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by intrepid people who camp outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look into the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice formed by saltwater channels that are compressed when frozen.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopically small wonders in the ice, everyone is threatened by it when the summer ice passes, which is expected in the period between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months ... this could be us”
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
The superior De'Angello Robinson arrived by bus for seven hours to put a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Cemetery in Arlington to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they followed.
In a few months, from where we're always being brought back, we could be that, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I would wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered Saturday morning to put wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of the Arlington cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the funeral wreath manufacturer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, established this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundred graves in the cemetery in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who undertake this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a nonprofit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has extended the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at the Arlington cemetery, in areas at the Pentagon, on graves of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York, and at the Memorial Site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 for the second time to purchase and transport the wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give back to those who made sacrifices.
She said that's a small contribution to how we civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family burial site.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the cemetery's extensive lawns and hills.
The volunteers had older graves from the 1st and 2. World War and the Vietnam War as a destination, since these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held hands while carrying the fresh pine branches to the greying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mainly veterans of the wars are buried in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained almost calm.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Individuals cried openly, others prayed and families and friends held on to each other in the icy air.
Some read out loud the names carved in stone, while others bent down to small black-and-white place cards, which had been put into the damp mud for those whose tombstones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son's grave.
She has driven 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the tomb of Marine Infranterie sergeant David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free ..., my son has paid for it, she said.
“When I’m not in a long time, I want someone to remember him.”
U.S. government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a contractor from the U.S. government that sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, is working for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for clients, such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and for the World Bank.
Consular officials of the U.S. advocacy group in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee, who was arrested on the 5th. December was arrested.
The special charges have not yet been made public, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything under the allegation of "endangerment."
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, carry a risk of arrest.
Anti-government graffiti and statements are considered a serious crime.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, who often describes how she and her husband are persecuted and attacked by government officials.
Sánchez has repeatedly asked for a permit to leave the country to accept prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to boost tensions between the Castro brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy attaches importance to the fact that the United States will provide in return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in that direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after products in a country where a government employee's average earnings are $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only been allowing ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone conversation would cost a daily wage.
Internet use is extremely restricted on the island.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there to foreign visitors and at some government sites, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in frequently have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press secretary for the U.S. advocacy agency in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the delivery of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the "Human Rights Watch" group, which recently published a hard report on freedom in Cuba titled "New Castro, equal Cuba," a nod to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, who replaced the sick older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants would very often be arrested, convicted and detained within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards each other for more willingness to dialogue.
Pakistani government officials uncover plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday discovered an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, saying they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruiters searching the internet for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he tracked them down because one of them on the internet video site YouTube had made approving comments on terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt, which is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camp.
But a representative of Pakistan's intelligence service who was briefed on the matter said Saturday that Saifullah could not convince al Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to inferior the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a terrorist refuge.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That's why they were rejected, said the government official, who asked to remain anonymous because of the sensibility of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to try to get the right recommendations to gain access to the Al Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani correctional authorities.
The case of the five men - who continue to be in Pakistan and are questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying future terrorists and possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of the 11th In September 2001, the U.S. Secret Service made it a matter of the utmost urgency to accommodate human assets within Al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to special scrutiny by A Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US goals and propaganda value, they are also considered tremendously attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, the highest-ranking analyst at the NEFA Foundation, based in the U.S., said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow access to, because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to inject someone into these groups, what better way could you go than follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?," Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate "action" in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate action from the negotiators at the city's Bella convention center.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be about 25,000.
The event went relatively peacefully, though a handful of masked activists detonated small explosive devices near some government buildings in the city centre.
On a day when little happened in the UN-sponsored climate negotiations, thousands of activists wandered through the city with banners that read in English "There is no Planet B" and one in Spanish, the declared "The Earth says "Enough."
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother's country of birth, make her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is struggling with due to the already noticeable effects of climate change.
That's part of the motives why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to pass the word on and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it needs to be done now and there's no way left to lead around it.
Police stopped protesters from getting too close to the Bella centre and said they had arrested 19 people, largely due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a spectator who did not want to be named as he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing detonated several explosive devices near the main Copenhagen canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but were then followed by "a few large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration all afternoon.
But the protest has apparently failed to reach the awareness of the main officials, such as Su Wie, China's chief climate negotiator, apparently.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not even aware of".
He then continued in Mandarin and said, "Because the venue is big, I can't hear what's happening outside."
He noted that it depended on the individual's perspective whether the demonstration would hurt or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Examination data shows persistent racial divide
The certificates of mathematics performance were welcome good news for the public schools in Washington D last week. C.
Although the district of Washington is still far behind the country's schools that produce top performances, the testimonies show that the fourth- and eighth-graders have made faster progress over the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
What is included in the latest figures of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national level.
The average score of white fourth graders from Washington D. C. rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, but that of her African-American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African-American eighth-graders basically remained the same, it fell by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was captured in this district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score that children of both groups have reached has grown in this period, the difference has hardly decreased with now 58 points.
Some education advocates of the district expressed their concern last week that the results, those of school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and the Democratic Mayor Adrian M. Fenty were celebrated, for the most part by white students, who are already high-performing children anyway, have been driven forward.
This suggests that we have raised the overall standings by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, D.C.'s board member. Voice, a nonprofit group dedicated to educational equality in Washington D. C. occurs.
I'm not jumping up and down for a span of two or three points," said Democratic Washington City Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a common critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of exam scores is that the city's middle schools desperately need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
What scares me, however, is that we do not spend nearly the time and energy we would have to devote to our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of the low-performing students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, which is aimed at students in the upper classes of primary school and middle school, which basic skills of reading have not mastered at the beginning of their school career and that lag significantly behind their classmates of the same age.
Everyday mathematics, a curriculum that brings games and lifelike experiences to the fore from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former senior school inspector Clifford Janey and this curriculum is attributed to some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I mean that we must continue to work to let the best measures benefit students who are below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while continuing to provide the extra money and resources to the low-performing schools that are needed to reduce the divide.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of education at the University of California at Berkeley, who is studying urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington D.C.
The objective could create political after-effects that are working against this important item on the agenda.
The weak point, of course, is, as with other urban school inspectors, that she is trying to hold the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to make sure we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighbourhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive an excellent public education.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements for closing the benefit divide is to extend the traditional public school year, which is currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with the charter schools.
One has to raise the school year to nearly 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers' union last year on an agreement on 185 days a year, which he considers "a milestone" on the road to a greater increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a future prospect
The coach reaches the Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald lawn.
Graciela's parents barely graduated from high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was recovered at Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the group's other eighth-graders exploring Gettysburg, where classes cost $38,690 a year, were more like that of an awe-inspiring visitor than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes! Here I will be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medicine when the guide announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when she was told the school's low-professor-to-student ratio.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th the kids attended on their three-day tour and now they've fully taken up the intended message: The question isn't whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education needed to advance to the middle class.
In truth, one in five of those "second generation" of Hispan-Americans is completed from college -- which is a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without having graduated high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they are showing the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who examine high-performing children say these often have a natural affinity for school and an inherent drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role by helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if those efforts persist for a longer period of time.
Looking at low-income children whose parents do not have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at any point will not solve the problem either, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis, who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool to high school.
The federal program that had funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP - and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to launch college preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and keep running until they have graduated high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom have gone to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry Signs Contracts with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies by Iraq's oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play a major role in the renovation of Iraq's oil industry, which has been paralyzed by war and economic sanctions for decades.
American companies could only book shares in two of the 10 fields auctioned for themselves.
Seven American companies had paid for participation in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the shorter.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly sown representatives of American oil multinationals in opening Iraq's oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asian and Europeans are setting the way, Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, said of an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns still underscored by massively coordinated bombings on Tuesday and the political instability caused by the withdrawal of the U.S. military have likely stopped American oil companies, so analysts said they are more involved in Iraq, which owns the world's third-largest proven crude oil reserves.
U.S. firms have been at a disadvantage in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower wage costs and are more likely to take risks because they don't have to account for shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that could enter into contracts with the Department.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with Iraq's oil ministry and have stood by with technical advice in recent years, have gone blank.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the greats of the global economy, as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its fellow bidders and will meet its obligations to Iraq.
Preselected companies for the bid submitted bids, which were then compared with the fee per barrel of oil that the ministry was willing to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner apparently killed in Pakistan
In an apparent U.S. missile strike along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, a top Al Qaeda deployment planner is said to have been killed this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials reported Friday.
This would be, if confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior official of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs who, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials of the region, are said to have been killed by a number of missiles that hit their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, an official from a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the spot and quickly took to themselves everything left of the "completely destroyed bodies."
Local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the U.S. counter-terrorism cited indefinite evidence that Somali was among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading military planner of Al Qaeda, leading operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who asked to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate nature of the U.S. air strikes on Pakistani soil.
If one assumes his central role as a given, this also included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from Al Qaeda's top leaders and put them into operation planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had quickly risen in the Al Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best ties to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, the second official said, but this by no means diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If his death were confirmed, Somali would be the second leading Al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September when Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists were killed in a similar attack.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined from an average of six operations a month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be based on improved tactics of the terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
Leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The U.N.'s leading envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would resign from his post in March, ending a stormy term marred by claims of widespread corruption in the U.N.-backed Afghan presidential election.
Oath's departure occurs when the Obama administration decided to send another 30,000 U.S. soldiers to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supports the troop increase, but he also expressed his concerns that the U.S. timetable for the military withdrawal, which is scheduled to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment has to be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aid workers to help in Afghanistan's political conversion.
The increase in troops on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said that he did not resign from office, but only fulfilled an agreement reached with his family in March 2008, to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to UN-
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now forward so he has time to provide for a replacement.
What I've said is that he's better starting to seek a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
Ban has begun the search for a replacement, according to UN representatives.
The UN representatives say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, who indicted him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and covering up evidence of massive voter fraud.
Eide has denied all the accusations, but he also said that the allegations made by Galbraith - who was fired - "no doubt harmed the mission because already a great deal of skepticism existed in terms of international interference in the election."
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led armed forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged that the U.N. leadership allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries donating to the Afghan mission, and said that this would boost their confidence in ensuring that their money is being deployed properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at restricting his forces in Afghanistan, saying the cumbersome UN hiring arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I have only been able to hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not continue like this.
US Defense Secretary Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for failing to participate in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates spoke during a 7-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of ca. 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
There are no good opportunities to vote in Iran, he said in response to a soldier's question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, is the war’s own unpredictability.”
The Obama administration is considering a sanctions package targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is in reality less protected with nuclear weapons" because "its people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the American government joined European leaders in warning that Iran must face "credible" consequences if it fails to meet the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear surveillance agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency, with its nuclear program.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should only be gained for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1. October, Iran said it would resume talks to restrict its nuclear program and would forgo a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for much-needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this kind of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
Iran, however, appears to have since left negotiations on the preliminary agreements -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership disagrees on whether they should commit to the United States.
That Iran simply left the international community standing in terms of some proposals they had already agreed to in early October, has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, together in a way that they never were in conjunction with key additional sanctions for Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has the 31st Dec. set as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "suffocating sanctions."
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian representation to the United Nations condemned what it on Thursday called "fundless and unfounded claims" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying they are ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to achieve a suitable long-term solution."
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq for meetings with the soldiers in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
The tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq continue to be high, especially in terms of borders, property rights and because of the division of public revenue.
Gates urged both sides to lower the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to cut American troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to dispel Kurdish concern about the imminent troop withdrawal. U.S. officials quoted Gates, who told Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, said: "We will maintain your security, prosperity and autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A change of course in aging China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that gave them lectures that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "A baby more means a grave more."
These lessons they have learned so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who through the low birth rate and the ageing population suddenly began to change course this summer and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their response was immediate and definitive: "No way."
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There's nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the one-child policy in China, which has produced two generations of notoriously fat, warped single children affectionately called "little emperors," a population crisis is drawing up in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into effect, the UN puts.
Department of Population Issues firmly, while the number of the population of 60 years and older is expected to increase explosively from 16.7 percent of the population by 2050 to 31.1 percent. This is well above the global average of approx. 20%.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older people accounted for nearly 22 percent of Shanghai's reported residents, while the birth rate has been below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that couples of procreative age need to have babies to "help reduce the ratio of the ageing population and alleviate the labor shortage of the future."
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A gradual relaxation
Enshrined in the country's constitution in 1978, China's one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial injunction introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy must expect huge fines -- up to their triple annual salary in some regions -- and with discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical strain on natural land resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of politics.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had gender-selective abortions performed, creating an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government officials for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities, and cases where both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many hard slogans was tempered.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Beijing's Institute of Population Research, said that government officials have even recently discussed more radical changes, for example, allowing couples two children where a partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters that taught families to have only one child were replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for approval.
The city administration has sent out city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push through information sheets under the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial counseling for those who have more than one child.
The response was not exactly encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a small rural town in the outskirts of Shanghai said that an upswing can be seen in the applications of couples who want a second child after the start of the campaign, the urban districts, on the other hand, do not report any change.
In the case of the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still received per month as an example.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births expected for 2010 in the city, despite the campaign, is still at ca. 165,000 will be -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of Shanghai's Caolu community, said financial considerations are likely to be the main reason why many people don't want to have more children.
They want to give the best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this was also legally permissible.
But they, like many Chinese, have only minor health and life insurance from the government.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, we are being robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
The problem, however, is not simply in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, said she only wants a child because she was also an only child. “We were the center of the family and used to everyone to take care of us.
We're not used to taking care of others and we don't really want to do that either."
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it more bluntly.
For parents from the middle class with a double career, through which the birth rate drops, he said, it's about being successful and for that you have to be selfish.
The age group of the now 20- to 39-year-olds grew up with seeing their parents fight during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they do not want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of parents.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the space question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "When the child is 9 months old, you already have to have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are ready to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts emission reduction plan
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild poses and mutual accusations -- set a focus again on Friday with the publication of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrialized nations having to shoulder the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement regulating greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as a major advance in a negotiation that runs out of time as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent about the amount of money that rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can master global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for the key issues, including how developed and large emerging economies can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policymakers would support should be.
The process will be given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has summarized a 180-page negotiating text to put the spotlight on what the UN's leading climate change advocate, Yvo de Boer, has described as "the big picture."
It shows the floor plan of a possible agreement in which developed nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, countries could cut emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave a boost to Friday's talks through its assurances to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impacts of climate change - from mastering floods and droughts to avoid deforestation.
Friday brought the same verbal fireworks that had determined the talks in the last week.
The American climate special representative Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for binding reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger emerging economies, if these are not funded by the industrialized nations.
That move announced that the Obama administration is running a tougher line with China than representatives of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign a deal without major emerging economies standing up and taking action, according to Stern, who also complained that the text did not go far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern gave his statement an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei's statement said the leading American climate negotiator was either lacking in "sanity" or it was "highly irresponsible" of him that he said earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially manage global warming.
Due to the fact that the future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, fracture lines have opened up both within the industrialized nations and between the industrialized nations and the emerging countries.
The current struggle relates equally to the rescue of individual economies, as well as to the rescue of the planet, with China and the United States coming up because of their corresponding commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the major powers are struggling to pay for the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to more aggressively in bringing countries accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game that will develop a new economic supremacy, according to Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change adviser for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, though the leading participants say the talks will lead to a political agreement at best.
The Alliance of Small Island States with 43 members presented a 24-page draft treaty early on Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Butcher, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the offensive of small island states "puts political pressure on the entire political process," partly because they are now united and demand action from emerging countries, such as China and India.
The talks got a new urgency when delegates focused on the fact that most of the outstanding issues have yet to be clarified before the arrival of government leaders to come to an agreement.
Senior representatives, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Vice Minister stepped out of their planes and raced through the Bella Center's aisles to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to stake out claims that will be negotiated during next week.
The pure extent of the gathering -- 13,000 people go in and out daily at the convention center, guitar-playing activists host nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling, and draft contracts are passed on from hand to hand instead of by email -- already poses a challenge.
The intensity is just beginning to build: almost all the key ministers are here now and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We are coming to the upper league, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global politics of the organization Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h fast train redefines Monday's feeling
Monday morning at 5 a.m. 13, a whistle will penetrate the darkness to announce a train run that represents a revolution in traffic in Britain.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will be on its lightning journey from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Reach Pancras 225 km/h and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the transport minister, Dame Kelly Holmes will then embark on board the first Javelin commuter service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain to an international rail network of faster, reliable trains and will connect the major metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the north and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, work times would be radically reduced and the switch from plane and car to train would reduce national carbon emissions and traffic jams on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still be putting the brakes on Britain's high-speed tracks.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company founded in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, Lord Adonis will report on the 30th, according to the Times. Presenting December.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new rail line, which is supposed to connect London with the West Midlands, will carry with a five-metre leeway past urban areas and in places where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final route.
HS2 is also set to create three options for a larger, northward-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will react to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route in which a single high-speed line would lead into the West Midlands.
The route would split in or near Birmingham and one turn-off would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another heading north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-functioning option," said one railroad insider.
Upon completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would decrease to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not open before 2025, would allow travellers to cover the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour today.
The designs would give the trains the opportunity to travel at a speed of 400 km/h, making the UK rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400-meter-long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can run on it.
Up to 18 trains could be operational per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that a term stop would be needed in London, where 20,000 travellers per hour could be handled.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, an existing station is expected to be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Rail experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not this plan should be continued in his opinion, but the lengthy public advisory and planning measures mean that a final decision will not be made until after the general election.
But even when he sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
Trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in north Birmingham, which would make the journey time between London and Scotland to remain above three hours.
This is considered a decisive sticking point for ensuring a change from the aircraft to the railway, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers pay for mortgage for £75,000 Orangery of a Conservative
Alan Duncan, the Conservative's leading lower house member, has charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he had built in his home in his constituency.
The party's prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that lower house members must live "from lean rations," has increased his mortgage by £75,000 to have an oak timber half-timbered annex built to his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the extra interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month.
Those in charge of the House of Commons approved the applications at the time and they were also not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the expenses of the lower house members. Last night, Duncan said the motions could not have been "even cleaner or more understandable."
Duncan, one of the richest lower house members, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby homes have achieved a purchase price of almost a million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining room, but the Fees Office, a spending checkpoint of the House of Commons, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he grew a conservatory called "orangery" in the plans.
Neighbors described him as a "glass house for entertainment."
Duncan was also not asked to comment on increased cash raising during a recent investigation of his previous mortgage contracts by the Committee on Standards and Privileges.
The committee acquitted him of the breach of regulations last month after an investigation into its spending.
In 2004, Duncan transferred security for a mortgage of over £271,406 (300,000) from his London home to his constituency house, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a member of parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan was refunded about £1,400 (1,500 euros) a month as a mortgage rate by March last year.
In April, his claims rose to more than £1,800 (2,000 euros) a month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage has not changed during this period, suggesting that the entire increase served to finance the £75,000 (85,000 euros) cash-taking.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents released by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to assert his right to £1,250 (1,400 euros) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader of the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him in the process when he said after the spending scandal that MPs would live "from meagre rations."
“Essentially, when you work for the state, it means you have to live off lean rations and be treated like s*****e.”
He said: "I have spent my money on my garden and are entitled to a vanishingly small proportion, measured by what is heard.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The member of parliament, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked in May for his spending when it became clear that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had clarified with the Fees Office that this "could be seen as an exaggerated demand."
An activist has dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign as a protest in Duncan's lawn after it became known that he had demanded £4,000 (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for value increase."
He added: "There is no debate about evasion and meandering or bending the rules or the like.
Everything is perfectly transparent and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn’t be cleaner and clearer.”
Come all of you believers to admire Brighton's beach hut Advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new way of living as an interactive advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond," an alternative church group that spurs on to spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each December day with Christmas carols as a theme.
The event started on 1. December and visitors were allowed to view the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruit.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the cottage decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer cleric of the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society again.
Why do we, as a church, expect people to come into a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and host thrilling celebrations.
The idea for the Strandhütten Advent Calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to express this through our spirituality."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to call for an ambitious and mandatory agreement on the fight against global warming, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people have marched in the cold of the Danish capital, according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which was to lead to a conclusion by Friday that could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for the climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the "political price" of a failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place a short time after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed all in black, smashed shop windows with paving stones and hammers, a journalist told AFP.
Anti-unrest police officers intervened immediately and without regard.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your assessment mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in the east of France, in April, were arrested.
The Climate Justice Action (CJA) coalition, one of the organizers of the demonstration, has sharply criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction," and has underlined that about a hundred of them were "still held in the streets on Saturday evening," despite the extreme cold with handcuffs and in seating position.
The rather peaceful move has gone from parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 metres from the building without attempting to get in.
A stage was installed to welcome the intended speakers, for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
The majority of the protesters arrived by trees and trains from the major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans were present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you with sky-blue raincoats, have made a first casserole in the morning in Copenhagen as you have followed the call of the Friends of the Earth to form "blue tides" for the "climate justice."
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a redress of the ecological guilt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry out, watercourses where you can walk, just as it has never been in the past.
For the first time in the history of climatic diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN agreement, the movement of globalization critics has approached the environmental organizations.
MEP José Bové, figure of the critics of globalisation, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are located, which are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the launch of the demonstrations.
About 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to organisers.
In Manila, there were a few hundred people, mostly students, who have marched in red and hoisted bandanas where you have praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or Djakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred protesters took place to demand a vigorous approach against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the "350" network have gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people have gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounced that this is a "prank."
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, this happened a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilissi denounced the "prank."
Some 131,000 people were called upon to participate in the first election after the August 2008 Russian-Georgian war for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 5 p.m. GMT.
The turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station closure, according to the Abkhazian electoral commission official.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night from Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of a reunification with Georgia condemning the election.
These elections are a farce.
For his part, the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakachvili, regrets that Abkhazia is now under a total Russian occupation, his press secretary, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as a part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After separating from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia would like to prove by means of this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, has explained Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claimed to have chosen for Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to a polling station, which was located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful landscapes on the black sea.
Large signs on which Bagach can be seen alongside the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are everywhere in this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to oversee the election.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to Moscow's support, especially regarding the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, answered Alexei Ostrovski, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka in the process.
The opposition, for its part, represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements made with Moscow the previous year, as the one in which Abkhazia leaves Russia the control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reach this limit, a second round of voting must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated all over the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding treaty from the Copenhagen Climate Conference, where the police, ready to work at any time, about 700 people, on the sidelines of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, a hundred thousand according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will receive delegates from 193 countries by December 18, who are looking for an agreement to come into force on 1 January 2013.
From parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where negotiations are taking place.
The protesters have stopped about 500 metres from the centre and have not tried to enter.
A stage was set up to welcome the intended speakers for an evening with candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
A few moments after the train passed, a group of protesters dressed all in black and armed with bricks and with hammers have begun to smash slices, a journalist told AFP.
Anti-restlessness police immediately encircled you and intervened without regard by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the Blacks Blocs, these extremely violent splinter groups, who have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a policeman suffered an injury to the chin during the incidents, in which, according to the police, about twenty people were provisionally arrested, on the chin. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We have the extreme groups under control," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen explained, while the police forces' helicopters circled in the air.
Most of the protesters who arrived by train or by vehicle from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in the sky-blue raincoat, formed in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be repaid to the people of the South," activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines declared in Copenhagen.
"We can't say to ourselves anymore : We still have time," says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses through which you can walk, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of the opponents of globalization has approached environmental protection organizations.
The French MEP of the European Parliament and critic of globalisation José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." “There is no longer any difference today between the fight against global warming and the struggle for another world.”
The organization Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen or the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are addressing the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given the impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, approx. 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red with bandanas, have advertised in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital for solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Djakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined forces during the "network of 350" demonstrations, particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and in Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycéen.
The national education minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview, which appeared in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche", that the subjects of geography and history emerge strengthened from the school reform of the Lycéen, even if they are in the terminals (12. school year) not being taught compulsory.
“The students of the Première (11. School year) now have all four hours a week and the same program," confirms Mr. Chatel.
For the minister, "this hypocrisy must be overcome," because according to him, "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile," but, by and large, a concentration of "the best students."
"The economic-social and the literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific," he continued. “I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who were outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminal on technical Lycees.”
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten French people (69%) were the state project of cancelling compulsory teaching in history and geography in Terminale S (12. school year with scientific profile) criticize. Many teachers and intellectuals also criticized this project, as well as the left and some representatives of the right.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question regarding a limitation of the philosophy of the Terminale S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended education reform for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which in their opinion is the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister stated that they undergo a subject-related aptitude test in the Master 2 (M2) at the beginning of the year and an admissions examination at the end of the year, in which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they perform internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He continued to say: "If you add all the internships offered before the performance exam, you'll achieve even more hours you've spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours."
The minister eventually stated that he would like to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed again that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012."
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d’Ulm in Paris.
According to a journalist from the AFP, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, at which experts each turn to the audience for fifteen minutes with filmed contributions.
You want to do something with which you reach the people and awaken in them the feeling of wanting to learn more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22 years and one of the organizers of this day, on the sidelines of the conference. The name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the base of the school.
"Around the twenty participants in the discussion were selected among the experts, even after their charisma," he clarifies.
“You can talk about global warming for hours. However, the core goals can also be set out in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel told AFP, which was approx. 50 people only freed with the help of foils.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he underlined, in the hope that listeners may learn that "the Copenhagen Conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos shot by these conferences will be available from the 15th. December can be found online on the school's website.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months after that.
Payment delay : angry prison guards, actions planned
The unions of penitentiary officials on Friday called for a general day of action to ensure that the premiums and overtime, the pay of which was deferred for budget reasons until January, will be transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2. Union of Correctional Officers ("FO-Pénitentiaire"), urged the employees, who have no service, to demonstrate on Tuesday morning in front of the prison and block it to draw attention to the "theft of what they are entitled to".
The 3. Union of Correctional Officers ("CGT-Pénitentiaire") called for "unification for a strong mobilization in the various prisons," on which the non-payment of the overtime, night surcharges incurred in October, as well as the Sunday and holiday surcharges in December will be branded as "disgraceful and unacceptable."
The first union of correctional officers, the Autonomous Federal Penal Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The management of the prison and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime hours rose sharply in 2009 and not all were provided for in the budget. However, they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Michèle Alliot-Marie has sent the unions of the correctional officers a letter, in which it is guaranteed that the payment will be made next month.
"I am very well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functional and modernize it," the justice minister said in a statement.
"I have instructed the management of the correctional facility to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen from a lack of assessment of the overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," added Ms. Alliot-Marie.
The December wage is therefore meagre, except for the management staff, which benefits high service and target premiums, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" have to be used.
"This is an absolute scandal," the interregional trade union FO in Marseille revolts, announcing that it will boycott "all assemblies and convocations" pending new instructions.
“The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays, when the hours from October in December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without hiring more staff, trying to enrich themselves at the resources of the staff is more than inappropriate," according to the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions. Some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-François Forget.
Obama believes he always distributes better gifts to Christmas than he gets himself.
The American president, Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family in the White House for the first time, has told TV talkmaster Oprah Winfrey that he always distributes better gifts than he gets himself.
At a special broadcast aired Sunday night across the channel ABC, the president and his wife Michelle gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the small four-legged companion of the family, will be part of the game.
"Santa Claus also loves Bo," Michelle Obama affirms, adding that the dog, of course, also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly dismissed her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you beautiful gifts in the past year," she teases the president.
"So please," he summoned her mischievously, pointing to the first lady's pearl necklace: "And who gave it to you?"
During this hour-long broadcast in casual atmosphere with the well-known television presenter whom Barack Obama had so vehemently supported during his election campaign, the president and his wife also talked about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a bicycle with ten gears and also a basketball that his father, whom he saw very rarely, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us once Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The first lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
“I didn’t know at all how to arrange the furniture in a house, so I put it all on the wall instead of grouping it around the fireplace. But I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle Obama recounted.
Johnny Hallyday surgery again, RTL confirms he has been put into artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for significant "damage" following surgery in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation is "under control," although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors "damage as a result of surgery of a herniated disc," which he was on the 26th. November had suffered in Paris, had found, according to his production company in Paris, which added that this damage would have required renewed surgery.
The production company of the singer nevertheless wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and announced that a new medical report would be available in 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the partner during the singer's final tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications."
Only after 48 hours, however, one had a little more certainty about the patient's condition when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of the AFP, there was neither a confirmation nor a comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it emerges from certain sources" that "no drainage whatsoever" was laid after its first operation in Paris.
The rocker had undergone surgery at Parc Monceau's international clinic for a herniated disc.
The procedure planned over several days was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday evening for comments to RTL.
After Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection after the procedure.
The singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, was of the view to RTL on Thursday that his friend was just going through a "deep valley." However, he assured that there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter".
“He had called me before he left for Los Angeles. I told him it was bullshit to sit on a plane for twelve hours after such an operation, that's not possible," Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday was "reacting well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection was contained."
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he felt no particular concern in the process.
Still, concern for the singer's health had grown ever greater since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, there was general astonishment that Johnny Hallyday had a "small colorectal cancer surgery," which resulted in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer took up his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been commented on extensively. Fans and journalists have not escaped that the singer struggled to move on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny a new hospital.
Euro-2009/Short Track: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, three-time medalist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, clinched an international title over his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 on the short track in Istanbul on Thursday.
On the first day of this competition, on which the polyurethane suits were allowed for the last time, there were only three world records, while one had expected a true record flood.
One record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of the men.
Too bad for Bousquet, who wanted to reach for the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big basin (20.94).
At one of the two royal distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman asserted himself in 20.53 sec,. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a premiere at international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
“You can believe in ever greater things and in the present case I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try.”
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which started from the 1. January 2010 is banned.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began for the first time in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in the basin this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has failed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give it my all this time.
I knew I couldn’t win a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my job.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
USA: Grave slab at Zola estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tomb, which appeared with the French writer Emile Zola, was on Thursday at 1.5 million. US dollars estimated above their value, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It is from the III. century A.D. and was always valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, on which "four scenes of Dionysus are depicted in a sophistic architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Baccus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiques at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
"The sale is still ongoing, but this part is certainly what the buyers have offered the most for so far," Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this purchase of the marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was at home in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, after which she dived piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who was used for it in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, minister in the III. French Republic and President of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next fifty years are in the dark.
While browsing the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this record was part of an "Erbee of Emile Zola," which opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart."
Zelaya's exit attempt from Honduras towards Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya on domestic soil to be incompatible after that escort by the coup government rejected as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place during the night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement on the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister for Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration authorities, the aircraft provided by the Mexican government, which was on Wednesday in Salvador for the purpose of the transfer M. Zelayas had arrived, returned to his starting point.
The coup government wanted M. To "abdicate" Zelaya and ask for political asylum abroad.
The ousted president, however, declined to do so, as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcomed, incumbent head of state.
The coup regime "has suffered renewed failure by trying to persuade me to give up at my expense (...), they wanted me to abdicate," M said on Thursday. Zelaya to Radio Globo, in which he has frequently spoken to Radio Globo since the beginning of the political crisis, which has already lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here well and gladly ten years, here I have my guitar, added the ousted president, who had taken refuge in the Brazilian Embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with attacks some chords.
The Mexican Embassy has submitted to us a request for escort, which we unfortunately cannot accept, since it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, interior minister of the coup government, had declared on Wednesday to the Honduran radio HRN.
I do not ask for asylum at all in any country, Manuel Zelaya had replied in an interview with the channel Telesur, whose headquarters are in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had underlined, would only make as president of the Honduran people.
The rumours of an exit M. Zelayas had on Wednesday mobilized the supporters of the ousted president, who had set out for the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, after which the military had stepped up its deployment.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticised the coup government's position.
This, according to his assessment, reveals the marginal nature of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached Socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was on the 28th. June, on the day of the referendum he organized in preparation for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress, was overthrown.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he was on 21. Returned surprisingly in September and had taken refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves these, he will be detained for high treason, which he is accused by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coup president Roberto Micheletti has succeeded in a presidential election on 29. November to organize to M. Replace Zelaya.
Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States in the course of the disputed election, but rejected by the Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Congress had massively opposed M. Zelaya's return to office until the expiration of his mandate on 27. January voted.

The New York Stock Exchange closed Thursday with a high, the figures in the American trade balance testify to a price recovery of the shares of the United States as well as its partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
According to the figures at the close of the stock exchange, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, the Nasdaq, in turn, dominated by technology, from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor ́s 500 was posted at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, judged Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally under the premise that the market is merely focusing on "half-full glasses," she moderated.
According to Avalon Partners' Peter Cardillo, investors are mainly fixated on the figures on the American trade balance, "which has an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter."
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October relative to September.
Analysts, by contrast, had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average for new job seekers had "fallen to the low point of the year" during the last four weeks, Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors stressed.
The bond market has fallen.
Government bond profitability has risen to 3.482% from Tuesday night, while bond profitability has risen to 3.482% from Tuesday evening, while bond profitability to 30 years to 4.492% from the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power whistle out "Ladies in White"
A few hundred partisans in Cuban power on Thursday whistled out the wives of political prisoners who came together in Havana for the purpose of the World Human Rights Day and also thwarted another rally, on the basis of which a good dozen dissidents were temporarily arrested.
Around the forty "ladies in white", wives or close-to-sighted political prisoners, were whistled on the open street by partisans of the government under Raul Castro, just as they were on the foot march to the center of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, a journalist confirmed to AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Mercenaries!", "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Living Fidel and Raul!" the empowered partisans chanted with their fists raised to the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civil agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection."
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place the night before in Havana, in which there were neither injured nor arrests.
In the Havannese district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents, who also set out for the demonstration on Thursday in the face of the International Human Rights Day, were temporarily arrested by plainclothes police, a reporter confirmed to the AFP.
According to this journalist, the police have forced the dissidents booed by the partisans of the government under the use of force in civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to only a few hours.
As contenders for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unauthorised march for the purpose of "requesting the release of all political prisoners," the number of which according to the list of dissidents has around 200 people, explained Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a prison sentence of 20 years.
M. Maceda is among the group of 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, 53 of whom are currently behind bars.
The Cuban authorities perceive the regime opponents as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
One rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on Thursday's demonstration events between militant pro-government fighters and "contra-revolutionaries."
Cuba, led by a Unity Party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of vilification of rights and freedoms, especially that of freedom of expression.
Madman kills eighty-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A madman armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old and injured five other people on Friday towards the main business hour in downtown Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine).
According to the first data of the questioning, the 28-year-old attacker had injured the eighty-year-old for a previously unexplained cause in or in front of a pharmacy on the Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police information, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, has succumbed to the consequences of his injuries, according to a person in charge of the police syndicate Alliance in hospital.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he pre-buttoned a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in the threesomes, has intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were hospitalized seriously injured, where the eighty-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of life, as he, according to police sources, apparently vital organs were affected.
The pregnant woman has become nauseous as a result of the events and, according to a police source, she is said to have been hospitalized in "shock condition".
The armed man, who according to the police seemed to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped into the street, the equal boulevard of Jean Jaure.
He would have injured two other passers-by, apparently by chance: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of both severely.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two butcher's knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, explained on the spot Arnaud Pressé, a person in charge of the Syndicate Alliance of the Hauts-de-Seine area.
Several passers-by, including youths, are said to have tried to tame the madman, according to the witness reports determined by the AFP.
I've seen a guy in the thirties with a green vest.
Three young people tried to intervene.
They didn't make it because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter of a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen over him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist in the process.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of house number 61, two city police officers, including their supervisor, have tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with stabbings, according to police information.
The action has taken place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by approached me to tell me there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put her in first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person has come, injured by cuts.
Emergency personnel from the state police have finally arrested the man, who was not carrying any identification papers.
The prosecutor’s office of Nanterre has commissioned the district department of the criminal police of Hauts-de Seine (SDPJ 92) with the case investigation.
The maniac was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been heard in court.
A police source does not rule out him being admitted to a mental hospital.
According to another police source, it smelled six police officers to tame him at the police commissioner's office in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitation" such as "all the spiritually confused of this kind, in which the forces are released during the course of the crime".
US: Polanski's lawyer calls for re-enactment cessation
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, Western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of the "pianist," has denounced gross litigation errors in the trial in 1977 before three judges of the Court of Appeal in the second district of California.
I'm calling for a penalty on the spot, M. Hummel, before adding that the conduct of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was tasked with the case at the time of the trial, "let it run coldly down your back."
According to him, the - now deceased - Judge Rittenband, before he dropped his judge's verdict, had discussed with a prosecutor, who is said to have told him that Roman Polanski had earned prison -- which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion had been raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", especially by the questioning prosecutor David Wells.
M. Wells had finally declared at the end of September that he had "lied" to the authors of the documentary.
Should the Court refuse to close the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel will require the conduct of a trial that would allow him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the abrogation of the facts charged to the accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the US in 1978, even before the sentence was announced for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He has not traveled to the United States since that time.
Los Angeles County Deputy Attorney General Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to attend the trial."
Would one like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, the escape is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayma.
In her opinion, the filmmaker "asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority."
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even emphasized that “there are other escape alternatives.”
Hummel was not the only one who had requested the cessation of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the lifting of the criminal proceedings once again.
She recalled that her client would no longer bear to be harassed by any resurgence of the Affaire Polanski, adding: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was on the 26th September in Switzerland, arrested at the request of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of an eventual extradition.
Wall Street is being sloted by the dollar's rise and is closing out without a price.
The New York Stock Exchange closed Friday without a price, in a market that was torn between better indicators than those envisaged in the U.S. and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closure, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq has dropped 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index has risen 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
"Honestly, the market is pretty quiet," Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management noted.
“It remains narrowly limited, the trading volume has become very low and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year.”
The trend was supported by the publication of better economic indicators than envisaged, which "helped to improve the market view to the solidity of the economy's resurgence," Charles Schwab's analysts summarized.
In the U.S., retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than expected.
Furthermore, confidence among American consumers improved significantly in December, to 73.4 compared to 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's index preview.
However, the indexes have been slowed by a new rise in the dollar price, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, pushing down ''the sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," explained Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost some ground as a result.
The bond market has declined.
The yield on the Treasury bond over 10 years rose by 3.540% on Wednesday evening compared to 3.482% and that of the bond over 30 years to 4.497%, compared with 4.492% the previous day.
Miss World election in South Africa again
After a month of round trip through South Africa, the 112 female candidates for the title of Miss World on Saturday will cross the last hurdle to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and this in front of a billion television viewers.
During this great beauty fair, which is being held for the second year in a row in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a true whirlpool of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply exceptional.
I've seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!," Miss Sierra Leone said with full enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live on Saturday, starting at 5pm (15pm Central European time) from Midrand, north of Johannesburg.
I couldn't imagine a better country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian woman, her second stay in South Africa was characterized by numerous exchanges of experience with female candidates and the rediscovery of "breathtaking landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, encounters with the press and safari, the Miss are now focusing on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman's dream to be crowned once as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about the look.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this will be 59. Edition with music and dance underlined.
The candidates defile in traditional costumes and not to forget, in a swimsuit.
The performance is presented by a television presenter, the Chinese Angela Chow, by the ex-beauty queen from South Africa, Michelle McLean, and by a supervisor of the Miss World committee, Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to receive the world with a hardly surpassable warmth and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairwoman of the Miss World.
The candidates, like last year, did a safari, visited the famous township in Soweto, but this time tasted by bike and local cuisine.
Quite extraordinary, however, was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them the hand.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, remains undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (Southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way of promoting this event a little more.
I'm dealing with people I probably never could approach.
I will certainly come back to the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastically promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news on Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," according to his son David
The news on Johnny Hallyday is "very positive," his son David assured on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday explained to the press on the exit from the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 13 o'clock local time (21 o'clock CET) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would "quickly" go to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital, to which Johnny Hallyday on Monday because of a bacterial follow-up infection after surgery on a herniated disc on the 26th. was delivered to Paris in November.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma this night in Los Angeles to relieve his severe pain and be able to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday has been put into an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles, into which he was on Monday for a bacterial follow-up infection following herniated disc surgery on 26. was delivered to Paris in November.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night from Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife, Laeticia, attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade is going to school, a photographer told AFP.
The chief of the department of orthopaedic and traumatological surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer at the hospital in Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer has the neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who won the singer on the 26th. November at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris operated, heavily burdened.
We were told that he had done the purest massacre.
The Los Angeles surgeons said they were completely indignant, Mr Camus explained.
I've heard that you'll possibly initiate legal proceedings, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus is of the opinion that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles far too quickly and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon."
I spoke to this doctor in person, who assured me that he considers this trip to be completely unproblematic, which had surprised me very much, since I myself already have two disc operations behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced to RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything."
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist milieu.
He had operated on actress Marie Trintignant, a few days before her death in Vilnius, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times for failed operations and not to forget, for tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Association, has described him as "a man without scruple" who has "regular" responsibility in front of the board of directors and is "anything but recommended."
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
This one explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative investigations would have been "normal."
The operation "did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been on since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is clear that it is obvious that it will be for a continuation of the tour on the 8. January (in Amiens) is a little too scarce, Mr Camus explained.
The party alliance UDF (Union for French Democracy) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is overseen by François Bayrou’s MoDem party, on Friday reacted violently to a takeover attempt of the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d’Estaing, on the part of the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him to stop using this seal on a document under threat of a judicial prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to adopt this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after he had handed the left the hand.
The defense minister, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In order to reprint his efforts, he had received the support of Mr Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who is entitled to the property of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this trade mark in 2004 at the Institut national de la propriété industrielle.
However, the office of the party alliance UDF, supervised by François Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and set a deadline for the Minister and the Member of Parliament, under threat of judicial prosecution, no longer to use this seal and to transfer the property rights of the brand to it.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to +acquire+ the UDF seal, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 office members, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and the Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement printed +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today's UDF+, on their political material, as well as on the home page of your website.
As you know, you are not entitled to the use of this seal, the office of the UDF explained, and calls on the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name UDF from all material as well as from (its) website."
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the property rights of the trademark to its legal beneficiaries."
If you refuse to do so, we will bring an action against you to exercise respect to the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF "has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and reminds that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave this in 2007 to form a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002, to found the party "UMP."
The Nouveau centre party therefore has no right whatsoever to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie française).
They further recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 passed the three-year accession to the MoDem party, as well as the establishment of an office in defense of "the material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, "at the time he applied for the brand name, he was no longer a member of the UDF" but of the UMP for three years.
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way, from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF to carry this out for himself.
Furthermore, you consider that this recklessness is well on its way to turning into a crime, and ironize the strategy of the NC: "It seems more dignified to us in politics as well as in life to make a name for ourselves, instead of trying to get out of anonymity by, in a fraudulent way, to acquire a name to which you have no legal claims whatsoever."
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting weakness
The Nanterre Court on Friday decided to judge the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to sneak up part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, who is known for his star photos, will turn out on 15 and 16. April 2010 must be held responsible for exploiting weakness in court, a criminal offence punishable by a maximum of three years imprisonment and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair, worthy of the saga of one of France's richest families, in which mother and daughter rup and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in hand.
Likewise, however, the 15th ordered. Criminal chamber a medical examination of the 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to undergo such an investigation, especially under the conditions presented during the investigation by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office.
Doctors appointed on Friday are due to attend before the 10th. March 2010 present a report in which you clearly announce whether and at what time Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will undergo these investigations.
I will speak to her, Ms. Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, explained after the trial.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the court's decision.
This is excellent news (...). The report will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady, who must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has launched a criminal lawsuit against François-Marie Banier, photographer and all-round artist, and has accused him of taking advantage of her mother's weakness for years to steal donations of a total of one billion euros in the form of bank cheques, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always refuted being manipulated by the photographer, whom she regards as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to consider the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the plaidoyers of the lawyers on Friday led to a major family debacle.
Thus, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer has invoked three letters sent to her notary by his client (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusts the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added the following: "You could please explain to my daughter that I have written to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Françoise since her marriage.”
The prosecutor's office of Nanterre is once again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially because a guardianship judge in recent days has rejected her request to initiate judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legally capable, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," said Marie-Christine Daubigney, a representative of the public prosecutor's office.
The court has now decided to give a verdict after the trial for the admissibility of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager revolution or the end of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of managing large companies in relation to its employees, the position of the companies vis-à-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution said: it is intended for the staff to "values" determine the best, as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians at the plant.
By putting the customer at the center of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose separate factors factors of customers again regularly!
Demobilization of employees can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that touches the employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&E and, which is even more important, on those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE ( Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) demands "from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking view"; it claims from the employees a commitment to which the instructions of the authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for a company revolution that would consist of placing employees at the centre of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very conditional benefit of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid, unfortunately, not.
- First of all, because I was able to find that, in the face of a new situation, after a lot of detours, the whole structure finally comes to doing primarily what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases proportionally to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a highly simplified idea of human behavior.
The result of the great engineering schools is their interpretation of psychology mechanistic.
They adopt through intellectual comfort the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the U.S. "neurosciences" and unknowingly spread extensively by research institutes and through the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to operate the "leverage" (sic) to the commitment of employees, a recent Le Figaro.fr survey of Ipsos encourages executives in an attitude to a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises requires the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists of integrating a basic protocol into any consideration or practice of governance: for wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambition and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this concept of motivation of the employees.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predetermined doxa, which, through their perceived image of the company, allows them to estimate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the executives of the companies can control, predict and anticipate their "social performance" and place their human resource management back in the right place.
Thus, they create a fertile ground that is favorable for the coordinated development of robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo's speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American right on Friday welcomed the speech delivered by Barack Obama in Oslo the night before and was satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who awarded the award of the prize to Obama on the 9th. October had mocked, this time applauded the speech of the president, following the example of the former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 elections Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the daily USA Today, adding that she herself had raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her just published memoir.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, the two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush inherited the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, made an effort in Oslo on Thursday to justify the use of force; a way of declaring his decision from nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, argued that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives rejoiced, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts, I found this speech to be entirely historic, explained Ginrich, who was questioned on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The previous lawmaker, who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to have seen a "president of the left" who reminded members of the Nobel committee that they "were not free and could not hand out a prize for peace if the use of violence did not exist."
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush, and now editor at The Washington Post, Obama has given "a very American speech."
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan," as "he always does," he "spoke like an American president" when he pointed out that Europeans "live like in a security bubble they didn't create themselves and for whose protection they don't do much," according to Gerson.
Among the few, unfaithful right-wingers, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, described the speech on the National Review Online website as "boring, high-floor and inspirationless."
To the left of the president, the Democratic representative Dennis Kucinich is worried about how Barack Obama defends the resorting to the armed forces.
If you package the war under the guise of justice, the massacre of the innocent can be justified quite simply, he warns.
However, the press of the moderate left remains praiseworthy alongside the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, referred to the address itself to a speaker like him, who is known for his talent, as a "monumental work."
The speech in Oslo "provides a schedule to govern international decisions against the conflicts, poverty and oppression," according to the California daily enthusiastically.
The New York Times believes that Obama "proclaimed the necessary discourse" and describes his speech as "gloomy and exemplary at the same time."
Long-distance driver: Three marathons for a deal that secures supply at Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organisation that remained until the end - came to an agreement on Friday night that puts an end to the strike order and the looming severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signature meeting on Friday evening, the Secretary of State responsible for transport, Dominique Bussereau, "welcomed" the agreement, which was initiated on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted ways early on Friday morning in the hope of quickly signing the agreement in the late morning.
This is despite the fact that the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement and it was not until 18:00 that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have done a great deal of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," according to Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from 8.72 euros to 9.06 euros.
"That's not very much, but we'll start small," says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now being instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some recalcitrations who are not satisfied with the settlement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot spoke of a "good agreement," although it was "difficult to concede these wage increases in the face of international competition."
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic settlement."
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said in this regard about "an acceptable compromise."
The agreement also provides for the 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the overall road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will in particular make it possible to make it possible to make the issue 13. to address monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
M. Bussereau recalled that "the fall in levies for employers amounting to 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the draft law of corrected finances for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for "an identical" vote from the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply first to the undertakings affiliated to this organisation and that it subsequently applies to the entire profession in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in a very short time," Bussereau assures.
The opposition of employers' associations can only delay the proceedings.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to compensate for a part of the carbon tax."
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but not to spoil the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, the Unostra laments.
For the Otre association, the agreement threatens to "dig a large grave to the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the coming 12 months."
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions unhappy with the RATP's proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, the largest high-speed rail network in France for the greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a gathering on Friday, the 2. Strike day between the trade unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Paris Passenger Transport Administration), which lets strikers continue to wait with their demands for wage surcharges.
There were no trains running between 10:00 and 20:00 on this important shopping weekend before Christmas. On the central line (between La Défense and the nation) only one in two trains was ready for use and only one of four trains outside the central line.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the passengers to change trains.
Department store chain Galeries Lafayette, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is trying to connect the big stores in terms of transport."
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains was scheduled to run at rush hour, and almost none during the low-traffic period.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the residents of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), explained that he would have got up extra "an hour and a half earlier to get to work on time."
The SNCF, which had planned to look after the travellers by staff and police, pointed out that there had been no shortages at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line or in the direction of Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via the Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the strikers' general meetings were held again, during which the results, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the senior management on Friday afternoon, were reviewed.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific drafting of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
However, that is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they are demanding a long-due wage surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself puts its wage surcharge proposals in brackets and stressed that the senior leadership "is not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF."
The RATP clarified that a reunion was scheduled for the "comprehensive examination of working conditions" for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company "ignores the weekend drivers."
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the branch of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership that has so far rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a gathering after a calming of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to the RER B line following an advance notice from Unsa and Indépendants.
The associations demand a wage surcharge of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they bemoan the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers travel every day.
The drivers of the RER line, who have years of professional experience, receive a gross wage of 2,200 to 2,700 euros as well as a wage surcharge of 600 to 650 euros for shift services as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country's pro-Kurdish main party; a decision that immediately followed angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously more difficult, which strives to shake hands with the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have been going on for 25 years.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," according to the President of the Constitutional Court, Hasim Kiliç, four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kiliç, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution. He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political events for a period of five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the waiver of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's goods.
The DTP now has 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders expressed themselves before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than meet like non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed proceedings initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court of Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya. He accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and numerous other countries consider a terrorist organization.
Numerous observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling of the Constitutional Court radios the government in between, which strives to accommodate the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, in order to allow the support of the PKK by the Kurds to dry up and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a recurrence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of PKK chief Abdullah Öcalan had led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the court's announcement, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP's premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is overwhelmingly populated by Kurds.
The law enforcement forces set in tear gas grenades and water cannons as protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk assumed that the court's decision will "deepen the despair even further."
“Turkey can do this (Kurdish, d. editorial) Do not clarify question on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he explained to the press.
The government, made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
“We oppose, on principle, against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of democratic opening, which has been promoted by the government," according to political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"You can obviously be prepared for a reaction from the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK confessed to an attack in which seven soldiers died in northern Turkey three days earlier. This was one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall can come
A really crisp winter, that’s what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully the citizens, says the winter service manager of the FES.
But so that its employees can try out the entire vehicle technology and learn to master.
This weekend, according to meteorologists, it could be the first time.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are on standby to take care of snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
As soon as it snows nationwide in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-lines are driven off with large-scale scattering vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include, for example, main roads and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstraße.
But also fire brigade access roads, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with gradients, such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The service of the FES begins at three in the morning
If necessary, the approximately 1040 kilometers would have to be sprinkled in a maximum of three hours with wet salt, which adheres better.
That's why the FES starts at three o'clock at night, "so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts".
It will be difficult if it snows at 7.30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is willing to make way for the scattering vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow further, are it turn to feeder and access roads, including the Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is side and side streets.
There will be complaints there, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES set off, danger points and crossings are primarily cleared.
The FES usually cannot take care of all cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 p.m., says Brauburger.
Since there is smoothness on this quickly, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, this will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: the two-metre-long and 1.50-metre-tall animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws and a long tail.
Had the species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
Yet Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, report Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the Pangea supercontinent at the equator.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
He shows us a lot about the kinship, the spread and features of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating the Ghost Ranch in northern Mexico.
We have sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Triassic, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they gathered the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about dino early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it's an extraordinary find: "Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually you only find single fragments."
Other dinosaur experts don't necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This find is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of the dinosaurs, says Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
According to the current doctrine, the dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these primal dinos is usually controversial.
For example, the experts debate when the lizards split into their three most important lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the Velociraptor and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long-necked" and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithischia (bird basin saura), for example, to which
After analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
He has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air bags, such as those possessed by the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the air bags, the breathing of the birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of the giant sauropods later also had air bags and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three migration waves to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs so far lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
Accordingly, the three development lines separated early on and spread from South America over all the continents, which at that time still formed a single land mass as a supercontinent of Pangea.
This is evidenced by the fact that the team, together with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot descend from a common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the Science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could result, because in South America especially many primitive dino fossils have simply been preserved, while on other continents hardly anything is to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to develop from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile strain to the dominant land vertebrates of the Earth's Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, for example with the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying dinosaurs and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, the dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the kinship on the border from the Triassic to the Jurassic died out.
Success story didn't last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There may have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs survived by chance, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so they could knock the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact of a group of animals helped to flower, which had also developed in the Triassic and since then a shadowy existence: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto stand on it, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are there, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of Frankfurt Goethe University is making waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, are in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police operation initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and lecturers on educational strike cleared in the past week because walls and artworks had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, the signatories judge, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command."
The eviction represents an "unacceptable intervention" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the deligitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has evaded the necessary discourse.
The lecturers are calling for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the squatters did not support the damage to property, it said.
Protest legitimized
The youth of the trade union Verdi and the German Trade Union Confederation are also in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for one's own future, says Verdi's state youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hesse’s Minister of Science Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the university president and the police.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are completely unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We understand the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, according to CDU state parliament member Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions SPD, Greens and Left parties saw it differently.
The CDU takes painted walls to the pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they have been cleared.
The left has tabled a motion calling on the Home Secretary to give a report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital Moscow, was a closely guarded location for secret arms research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216 000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production facilities for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograd had established contacts with the Frankfurt science location Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Center (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday now Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol for closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Vice-Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt, Planning Secretary Edwin Schwarz signed.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized companies of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchange
This is about continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
Companies of the FIZ are made possible to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electron Technology, the large corporations Sitronics and Rosssijskaya Elektronika.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape where the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgart brake pad
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the proponents of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than lowering a train station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the state capital of Baden-Württemberg into wholesome construction site chaos for a decade.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were considered traffic fossils of the 19. Century that acted like brake pads of modern rail transport, as it once took an enormous amount of time to encircle locomotives from the back to the front.
Drive in, keep for a moment, continue driving - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that's why the head stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station that is about halfway down the trans-European rail magistral between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the "heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being tackled, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have recognized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian cities to implement the lowering.
However, head stations no longer have an entry and exit problem since there are modern turning trains with train vehicles and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless: Stuttgart 21 next to the ICE new construction line to Ulm is now being tackled.
State and local politicians have enforced it.
The railway participates, also because the risks of the largest infrastructure single project of the Republic of taxpayers and not the state corporation bears.
In terms of urban planning, the project can still be reasonably justified.
New urban space is created, which - believes the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The through station and the extension of the route are intended for passenger traffic, to which - typical 80s - huge growth was attributed.
At that time, there was not yet the competition of low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first be about strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is considerably more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new line is not suitable for freight trains due to heavy gradients.
What is even more serious is that S21 indirectly also affects many other rail projects.
A good six billion euros are to be buried in Swabian.
That's the official number.
Experts think ten to 15 billion are realistic.
One thing is certain, in the next decade, the money will be missing at other hubs and bottlenecks on the net.
A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the expansion of the 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the route has been built at slow motion.
It would be urgent to press correctly on the tube.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley line becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: in the heart of Europe.
Government probes ruling on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will go against the ruling of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban in appeal.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400 pages comprehensive VGH judgment legally examined, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had justified in writing on this day that the country had to re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned northwest runway in Frankfurt Airport.
The approval of 17 flights between 23 and 5 o’clock, as provided for by the state government, is not to be agreed with the legally required protection of the population from nighttime aircraft noise.
The coalition must go to 4. January will decide whether to go against the verdict in revision.
The opposition criticized this postponement and invaded the representatives of the government to waive a revision at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD parliamentary leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban. Otherwise, this should be considered a "wordbreaking".
It's damn hard to keep your word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir in reference to the FDP election slogan "We keep word."
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to get with "right-wing twisting and trickery" still to their night flights.
A close legal examination needs their time.
The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of a "quick first impression."
We need a legally compliant decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
As the opposition portrayed, the statements of his faction on the night flight ban were never.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-hit U.S. big banks are stripping off their state shackles.
The Bank of America on Wednesday repaid aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp totalling $45 billion (a good €30 billion) in one fell swoop.
And Citigroup also plans to reimburse state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have come with the acceptance of the money – for example, the limitation in the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised a good $19 billion in fresh money from investors via convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum she took from her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by divisional sales.
Bank CEO Kenneth Lewis explicitly thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: The cash injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had stood out at the height of the financial crisis with the takeover of investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to raise money on the capital market to free its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly $20 billion increase in its capital, CNBC reported, citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesman declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick choice
It all went faster than I thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had forced the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the panel wanted to vote on the staffing.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF capital studio in Berlin, was considered the favourite.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster for this - officially, so as not to prejudge the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role not to further damage the ZDF director Markus Schächter, should this proposal also not come through with the Board of Directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote was not yet determined at the editorial deadline of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had failed with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years on the board of directors.
Only seven members spoke out in favour of Brender, seven voted against him. Brender's deselection was a bitter defeat for Schächter, but an expectable one.
Because the Union majority in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
The resistance against the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender, the ZDF's news broadcasts had lost ratings, he rejected another term of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was scourged.
Most recently, even 35 state lawyers had interfered in the debate, which assessed Koch’s actions as unconstitutional.
It was of no use.
To the person
Peter Frey was on 4. Born in Bingen in August 1957.
He studied politics, pedagogy and Romance studies.
After that, he worked at Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, initially to the "heute-journal".
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF capital studio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the deselection of Brender, who was still elected journalist of the year by the industry journal Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch's counterpart on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared last week that the countries should change the ZDF state treaty in such a way that personnel proposals of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an excerpt of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's expected successor Peter Frey had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by strongly criticizing the panel for it immediately after the Brender deselection.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, both Schächter without loss of face could nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief and the Board of Directors elected without suspecting that he would bring a party-goer into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is attributed to the left-liberals anyway.
Study is decluttered
Partial success for the students: After a year of educational strike, the culture ministers of the countries finally intervened on Thursday: At a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Education and Higher Education Rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions in the Bachelor and Master.
The students should be able to cope with their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the exam loads: In principle, each study module should only be completed with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to make common structural requirements for bachelor's and master's degree programs more flexible.
In addition, there should be no deviating country regulations.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university rectors have been wearing the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now it has been filled with a concrete content for the first time.
The so-called accreditation council decided to reduce the number of exams in part drastically: "Each module usually concludes with only one exam," according to a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree programs.
With the "significant reduction of the burden of examinations," explained the Accreditation Council Chairman Reinhold Grimm, a "misdevelopment should be stopped, which significantly impaired the studyability."
In addition, "studyability" should be "the decisive criterion" in the design in the future.
Modules such as content should be "strictly checked" whether "unnecessary classifications of the students in the choice of
events" would be avoided.
The students would have "claim to preserve scope, enable and promote initiative."
The rules should apply when admitting new, but also when reviewing existing degree programs.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years - which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all study programmes to be reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies are responsible for this nationwide, which are subject to the accreditation council established by the countries.
The ministers of culture had urged the countries in October "forcefully" to act on the agencies in such a way that the abundance of substances is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In individual federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed on appropriate measures with the state ministries.
Rhineland-Palatinate was the only country to offer additional resources for the further development of the Bologna process.
From the money, the universities are primarily to set up tutoring programs and strengthen study advice as well as examination and foreign offices.
The state and universities want to spend tens of millions of euros on this.
In early 2010, the government wants to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act in Parliament.
According to this, only a single examination should be necessary for the completion of a study model.
The design of studies should become more flexible, in addition, the recognition of certificates at other universities is to be guaranteed and access to the master's degree is to be facilitated.
By the end of next year, all study programs in the country are to be checked for their studyability.
The government and opposition had argued again on Thursday about the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors in the future.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also "have a say" as those affected.
The future academics received support from the president of the Higher Education Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the students' experiences," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK advised on a joint reform paper.
The Bonn decisions did not go far enough for the Education and Science Union (GEW): it calls for a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree.
On the other hand, the countries must ensure that there are sufficient master's degree places with the best possible study conditions for today's generation of bachelor's students tomorrow, according to GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire significantly more lecturers.
However, the ministers of culture did not comment on a freer access to the master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
Entering Germany and out is almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he addresses the arrival experience of a dissident who gained freedom but at the same time lost his language space in disturbing language scraps.
Born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, Werner Söllner had worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children's book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he held the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
Last Tuesday, he caused a considerable extra-literary stir during a conference in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and distorted mirror of its secretive acts".
Visibly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he wrote to Romanian-German writer colleagues, among others. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, who admitted his work as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, Söllner had received the German Language Award in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have begun gradually, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner concluded, "so someone who has not resisted intimidation attempts by the Securitate enough."
The poet Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary examination of the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that identifies the abysses and the loathsomeness of a political system based on surveillance and spying.
Werner Söllner is, as far as one can say according to previous knowledge, not only perpetrator, but also a victim.
In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a role, said after Söllner’s confession, the literary scholar Michael Markel, and referred to the positive influence of the IM Walter for him.
He had "blew him out" in all the points that were difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
He is a moral need to make this remark.
Söllner’s explanation was unexpected in the form and in front of this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not surprising.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for Securitate-Spitzel, had already written Herta Müller in July in the time, after she had read her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, one may suspect, are speculated and in some cases probably also known which clear name was hidden behind the alias Sorin, Voicu and Walter.
In contrast to the now very procedural inspection of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacy of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
A systematic enlightenment has been backed by and hindered in recent years.
A National Council for the Reappraisal of the Securitate Acts (CNSAS) in accordance with the Birthler Authority was only established in 1999, but the publication of the files has been rather slow ever since.
Only since 2005 has there been a law that regulates the administration of the files.
The fact that the influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very large was evidenced by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate boss from Temesvar expressed derogatory comments about the laureate.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power meant to be able to express itself here quite blatantly in the form of freedom of expression.
Certainly, the case of Söllner, as is so often the case in connection with secret guilt, is subject to inevitable questions.
Why only now? Who was harmed? The calm reaction of the listeners to Söllner’s confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the urge to know rather than to blame and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturation supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there was just a dressed field worker coming from a very nice Christmas party, at which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the supplier, climbed into a summoned C-Class a quarter of an hour after midnight. ̈
The man with the striking baldness was chauffeured because of the city still foreign to him.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - alcohol was not in the game after all, and drunk with luck, the 55-year-old was just as little.
Had been a pleasant evening, but morning the work continues.
Or just really going on.
In the words of the Swiss, who was only committed three days earlier: "We have indeed reached the quarter-finals", namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally tough fight against relegation."
The "much more important task" is imminent on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the premier class performance in the league everyday life in Mainz.
And to put off the weaknesses revealed again after the fast three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Draw
The Champions League quarter-finals (first leg 16./17. + 23/24 February/ Return leg 9/10. + 16./17. March) will be on 18. December draw in Nyon.
The joy of the brilliant debut of the Babbel successor remained subdued.
Not only with the supposed bringer of salvation, who had conveyed the insecure Stuttgart professionals in the short time self-confidence, commitment and joy of playing.
I approached the players and told them to remember their strengths, and have urged them to be more courageous, explained shrink Gross the simple-sounding recipe for success, which had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has sparked some magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn't have thought possible."
And Sami Khedira, who became the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury break thanks to his momentum, tried to describe the identified "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working the new supervisor: "He is a man who reaches through and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, it had obviously been lacking.
VfB Stuttgart is not yet over the mountain, warns sports board member Horst Heldt
However, VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all else.
Like Gross, players and managers were wary of overvaluing the victory against a weakened and completely overwhelmed defense of the Romanian guests.
They had also won in Glasgow, before four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the bad awakening came, Khedira said.
And sporting director Horst Heldt warned that although one season goal has been achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
That Heldt at his 40th. Birthday even after the first home win in three months was not after celebrating, was due to the events of the weekend, which revived in the form of a television interview broadcast immediately before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and decided to change coaches on pressure of pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered that his day off after games had been cancelled as a sign of a lack of sovereignty and disfavor.
Lehmann's statements were "shaped by pure selfishness," Heldt wedged back and announced consequences for the final man.
They probably won't be friends for life anymore, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, however, they agreed with everyone else that without the preparatory work by the detached coaching team, the playfully and combatively strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a big share in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said in unison - and the man with the plastic bag, too, agreed.
Heavyweight World Cup fight
Heated duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title by version of the WBC.
The judgment of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains boxing world heavyweight champion.
The 38-year-old champion, according to the version of the association WBC, defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously after points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on the night of Saturday in Bern.
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian has twice been world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, it didn't work out with the knockout that everyone was expecting.
Klitschko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to admit defeat due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to score in the 24th. Fight the first defeat.
In front of around 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02-metre-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight, especially with his left-wing leadership hand.
The eleven-centimeter-smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but repeatedly escaped the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who has gone with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve rounds.
The challenger had caused some stir before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He insulted Klitschko as an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right."
While weighing, the champion then let himself be provoked on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to be able to see his eyes."
Fourth win after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his comeback on the 11th. October 2008 victorious.
After almost four years of time out, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and reclaimed "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez from Cuba and in September Chris Arreola from the USA in his title defenses.
I only got one stroke in this fight and am physically very good in form, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations.
The belt of the WBA, however, is worn by the Briton David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13-meter Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had earlier cancelled a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September in the summer.
His promotion company is now planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Kunduz case
Frontal attack from the opposition: Greens parliamentary leader Jürgen Trittin has described Defense Minister Guttenberg as a liar because of false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left are calling for clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the air strike by Kunduz, the opposition has accused Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of a deliberate deception.
The minister had to the deadly bombardment on two tanker trucks from September "knowingly the falsehood," said Greens parliamentary group leader Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news program "Tagesschau".
This is commonly called: he lied.
The order to kill was issued in defiance of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That's the substance of the report that NATO had that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about a destruction of the kidnapped vices, but also about killing two Taliban leaders in a targeted manner.
The U.S. airstrike requested by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein had killed or injured, according to the NATO investigation report.
Greens, SPD and Left Party on Saturday called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the German government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and Greens colleague Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm firmly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence specific deployments of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts about the ministry's presentation about the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert had also become loud.
According to information from the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenberg have correctly and completely informed about the background of the tanker truck attack.
Officially, it had said they had denied the existence of NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, from the environment of the two top officials, it was said that they had even pointed out to the Ministry of Defense several reports, including a two-page document of the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the facts, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung".
He has not yet received an answer, it is said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the committee of inquiry of the Bundestag, which wants to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dream Worlds
Some see pictures in an alert state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
The boundaries between imagination and reality are blurred not only in the case of the mentally ill and the drug rush.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything's fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are allowed to indulge in the wildest ideas and fantasy.
However, anyone who experiences dreamlike conditions in the wakefulness, sees and hears things that others do not see or hear, is usually considered crazy or drug addicted in the modern Western world, at least as a weirdo.
But such images and voices arise not only in the case of the mentally ill or in the drug rush.
Our imagination is to blame: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes ensure that the boundaries between dream, delusion and reality blur.
Dream-like changed waking consciousness states can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case delusion.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the new-age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic rapture states, psychosis and hallucinations can still be attributed to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the brain's neural messengers - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disturbed.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts very often occur during schizophrenic psychosis.
gravity has no power over him anymore
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of dream in the waking state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, stated in 1861 a "great similarity of the insainess with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all inconsistencies, delusions, sensual illusions of such".
It's autumn 2001 when Henning T. transforms into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky-colored.
Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats on the ceiling.
He senses a kick.
Behind him, winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted faces, teeth-snagging.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he senses the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices roar out of walls and radio.
He can no longer bear them, the voices that insult and insult him.
Henning T. tears two cables out of the stereo, knots them into a sling and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs a loudspeaker and puts the sling around his neck.
Jump.
The noose is loosening.
This is supposed to be a lesson to you, screaming the voices in drum-shattering choir, "go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today is Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one is 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, and he is also manic-depressive, he takes medication, for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest despair, he says.
The illusions are cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, in psychiatric clinics she is treated as the second most common condition after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outside world, they fall into an overexcited state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Particularly common is voice hearing - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not rare.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the action, everything has a meaning directed at it.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he is, much like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is usually not possible for them, the illusions are cruel reality, awakening excluded.
To have experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "but the sensual and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis is fundamentally preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real frame.
Why exactly our brain beats capriciousness, researchers still find puzzles.
States of emergency can lead to a temporary loss of the reality of every human being, says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that the genes are not the sole determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that the neuronal ripening of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a mystery how the disturbance of the neural system comes about, which also does not manifest itself at first for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger a psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brains are hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive medications to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get some, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether mirages are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of point of view.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and deceit for ten years, and last year he evaluated his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Head".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of amazingly many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, this often includes diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and traumatic brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory content that is usually withheld.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or inhibited; when our brains run hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition just as much as brain damage or psychosis.
But also stimulus withdrawal, stress, heartbreak or other mental states of emergency.
In recent studies, up to a third of respondents said they had experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If it weren't for the pictures and voices.
During the break, it can happen that a slug boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a spun daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy?, she sometimes wonders.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow the subject matter of instruction, because the teacher is just introducing a new classmate in her eyes and ears, while he explains mathematical equations for everyone else to hear and visible on the board.
At night, the appearances are mostly scary.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which is far too rare and far too late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees arise the faces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, in front of her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she yells at the figures.
Parents and friends don't tell them about it, they would think they're crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she made contact with the psychologist box on the Internet, she knows full well that she is not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art out of despair
If someone is socially isolated or suffers from stimulus withdrawal, they are most likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is then underwhelmed and provides for its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often she played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at 13 that the man she calls dad since she can remember is not her biological father.
Since the same brain areas are active in visual and acoustic hallucinations that also process real impressions and sounds, those affected, such as Sarah K., find it difficult to distinguish illusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "takes place in the brain, reality is reflected there.
Hallucinations are also images that create the brain, which is why they seem so real.”
Even nightly dream images considers Kasten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their deceits as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to value the hallucinations as a special ability.
The boundary between dream and hallucination
In our too much mind-centered world, imaginary experience is unfortunately mostly pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also harbors positive, creative things - madness is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of trauma-like changed waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer considers to be real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even in retrospect.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in trauma- or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by self- and world loss, for example by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own, imaginary world, which is decoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of boundary state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is presented in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning-making and meaning in an unbearable situation that allows us humans to develop their own ability not to perish in a nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart Change" as a rescue operation of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness travels for days after a heart valve operation with subsequent heart transplant, while his body in the intensive care unit is condemned to motionlessness.
Claussen immerses himself in a self-created world, visiting strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, aboard a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make intoxicants from blood.
If a Greek is carried away by a Greek on a motorcycle in his home country, surfs with his hospital bed in the firn snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He goes completely into the imagined event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream for Claussen.
Dream is a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental travel are still clear to me after years and in incidental details.
More clearly and more intensely even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychosis, hallucinations and drug frenzy show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in waking.
Any change in the state of consciousness, the psychologist caste concludes, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snowfall can come
Burda
Children to take over the publisher at the age of 27
The new head of publishing, Kallen, is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants to put his company in the hands of his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company is also expected to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future.
Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at 27 years old and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have settled the details of this as a precaution.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
The question of whether they are also capable of doing so.
You can't put 7500 employees in front of your children if they are not sufficiently empowered.
This will kill the children and the company too.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would retire from the chairmanship of the board from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
Initially, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury department, the responsibility for the company’s assets came to this and after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer also those for direct marketing, foreign, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the head of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The designation of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," according to Burda.
The holding company should continue to belong to 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda expressed that even family businesses are not safe from doom: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought that they could thus rise to the very big player.
My strategy was never that.
He had "never dreamed of world power," according to Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the World League with 'Time' either, these stores have become too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that’s what El Corte Inglés has set out to do, which recently opened a retail store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping centre in Callao (Madrid), which is all about body care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find other prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide a depilation with laser; spaxión, with rooms for relaxation and beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoying a relaxing massage together with your partner while having a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to get your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the many possibilities that Spaxión offers.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulite or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session with the entry of a personal password on a touchscreen that is opposite the devices.
After that, various videos show you how to perform your training sessions correctly.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) is perfectly sufficient to train the body muscles.
And if, after you have trained your body, you still want to stop by the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room where treatments for regaining hair, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open 365 days a year from 10:00 in the morning until 22:00.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that’s why it’s a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the dots that needs to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated cleavage. You can only advise against that.
Endesa and Barcelona with the electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" together with the city of Barcelona.
This is a project to develop and promote the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas concerned.
This is an attempt to advance the means of transportation of the future.
3 "electric cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three government-chosen cities in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
This framework agreement seeks to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include activities related to energy and, in particular, to their performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative that Endesa is taking part in with regard to the promotion of electric cars.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and has a whole range of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of calm' for the automotive sector
The government president, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, predicts "a horizon of calm" to the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's greatest exporter.
When presenting the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero recalled once again the measures that the government has launched in support of the automotive sector during the year of government.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the auto industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants today," the government president said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in a very competitive industry in Spain in the future, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided €800 million for projects by 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than €3 billion.
The head of government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to stimulate demand, in reference to Plan 2000E, which are applied in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the exhaust gases on new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "shaft increase" in registrations, which increased "by 40 percent" in November.
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classical Automobile Fair is held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.
This fair will be from 5 to 7. February 2010 take place in the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.

You can not only admire classic motorcycles and vehicles, but you will also find all imaginable articles in connection with the world of engines at ClassicAuto Madrid.
For example, exhibitors at the trade fair can find accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars, etc.
Hundreds of articles from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and lovers.
Among the companies that will participate in this fair include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, vehicle sales; Juan Lumbreras, restorations; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sales and restoration of automobiles, specializing in Mercedes Benz.
Skill tests in the outdoor area

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially set-up race track in the outer area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is quite compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the automatic stop and start-up system of the engine, christened i-Stop, the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good marks in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behavior, the mechanics, the i-Stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" on the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good support.
Furthermore, the play of the steering wheel is excellent.
When looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda is located with a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us of the style of the Honda Civics.
Therefore, it can be said without further ado that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially from the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers the appropriate comfort more than ever before, so that four adults can drive extremely comfortably.
To all this comes a large and clearly shaped trunk.
The stop and start-up system is only available for the 2-liter petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed gearshift.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its fineness, by its quiet noise, its performances and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in gearshifting and its low consumption, even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling.
In terms of equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The serial equipment is particularly evident in the assistant for lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the blind spot, but also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, light-sensitive interior mirrors, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking, independent air conditioning, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio Bluetooth, and the chrome-plated 17-inch.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not enough of equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, above all the learnable Bixenon headlights and the sound system BOSE with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, because of its handling and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative thing about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the model Luxury and 23,270 euros for the trial-savvy model Sportive.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us the highest driving fun every day.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L. A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine," the stars, dressed in models that look just as elegant as sexy, beamed more than ever. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe," as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that allows you to read only your e-mails without a way to see certain attachments or to surf the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is rather unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest, especially for young people.
Unlike the smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success with it, it has launched two new devices: one that is only intended for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free service for data, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel around the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to do without all the data to be able to read your emails once you have crossed the national border or when you are desperately looking for a café with a WIFI (or a connection option with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flat rate is incredibly seductive and should actually be possible for a long time.
It is true that some telephone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you already need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to be able to read all that fine print.
The repeated criticism by the European Commission regarding affordable roaming tariffs for the whole of Europe almost always went unheeded.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (although it is always amazing that it has the name Fon, even though it does not have Wifi/WLAN) can offer these types of tariffs means that the phone providers have to slowly but surely rethink and start to consider different ways they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, with its prices included downloading books and further inquiries on the Internet.
Without contract and without hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay once, namely when buying, not month after month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase opportunity with lifelong internet access like the Peek already offers in the USA.
And not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thanks.
But I expect this because I believe that it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The fetish color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American first lady.
Already when Barack Obama took office as President of the USA, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has re-elected the same color to accompany him at his, without a doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow - the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric-- and she wore something large-shaped embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far that at first sight it had the appearance that the first lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress at more than just one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and in Oslo one of patterned velvet.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-high heels and the second time a similar model, but gold-coloured.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was stuck up as a hair wreath on this occasion, in the previous one she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have had problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain" conducted by CSIC in cooperation with the Institute for Women's Affairs.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities in the labor market restricted due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and, if so, what kind of profession they practice.
Those of them who do not do any other activity outside the house, work only half-day or have no fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, the women with a permanent job, especially in the public sphere, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
“The women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a permanent job do not have their first child on average 3.7 years after contracting, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment, who have taken longer to achieve this and who have come to terms with her and the first child has only realized much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of willingness to conceive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference could also be noted among women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years of age, depending on whether they only have the primary school degree or a higher education, became a mother for the first time on average with 25.1 or 32.1 respectively.
Furthermore, depending on their level of education, there is another difference between women.
While the women with a main degree already get married before their first permanent employment and have their first child, the women with a middle or high school degree make it exactly the other way around and first look for a permanent job and get married afterwards and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is also worth it
L'Oréal Paris has recently added a new name to its ever-envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and also say the generally known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The lead actress from "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant actresses at an international level, will thus become another famous figurehead as before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spaniard Penélope Cruz.
Before her were the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
Among the men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Acting colleague of Evangeline in "Lost").
The awards ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important say in the fashion world.
Their highest representatives - fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today - met at the annual awards ceremony, which was held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
They had all appeared on the occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent presents in "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) to the three-strong X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, even in real life).
He does not use a predictable and terrifying genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vicent spares neither horror nor enlightenment.
Apart from the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
When reading his pages, I found out that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I have always felt, without having found words for it: joy in contrast to the ominous fate, morality without guilt and innocence without any God.
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was captivated by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in such a way that the flesh of which the emotions due to adultery combined with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege that consisted of coming to heaven on the detour of perish."
James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was published in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. This is one of the 8000s peaks in the world of literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall, on which the best mountaineers try again and again."
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny owl.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir to a landowner of the county and again other times he said that he was the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams testified to a certain greatness."
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer recorded the insane cry that was shouted out from a bridge by that personality from Munich, so that his echo might go deep into the night of 20. century echoed in its literary way. This he did on a journey on which he fled from himself and begged posterity to the worms with a speech full of violence.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and begged: my venerable God, I beg you to do everything in your power so that I finally stop writing like a woman."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses by Spencer: ' the sleep after the effort,/ after the thunderstorm of the port, / the rest after the war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage, she always had her depression with her.
The husband accepted it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII spied on her between the azaleas or sang the birds in Greek.
Not a single other case is known where the man was patient and was in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was still much greater than her madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martín-Santos do than try to instill Joyce in Baroja?
What did Benet intend to do if he did not introduce Baroja to Faulkner's weapons?
What did Cela do besides destroy that man’s glory so that he could put himself on this pedestal?”
Cowardly aggression
My 70-year-old mother was walking through our district in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 walked next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixed breed, which we have brought out of the shelter and which weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they gave him two footsteps and injured him with it severely.
Our indignation cannot be put into words, since it is incomprehensible to us where the fun should be in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course carried out on a leash.
In addition, there is the suffocation attack that a woman who was walking comfortably got when she wanted to rebuke these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a maniac attacks a dog, he will perhaps do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with anyone who is weaker than himself.
The incident happened in a normally quiet neighborhood at five in the afternoon on an ordinary Tuesday.
The dog cried all day long.
Of course, we have filed a complaint in a nearby police department, but we have great doubts whether this will bring anything and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we would only like to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spaniards.
Our indignation at what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must happen in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, company and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for the animals and the persons have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tire manufacturer Michelin, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote helmet use, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative thus seeks to draw attention to the importance of helmet use, since this is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "covers far more than just designing and manufacturing products that become increasingly safe with each passing day" and further reiterated that they also contribute with other actions of educational and informative character to get one step closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign to promote helmet use on the motorcycle, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in a first phase in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
To conclude, Michelin emphasized that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because, as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, they are always committed to the fact that one of its main goals must be the development of ever safer products.
The sale of small trucks is rising again somewhat
After almost two years, the car market for vans is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in terms of 2008, and, more importantly, they are thus the first increase ever after 22 consecutive months with a steady decline, according to the figures presented by the manufacturers’ association Anfac and the car dealer association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are currently only to be enjoyed with great caution, since the reference data used for comparison of November 2008 are, which was a particularly poor sales year with a 60% decrease in the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures for the previous financial year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but in this number all vehicles that make up the van market are included: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter small trucks/chassis.
Furthermore, the same storm clouds are still in the sky that most affect the demand, because even though some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
Thus, in addition to these restrictions, which are the result of the turned-down money tap of the credit institutions, one must include other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to passenger cars, the financial support has helped little in the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, but also the self-employed and small companies have a right to buy a van up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions that must not exceed 160 grams per kilometer driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday, Ganvam had reminded that it is absolutely necessary on the part of the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to the industrial vehicles (lorries and buses).
The car dealer association predicts a similar year for 2010 as the just past, for which it expects a sales failure (for passenger cars and SUVs) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the anti-lock braking system ABS and as is happening right now with the stability control ESP, the auxiliary systems for braking in emergencies must become a mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered passenger cars and light vans, for the remaining vehicles a waiting period has been set until the end of February 2011.
The aim of the measure adopted by the European Union is to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help to prevent many rear-end collisions because of their functioning.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical braking maneuver, which the system detects on the brake pedal on the basis of the braking strength executed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the very end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident no longer came to step on the brake pedal and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The braking aid, on the other hand, engages with maximum force in the braking system and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car travels during the braking process.
According to a study by the EU, up to 1,100 fatal accidents in which pedestrians are harmed could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assist.
There would be even fewer accidents - one expects that one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury - as soon as the so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (via radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time already exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him increase the pressure on the brake pedal if it becomes necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already inevitable, the brake assistant exerts the maximum pressure on the brakes in order to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europa, wants the party concerned to give its approval to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are works, will be postponed until early 2010.
GM is assured that it will make a decision regarding the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American carmaker so that it makes a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who would also like to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has backing from the Russian group Converg, is gaining increasing popularity.
If no agreement should be reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be upheld.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and really managed to make it 80 kilos lighter, which now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
In order to create such a thing, they were the first to dispense with the automatic folding roof, which was replaced by a tent screen roof with manual drive, so that alone you have saved 21 kilos; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3, another 15; by removing the air conditioning system another 13; in addition, the fuel tank has been reduced from 64 to 54 liters, so that the fuel tank was reduced from 64 to 54 liters;-inch rims again save five.
Then the abandonment of the CDR-30 audio system was again six kilos less and by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric the missing kilo.
Although it is also available with the dual-clutch transmission PDK, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmission, mainly on the smaller country roads of California, on mountain routes that were really very winding.
In his driving behavior, you can only give him the note impeccably.
However, the reduction in his weight has by no means led to the fact that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not been tested such a small and light model, which at the same time also gives you a feeling of great safety in the curves, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles in the required time, until we give him the orders to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
He does everything he's told. The car does everything we suggest to it with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is just as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is extremely successful and you can increase it with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The acceleration is unimaginably brutal, whether out of standing or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that's even though we found ice at some of these curves at dawn and roll split in the morning.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable pass, as it usually rarely exists and there is much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 EURO.
Bag Girl'
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the Coco Coco Cocoon cosmetics line and a casual starlette at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her pockets from Chanel.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl," she's a "bag girl."
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many failed players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus comes to the first place within his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was the best of his team with eight three times (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of effort and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triples contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the leadership of the Blue Reds, who put themselves at the top of the scoreboard from the start.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, you could already guess that they had come on the pitch with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, only that the team from Álava opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home, to further expand its advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already beginning to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even if the "minus six" rating of Splitter already suggested that this would not be the Brazilian's best evening.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage at the break, the game was far from being decided and the Maccabeans wanted to remind the Vitorians once again that not everyone wins on their pitch, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elías" they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to the fact that the "yellows" turned the helm (50-49).
Even more disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but anything but dead, had to prepare a few moves with accuracy to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that on the scoreboard again calming distance of (54-67) was indicated by the host at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaveses were exposed in the final quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away from them the victory they honestly deserved in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give their team back through three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was put off the pitch because of fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended themselves well and although the Israelis were still catching up in the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being confronted with
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to cede the lead in Group B of the Euroliga to him, and that in a game marked by the failures on the part of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the inside game, which made victory easier for the Greeks.
The team from Malaga was neither afraid of the mood in the Hall of Peace and Friendship nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their play in the first quarters, the Andalusians were allowed to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 left in the 9th. Minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the erein Unicaja, even if the native team managed to get the scoreboard in the 13th with an inside match between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis. Minute 22-20 indicated in their favour, the minute in which it almost came to the brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and which is why both were disqualified.
The Greek team started to finally get warm and their superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-caused mistakes by Carlos Jiménez clearly left their mark on the Unicaja.
Among their players in the inside field and Lithuanian foreplayer Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th. Minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter of the match was characterized by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which showed itself superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to make the difference of the match played in Malaga with 66-48 in the 27th. Minute to equalize, which in turn caused the lead within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the departure of the injured during the game Scot Robert Archibald.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja came in the 31. Minute thanks to the lead and the triples of Cook and the use of Lewis again some hope of 66-57.
Even so, it was actually impossible, as the Olympiacos, once he attacked and showed his superiority with centimeters within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic made it into the 37th. Minute to raise the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to admit defeat and had to cede the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you earn because of your profile in Facebook?
Facebook's users can now experience their salary that they should earn based on their profile thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job openings and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of the users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users have a form available in Facebook that can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already after a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker feels "poorly paid" on average, explains the person responsible for the product Trovit, Albert Ribera, in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid, according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer gets an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, as opposed to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has an annual net salary of €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with an annual €11,592 net; followed by the work of a seller with €14,725 and that of a worker with €15,667.
The most wanted jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, half-day jobs and social workers.
Brazil names Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for the stay of Manuel Zelaya at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President removed from office must represent the diplomatic mission by 27 at the latest. Leave January 2010 when his mandate officially expires
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian Embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that before that date, he has the message in which he has since the 21st. September had found asylum, had to have left.
“He is aware that he was on 27. January must go, since his mandate expires on this day and he has to find a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the appointed date: "My point of view is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the elections on 29. November (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner) assured Zelaya that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, he tried to get refuge in Brazil this week.
This, however, failed due to Zelaya’s refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician, which the “de facto” government, chaired by Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him.
Thank you!
After the most tempting days since last spring, when inflation in assets was the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned in the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is its natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure applied to stabilise the markets was to settle the debt with the direct purchase of assets and to indirectly leave liquidity free hand in interest rates that move around zero so that banks buy assets for settlement.
Central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are virtually over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are beginning to sprinkle some sand into the gearbox, as the BCE has already put forward with its annual auction, which is taking place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to maintain the economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are witnessing a reversal in reducing risk premiums.
The volabilities of the exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still a far cry from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The states were forced to nationalize the private risks and the national debt rises again.
Quality is now being relied on again and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred refuge of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the countries of the eurozone in terms of Germany.
Spain has so far been hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened a new revision downwards regarding Spain's assessment.
On the other hand, a certain uncertainty does not hurt to silence the defenders of moral risk, who had once again tried to generate awareness among those responsible for world economic policy, for what they had caused, since they had slowed down the devastating effects to which the restriction of credit led to the loss of jobs, when they should actually have decided a new day to the thanksgiving.
Nonetheless, what happened in Dubai suggests a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and development in Greece has also been foreseen earlier.
A government that conceals the national debt, elections and a new government that is pulling in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Sócrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to rescue Hungary from failing to meet their foreign payments earlier this year, thus allowing a eurozone member country to stop complying with its obligations.
On the other hand, it is logical that Ecofin has forced the Greek Government to be transparent and to take on the duty of its citizens in the need for exceptional measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are, as expected, before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some debauchery on excessive amounts, that would now be within what is expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as European corporate bonuses.
However, should the European differences be reduced and the Spanish further increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
That of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local early indicators force much of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which again come with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise a long service life despite warnings.
Once again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although "beware of driving" is currently required.
Connected branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear before the subcommittee of Parliament yesterday, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply is being debated over the next two decades.
Following his appearance, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some bullet points on what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest 50 billion euros and another 60 billion from that date by 2030 by 2020, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this is not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola is of the opinion that one should no longer invest in an increase in energy generation capacity, but in distribution networks and international networks.
From 2020, the question will change and you should increase performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for catching carbon dioxide and, of course, on renewables.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more is needed, under the condition of course by other "support energies".
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy, just passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, by no means wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, we are clearly focusing on this direction, despite some "individual" measures, as the Chairman of Iberdrola described.
Whether it is, Galán thinks that the decisions on investment should already be taken, even if they are long-term, because it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the 'handling' of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for services at ground-season airports, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage service at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, which no figures have yet been announced, is set to last five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a protocol to cooperate to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructure.
The alliance plans to invest 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be the study of energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting to approve its first motorway in Australia, a market where they are already represented as an energy and water company.
The construction it is a tunnel that will cost 1.7 billion Australian dollars (about 1.047 billion euros).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometre tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city administration wants to have completed the construction at the end of 2014.
After the administration had opted for a public-private cooperation (PPP is the English abbreviation) to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration is already in possession of a final list of candidates for construction and toll booth management.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing with each other in the final phase.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of the largest construction companies in Australia, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in civil engineering.
The Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for the infrastructures, and the French assembly Bouygues, will compete against the Acciona team.
The third and final consortium, which is shortlisted, is called LBRJV, formed by the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also native Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian market for infrastructure promises enormous construction work and privatization, but has a hurdle to overcome, because you only get access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that the aforementioned companies Hochtief or Bilfinger have followed, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has only gained access to this market through its participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of the mentioned Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of the highest importance for the industry, in which it is already very well known for its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Under other assets, it already has its largest windmill farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies that have been tasked with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
His intention now is to consolidate in these two areas and to exploit these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The underground toll track, which is funded by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Office and is called Northern Link (Northern Feeder), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) over a length of 5 kilometres through tunnels. This is the largest measure to reduce congestion on the roads of Brisbane.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Even if this toll route is already to open up to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that the construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is contributing 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to the financing.
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big deal.
Australia repeatedly awards substantial orders to Hochtief, which signed a contract with the government in the amount of 154 million yesterday.
The sub-company ACS will use its domestic subsidiary Leighton to improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber optic cable.
This improvement will create fast internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work has not yet begun and Hochtief has received 129 million for this.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and administration of two schools to 25 years.
Initial investment amounts to €75 million.
FCC awarded contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC has secured the construction of a tunnel over a length of 2.1 kilometres for a motorway in Slovenia over the sum of 64.5 million euros through its subsidiary Alpine.
The company received this contract only a few days after it was awarded the contract for the construction work to expand the tunnel of Bosruck (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine is strengthening its experience in tunnel construction.
The start of construction work is planned for the beginning of 2010 and its implementation will drag on for 32 months.
Sra. Rushmore receives advertising budget from Renfe
Renfe has the advertising and marketing services for the next two years of the agency Sra. Rushmore over a sum of about three million euros annually attributed, the railway company said.
This contract also offers two extensions of 12 months each. Sra. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented to this competition advertised by Renfe, 4 of which came to the final round, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the past three years.
From now on, Sra will. Rushmore is tasked with designing and manufacturing the campaigns.
Penalty over 63 million for France Télécom for slowing down the competition.
The Competition Regulatory Authority in France has imposed a fine of €63 million for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean territories belonging to the country.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition in fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programs for consumers on the verge of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned enterprise has accumulated more than €560 million in penalties since 1994 for obstructing its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased as the authority that monitors competition believes that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore relapsed.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading site on the Internet for the purpose of increasing revenue from businesses that do not originate from the telephone connection.
Basically, this Orange application website is active in France and the United Kingdom.
You have to wait until 2010 until these sites will be available to other countries, such as Spain.
The game at the Champions League has brought in Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
The Champions League has developed into a source of income for the football clubs since its emergence in 1992.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in 476.4 million, earning them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have made the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning UEFA's Champions League doesn't just bring glory. It is also one of the main sources of income of the major clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish) to participate in this event since it was founded in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The white club is in third place in Europe, which has made the most money through its participation and the only one to win the trophy three times alongside AC Milan.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 ranks fifth.
The list is top by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also took the most money through their participation in the past Champions League.
Even though they lost to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third in the countries that could raise money through the champions, although it has more titles than anyone else (five, as opposed to four to Italy, three at England and two at Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated granting of funds that UEFA is applying.
In this financial year, the organization, whose chairmanship Michel Platini holds, expects revenues of 1,090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA provides for 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that took part in the qualifying preliminary round (including the Atlético de Madrid) got 2.1 million.
In addition, those who fought for participation received 3.8 million through their none presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team). The clubs that have advanced to the quarter-finals will each receive three million; the four who have advanced to the quarter-finals, 3.3 million.
The last four get 4 million each.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, which receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed revenues.
Barça, in turn, earned 2.5 million with his victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are planned.
This money is allocated proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is among the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year’s master receives 40% of the money allocated, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for fourth place.
The other part will be distributed depending on the number of games they play at this year’s edition.
Nueva Rumasa to offer 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday leaked details of the purchase offer of shares, with which it intends to acquire a cap of between 25 and 29.9% of Sos's capital.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (opa) due to the number of shares.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which is paid out to ten years and with an interest rate of 1% annually due to this shift.
Yesterday, Sos shares closed at €1.85, which is why Nueva Rumasa is valuing the company 18% below market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is associated with the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz Group gives shareholders a 15-day period to communicate their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company reiterated Ruiz Mateos that it had contacted the authority.
At a close, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to remain on the verge of possible purchase offers and the judicial quarrels of his ex-managers, the brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal auditing.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high post at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly subject to the chairman of the group.
This is anything but polemic free because the company is engaged in a judicial battle on suspicion of redirecting more than 230 million of Sos to other societies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will shift further capital over the course of the next few months.
With regard to the Salazar's loan, ex-advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday, confirming that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their provision.
CNMV approves the public exclusion tender submitted by the investment company Mer by Paternina
The National Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public exclusion tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer last 9. October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved this invitation to tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions comply with the legally binding laws and thus the content of the explanatory supplement submitted, following the amendments of the last 2. December, can be considered "sufficient."
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550,000 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of €7.65 per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the share capital, which is composed of €6,142,786 in shares admitted on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares have been permanently invested, which cannot be transferred in any way until the conclusion of the tender and the price of which was fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the legally binding laws.
New programs for the assessment of vehicles
These days of severe weather and accidents not only the car workshops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to the workshops, where an appraiser must assess the damage incurred and the cost of repairing it.
Not a single accident is the same and calculating the cost of the parts and working hours can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest IT tools, it is a matter of minutes
This is why almost 100% of the reviewers use this type of systems.
Service and application providers for the assessment of accidents and repairs collect the information they receive from the manufacturers in order to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all expert reports are prepared with their products.
The other two companies competing with the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data that manufacturers provide is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, sales manager of Audatex, works with 63 manufacturers and importers, with each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is getting larger, to the point that even more versions, variants and engines have been launched in the last five years than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car is launched, work begins for the companies.
It is a tedious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catagolized and entered its price.
In addition, a "smart" graphic image is created from each model, on which you can "click" on different parts of the vehicle.
If this is a much-sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If this is a less common car, it can take up to three or four months. At present, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information about the Porsche models, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the vehicle fleet travelling on the road, it is over 99%.
For the purpose of carrying out the documentation work and the production of databases, Audatex has eight centers distributed worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics professionals) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests €90 million annually in the preparation of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in various ways and thereby offer different products.
The most common use is the use for the repairs and repairs, however, depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the file or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a guide who informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
When reviewing the products that Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the kind of support it gives to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star of the products being AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles, as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the paint prices.
This tool is paid for depending on the purpose, i.e. for each report.
It will be the most expensive for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that prepares thousands of expert reports negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, you can fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran off the assembly line, solely on the basis of the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an open service on the Internet for the specialist market, with which you can offer vehicles that have been declared a total loss.
Your statistical service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses, or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
One can use it to investigate, for example, how many models of a particular car brand had to go to the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to developing this type of computer tools.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and supplies digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer in the same way.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and/or Maintenance of vehicles was established.
The GT leader for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased at 20% annually in the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to EUR 10.8 million.
At the beginning of last year, they began to go to the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America. They work with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total revenue in the world of the Solera group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, up 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are traded at a value of $2.4 billion.
They have been on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicle and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer more services and value enhancement to its customers, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is aimed exclusively at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Their main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site today has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added every day on the Spanish market.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose chassis number has been logged off may no longer be used on the road, but certain non-damaged parts may be used as spare parts.
The cars with historical value, on the other hand, may be allowed to be allowed back, even if they have been deregistered after difficult administrative procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search of the spare part, creation and preparation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less opposed to the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection for use.
After the model to be repaired has been identified on the basis of the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and after that the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts and after that, he can have the cost estimate printed out and passed it on to his customer.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for reviewing like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop-oriented does not involve estimated working hours.
The cost of use for this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount that the customer can easily pay.
The company Audatex is currently working on being able to offer these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, because you can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the picture completely over to look at the inside.
