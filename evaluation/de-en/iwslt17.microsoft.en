Meet James Risen.
You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.
Long before anyone had ever heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he spectacularly published that the NSA had illegally tapped Americans' phones.
But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.
In it, he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA literally handed Iran designs for a nuclear bomb.
If this sounds crazy, read it.
It's an incredible story.
But do you know who didn't like the chapter?
The U.S. government.
For nearly 10 years, the government has been investigating Risen and asking him to name his alleged sources.
In the process, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of convicting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.
Under the First Amendment, the media has the right to publish classified information.
But it is impossible to apply this right if the media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave who reveal it.
So when the government knocked on Risen's door, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused, saying he'd rather go to jail.
From 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going to prison.
But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.
Suddenly, despite arguing for years that it was essential to their case, the government's demands on Risen were dropped.
The reason: In the age of electronic surveillance, reporters and sources can hide less and less.
Instead of failing and getting Risen to testify, his digital footprints could do the same for him.
And so, without his consent, the investigators secretly obtained his telephone records,
as well as his email details, financial and banking information, his credit report, and even proof of travel with the list of his flights.
In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and Risen's alleged source.
Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.
President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers. But instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US administrations before it combined.
Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as secret.
Since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist.
So we're jeopardizing the press work that the First Amendment is supposed to protect, because the government has more and more opportunities to spy on everyone.
But just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technology to better protect its sources.
And they can do so from the moment they make contact, rather than afterwards, on the witness stand.
Today, there is communication software that didn't exist when Risen wrote his book, and it's much more secure than regular emails or phone calls.
One such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source whistleblower delivery system originally developed by the Internet fame, Aaron Swartz, who passed away, and has now been further developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.
Instead of sending an email, you go to a news website, like the one here at the Washington Post.
There you can upload documents or send information, just like with any ordinary contact form.
These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.
So the government can't secretly obtain more information, and much of the information it would request wouldn't be available in the first place.
But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.
Unfortunately, governments around the world are constantly developing new espionage technologies that put us all at risk.
It is up to us to ensure that not only technology experts like Edward Snowden have an opportunity to expose misdeeds. It is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower,
who knows about abuses in the care of soldiers and wants to report on overcrowded hospitals. Or the next environmental worker who raises the alarm about Flint's contaminated water. Or a Wall Street insider warning us of the next financial crisis.
After all, these technologies were made not only for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect the constitutional rights of us all.
Thank you.
[On April 3, 2016, the largest data leak in history was released.] [The "Panama Papers" reveal that the rich and powerful] [have hidden enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [What does this mean?] [We asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were told by news of a leak of 11 million documents from Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.
The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.
We get a sense of how clients, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mossack Fonseca and say, "Okay, we need an anonymous company. Can you set that up?"
We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works, how it works.
This has already led to the first very direct consequences.
Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.
There are also reports that an ally of brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has shell companies in tax havens.
It is claimed that a trail of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, via a close childhood friend, a famous cellist.
Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others nervously waiting for the next release, and for the next revealed documents.
Now this sounds like the plot of a spy thriller or a John Grisham novel.
It seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people.
Why should this concern us?
But the truth is, if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for essential public services such as healthcare, education, roads.
And that affects us all.
For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.
Around the world, media and world leaders are discussing how secret tax havens are being used by a few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something we have been discussing and exposing for a decade.
I think many people find this whole world very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.
I always imagine it like a matryoshkadoll.
So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these entities.
It can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society, to really understand what is going on.
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports on this matter in the US.
Probably because there have been no prominent Americans who have appeared in these revelations, this scandal.
Now, it's not that there aren't rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens.
But because of the principle that these tax havens operate, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers.
If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see many more cases and examples that have connections to the US.
In fact, in some U.S. states, you need less information, less information to start a business, than you need to get a library card.
This kind of lack of transparency in the U.S. has allowed school district employees to rip off schoolchildren.
It has allowed fraudsters to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.
It's this kind of behavior that affects us all.
Here at Global Witness, we wanted to find out what all of this looks like in practice.
How does it actually work?
So we sent an undercover agent to the offices of 13 law firms in Manhattan.
Our investigator posed as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.
We were really shocked that all but one lawyer made suggestions to our investigator on how he could transfer his money.
These were all preliminary discussions. None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no money was handed over to anyone. But it shows the problem with this system.
It is also important not to consider these as isolated cases.
It is not about a single lawyer who made proposals to our undercover agent.
It is not about a single top politician embroiled in a scandal.
It is about how the system works, through which corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability are established.
And to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game.
We need to change the rules to make this kind of behaviour more difficult.
This may all sound very gloomy, as if there is nothing we can do about it; as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful.
But as a born optimist, I can certainly see that a lot has begun to change.
In the last few years, we've seen pushes towards greater transparency about company owners.
The issue received political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.
Since then, the EU has recorded in central registers at national level who is really behind companies in Europe and who controls them.
One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.
Representatives of both parties have tabled a bill in both chambers of parliament, but it is not making the progress we would like to see.
We would really like to see these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, being used as a means of increasing transparency in the US and globally.
For us at Global Witness, this is a moment for change.
We need ordinary people who get angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind shell companies.
We need leaders in business who stand up and say, "Lack of transparency is not good for business."
We need leaders who recognize the problem and are committed to putting an end to this kind of lack of transparency through legislation.
Together, we can finally put an end to the lack of transparency that this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering still allows.
This is the story of how I once almost got kidnapped and ended up in the trunk of a red Mazda.
One day after I finished my design degree, I did a backyard sale.
A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.
He bought one of my artworks.
He was alone in the city and was on a road trip all over the country. After that, he would go to the Peace Corps.
I invited him for a beer. He enthusiastically told me how he wanted to change the world.
It was getting late. I got tired.
While we were paying the bill, I made the mistake of asking him, "Where are you sleeping tonight?"
He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."
And I thought, "Oh, man!
What do I do now?"
Who does not know the situation?
Do I have to offer a place to sleep now?
But I just met him! He says he would join the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans to. I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!
That's a small trunk!
Then I heard myself say, "I have an air mattress. You can sleep in my living room."
A voice in my head said, "Uh, what?"
At night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought, "Oh man! What have I gotten myself into?
A complete stranger sleeps in my living room.
What if he's crazy?"
I got so scared that I got out of bed, tiptoed to the door, and locked my bedroom door.
But he wasn't crazy at all.
We are still in contact.
The artwork he bought from me now hangs in his classroom. He is now a teacher.
This was my first experience as a host. It completely changed my perspective.
Maybe the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends just waiting to be discovered?
Hosting people on my air mattress became normal for me. When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.
Let's jump back in time, two years later...
I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate moves out and the rent is increased.
I learned that there was a design conference in the city at the time. All hotels were fully booked.
I believe creativity can turn fear into fun.
I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I was thinking about how we could make some extra money. Our apartment becomes a designer bed-and-breakfast. Young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and breakfast every morning.
Ha!"
We created a website and founded "Air Mattress and Breakfast" [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].
Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.
They loved it, and so did we.
I'm sure our cheese and ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.
We toured with them all over the city. As we said goodbye to our last guest and the door fell into the lock, Brian and I stared at each other.
Had we just discovered that we could make new friends and pay our rent at the same time?
Things got rolling.
My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.
We wanted to find out if it could be turned into a business concept.
Here's how we presented ourselves to investors: "We want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors you close when visitors come by.
Via the Internet, they can then invite strangers to spend the night with them.
This is going to be the next big thing!"
We waited for the rocket to ignite.
But she didn't.
No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in other people's apartments.
Why?
Because as children, we all learned that strangers are dangerous.
When you have a problem, you focus on the things you are good at. We were able to design.
At art school, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it's the overall experience.
We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.
Can design do something like that?
Is it possible to create trust with design?
I would like to give you an idea of the degree of trust we were striving for.
It's a 30-second experiment. It will force you out of your comfort zone.
Thumbs up when you're ready.
Pick up your phone.
Now I would like you to unlock your phone.
Give your unlocked phone to your left seatmate.
That faint hint of panic you -- -- feel now is exactly what hosts feel when they first open the door.
Because the only thing that's more personal than your phone is your home.
Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.
How does it feel to hold a stranger's unlocked phone in your hands?
Most feel the responsibility.
This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.
This is the only reason why our company can exist.
Just like that, who actually has Al Gore's cell phone now?
Could you please announce on Twitter that he is running for president?
You can return the phones now.
You have now seen what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.
What if we changed a small detail about this experiment?
What if your neighbor had introduced himself by his name; if he had told where he comes from, what his dog or children are called?
Imagine if you had 150 reviews that all say, "He's really good at capturing unlocked phones!"
How would you feel if you had to hand in your phone?
Because a well-thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.
In the beginning, we did some things wrong.
It was hard for people to give negative reviews.
In the end, we decided to wait until both host and guest had submitted their reviews before posting them online.
Last week we discovered something new.
We conducted a study with Stanford. We looked at how likely people are to trust each other, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and location.
Unsurprisingly, we trust the people who are most similar to us the most.
The more differences we find, the less we trust.
This is a natural social bias.
It gets exciting when you add a person's reputation -- in our case, through judgments.
If you have fewer than three reviews, nothing changes.
But if you have more than ten, everything changes.
A good reputation stands out for similarities.
So, the right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.
We also learned that trust depends on how much you reveal about yourself.
Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.
If you say too little, such as "Hi!", you are more likely to get no answer.
If you say too much, such as: "I have problems with my mother" -- -- the request is unlikely to be accepted.
So there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g. "Great artwork in your apartment! I'm on holiday with my family."
How can you manage to create this degree of openness with design?
We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. We also give tips on which topics you should write something about.
Our entire business is built on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.
What we didn't expect was the large number of people who were more than willing to get rid of these prejudices.
Here you can see how many people use our offer.
You can see three things.
First: incredible luck.
Secondly, the tireless work of our team.
Thirdly, a need that had not previously been met.
For us, business is going very well right now.
Of course, there are also times when not everything runs smoothly.
There were guests who celebrated parties without permission or vandalized apartments.
Hosts have left guests out in the rain.
At the beginning of the project, I worked in customer service. All calls came directly to my phone.
I was at the forefront when trust was broken.
There is nothing worse than these calls. It hurts just to think about it.
The disappointment you hear in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve.
Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays arranged, only a fraction ever had a problem.
Because people rightly trusted each other.
When trust works, wonderful things can happen.
One of our guests was on holiday in Uruguay. There he suffered a heart attack.
His host drove him to the hospital.
He even donated blood for the necessary operation!
Here is his assessment:
"Perfect house for travelers prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.
The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.
Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save your life, even though they don't really know you.
They drive you to the hospital in your own car when you die and wait while you get a bypass.
Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books.
They even let you stay longer without charging the extra nights.
I can only recommend it!"
Of course, not every stay works like this.
But these relationships behind the money-only transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the sharing economy.
When I first stumbled across this term, I wondered:
How does the idea of sharing fit in with monetary transactions?
This is about economic trade.
But simply calling it the "rental industry" now doesn't do it justice.
Share economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.
People reveal a part of themselves, and that changes everything.
When you travel these days, it's like fast food. It is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.
But what if travel was a rich buffet of local impressions?
What if, at every place you visit, a group of local residents were waiting to bottle you thoroughly and show you neighborhoods you've never heard of on a pub crawl;
or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?
Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.
What if we designed apartments from the ground up for sharing?
What would that look like?
What if cities embraced the idea of shared participation?
I imagine cities that give us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation.
This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. Many parking lots owned by the government,
were now offered to residents. Students looking for a place to stay,
were placed with people whose children had moved out. Incubator programmes have been launched,
to finance new start-ups in the sharing economy. Through our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be visiting or hosting a stranger tonight.
So the idea doesn't seem as crazy as we've been taught.
We have not reinvented the wheel.
Hospitality was there before.
There were similar websites before us.
So why did ours work?
Luck and timing aside, we realized that you can find the right design with the ingredients of trust.
Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.
I find that amazing,
Overwhelming.
I have to think about it every time a red Mazda drives past me.
We know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem.
But if it could help us, if it had this big impact, I wonder what we can use design for in the near future.
Thank you.
What do you think when you look at me?
A believer? An expert?
Maybe even a sister.
Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?
Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.
This is indeed true.
I don't blame you for your negative impressions.
That's how the media portrays people who look like me.
One study found that 80% of coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.
Studies show that Americans think that most people don't know Muslims.
Presumably, people don't talk to their Uber drivers.
For those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to meet you.
I'll tell you who I am.
I'm a mom, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.
I am an introvert,
a wannabe fitness fanatic,
and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim.
But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way.
I decided to do so.
When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to come out.
No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the hijab, my headgear.
My feminist friends were horrified: "Why are you oppressing yourself?"
The funny thing was: At the time, it was a feminist declaration of independence for me, in the face of the pressure I felt as a 17-year-old to conform to a perfect and unattainable ideal of beauty.
I didn't just passively embrace my parents' faith.
I wrestled with the Koran.
I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and finally believed.
My relationship with God was not love at first sight.
It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.
The beauty of the rhythm sometimes makes me cry.
I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.
Have you ever felt that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves you?
That's how it feels.
Later I got married and, like all good Egyptians, started my career as an engineer.
Later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the "Egyptian-American Dream".
Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.
Many of you probably remember exactly where you were.
I was sitting in my kitchen, finished having breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word "breaking news."
There was smoke, planes flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings.
What was that?
An accident?
A technical malfunction?
My shock quickly turned into outrage.
Why would you do such a thing?
I changed TV channels and heard: "... Muslim terrorists...," "... in the name of Islam...," "... of Middle Eastern descent ...," "... Jihad...," "... bomb Mecca!"
Oh my god.
Not only has my country been attacked, but in no time the actions of others have transformed me from a citizen into a suspect.
On the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start postgraduate studies.
I remember -- as we drove in silence -- crouched as low as I could in my seat, and for the first time I was afraid of being recognized as a Muslim.
We moved into our apartment that night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.
And then I heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations, which said: "Be vigilant", "Be careful", "Stay in well-lit areas", "Do not gather".
I stayed inside all week.
Then it became Friday of that week -- the day Muslims gather to pray.
And again, the warnings were: "Don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a target."
I watched the extensive coverage.
The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who were thought to be Muslims, dragged outside and beaten.
There really were arson attacks on mosques.
I thought: We should stay at home.
But something didn't feel right.
Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.
I got people's anger at the terrorists.
Just imagine! I was angry too.
It's not easy to have to explain yourself all the time.
I don't mind questions, I love questions.
It is the accusations that are harsh.
These days, we can actually hear people say, "There's a problem in this country -- it's called Muslims.
When will we get rid of them?"
Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.
They speak of my church as a tumor in the body of the United States.
The only question is: are we malignant or benign?
You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only kept under observation.
The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrongly posed.
Muslims, like all other Americans, are not a tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ.
Thank you!
Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.
Will closing mosques make America safer?
It may keep a few parking spaces free, but it won't stop the terror.
Regular visits to a mosque lead to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths and greater citizen participation.
And as a police chief in the Washington, D.C. area told me recently, people aren't actually radicalized in mosques.
They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.
The radicalisation process has been found to start online. First, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can brainwash that leads the person to believe the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or apostate.
If we want to prevent radicalisation, we need to encourage people to go to the mosque.
Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.
After all, a group like IS justifies its brutality with the Koran.
As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we must do everything we can to stop a group like ISIS.
But we would fit into their imagination if they were recognized as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.
Thank you!
ISIS has as much to do with Islam as the Ku Klux Klan has to do with Christianity.
Both groups assert their ideology based on their "Holy Book".
But if you look at them, they are not driven by what they read in their "Holy Scriptures."
It is their brutality that makes them read these things into Scripture.
An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:
A girl came to him because she was planning to join ISIS.
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.
He said the problem was just the opposite. Every clergyman she spoke to silenced her, telling her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only get her into trouble.
Inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense of her anger, she was a prime target for exploitation by extremists who promised her a solution.
This Imam restored the connection to God and their community.
Instead of blaming her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for real change in the world.
What she learned in the mosque saved her from joining ISIS.
That was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.
But how does it affect ordinary Americans?
How does it affect everyone else?
How does the 24-hour consumption of fear every day affect our democracy, our freedom of thought?
One study -- actually several neuroscience studies -- shows that when we're afraid, at least three things happen.
We are more likely to accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.
One study shows that when test subjects are presented with messages that report negatively about Muslims, they are more likely to agree to military attacks on Muslim countries and the curtailment of the rights of American Muslims.
This is not just an academic problem.
If you look at when anti-Muslim sentiment soared -- between 2001 and 2013 -- it happened three times, but never in the context of terrorist attacks.
It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.
So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected.
It can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well-informed citizens.
Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.
We may be the first to feel it, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.
Assigning collective guilt is not just about having to explain yourself.
Deah and his wife, Yusor, were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.
Deah was an athlete.
He was at the dental school, talented, promising ...
His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.
She visited him there and he showed her his CV. She was amazed and said:
"When did my little brother become such an accomplished young man?"
Just a few weeks after Suzanne visited her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, as did Yusor's sister, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon. He did it in her apartment, like an execution, after posting remarks against Muslims on his Facebook page.
He shot Deah eight times.
Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly.
So back to the beginning.
What happened after 9/11?
Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safely at home?
We discussed it, and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we wanted to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we could practice our religion freely.
We chose the mosque.
With our son in the child seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.
I took it out, took off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw made me stop.
The hall was completely filled.
Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked us and welcomed our guests, because half of those gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to help us.
At that moment I collapsed.
These people were there because they preferred courage and compassion to panic and prejudice.
What will you choose?
What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?
Will you play it safe?
Or will you join those who think: We are better than them.
Thank you very much.
Thank you!
Helen Walters: Well, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.
But I wonder what do you say to those who might claim that you hold a TEDTalk, are a thinker with depth, work in a posh think tank, so you are an exception and not the rule.
What would you say to those people?
Dalia Mogahed: I would say make no mistake. I am perfectly normal.
I am no exception.
My story is not unusual.
I am as ordinary as is allowed.
If you look at Muslims around the world, and I did so with the largest study ever conducted on Muslims around the world, people want normal things.
They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.
So I'm not an exception in any way.
If people seem like an exception to the rule, then often the rule has been broken, and they are not the exception to the rule.
HW: Thank you very much. Dalia Mogahed.
What began as a platform for hobbyists is on the verge of becoming a billion-dollar business.
Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. This is made possible in research institutions worldwide.
Before air parcel delivery entered our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines built a six-metre-high tower made of 1,500 bricks live in front of an audience at the FRAC Centre in France. A few years ago, they began to fly with ropes.
By tying them together, aircraft achieve high speed and acceleration in the tightest of spaces.
You can also independently build tensile structures.
They have learned to carry loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to the laws of nature.
Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.
Our goal is to push the boundaries of what is possible in autonomous flight.
For a system to function autonomously, it must collectively know where in space the mobile objects are located.
In our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. This then allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.
For today's demos, we're using new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offshoot of our lab.
There are no external cameras.
Each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, calculations on board determine what the machine should do.
External commands exist at the highest level. e.g. "take off" and "land".
This is a so-called rear starter,
an aircraft that tries to kill two birds with one stone.
Like other fixed-wing aircraft, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations.
Unlike most fixed-wing aircraft, it can hover, and thus has great advantages during take-off and landing, and is very versatile.
However, there is always a downside.
One limitation of tail starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as gusts of wind.
We are developing new controls and algorithms to improve this.
The idea behind this is that no matter in which position, the aircraft can regain the optimal position and the performance can be improved by practicing.
Ok.
During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that get to the heart of the matter.
One such question would be, for example: What is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?
There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.
Helicopters, for example, are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that join together to injure you.
Decades ago, trained pilots could fly remote-controlled aircraft that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.
Recently, we discovered that flying works with just one.
This is the monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote-controlled aircraft. It was invented recently.
It has only one moving part, a propeller,
no flaps, hinges and ailerons, no other actuators or control surfaces, just one propeller.
Although it is mechanically simple, a lot happens inside so that it can fly stably and move anywhere in space.
Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear starter. To make it fly, I have to throw it just right.
The likelihood of throwing it just right when everyone is watching me is low, so I'm going to show you a video that was filmed last night.
If the monospinner is an exercise in frugality, this machine here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, is an exercise in abundance.
What to do with all this abundance?
You can see that it is extremely symmetrical.
That is why he is ambivalent in his orientation.
This gives him the extraordinary ability to:
to move in all directions in space, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even how it rotates.
Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive flows from the eight propellers.
Some can be represented in models, the rest is learned directly while flying.
Let's take a look.
If flying machines are to be part of our everyday lives, they must become extremely safe and reliable.
This machine here consists of two separate two-propeller flying machines.
This rotates clockwise
and the other counterclockwise.
When assembled, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.
However, if something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller fails, the electronics or a battery -- the plane can continue to fly, albeit to a limited extent.
We will now demonstrate this by rendering one half flightless.
The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.
The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.
We took off-the-shelf micro-quadcopters -- each weighing less than a slice of bread -- and equipped them with localization technology and algorithms.
Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. That is why there is no upper limit.
Hopefully, these demonstrations will motivate you to come up with new revolutionary ideas.
The particularly safe machine over there wants to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.
Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.
For guys like us, the reward lies in the development and the act of creation.
It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to shape it in such spectacular ways.
The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.
Thank you very much.
1.3 billion years ago, in a galaxy very far away, two black holes orbited each other faster and faster, converting the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.
For this brief moment, they shone brighter than all the stars combined in all the galaxies of the entire known universe.
It was a very big bang.
But they did not release their energy in the form of light --
after all, we are talking about black holes.
All the energy was released into the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.
Let us first classify the events in time.
1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life had just emerged on Earth.
Since then, the earth has produced many things: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans, and -- God bless us -- even the Internet.
About 25 years ago, a group of particularly brave people -- Rai Weiss of MIT, Kip Thorne, and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a giant laser detector to look for gravitational waves caused by colliding black holes.
Most thought she was crazy.
But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses that the U.S. National Science Foundation funded their idea.
After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work, they built the LIGO detector: the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
Subsequently, the accuracy of LIGO was significantly increased, which greatly improved the detection performance.
That's why it's now called Advanced LIGO.
At the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was launched for a final test run to clarify some smaller, persistent problems.
On September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector went into operation, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the Earth.
They went through you and me
and also through the detector.
Scott Hughes: Only two moments in my life have been more emotional than this:
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell to my terminally ill father.
Basically, these were the fruits of my life's work.
Everything I worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: That's my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, a theoretical physicist at MIT. For 23 years, he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observatories such as LIGO. But what are gravitational waves?
A gravitational wave is a ripple in the fabric of space and time.
As the wave passes, the space and all its contents are stretched in one direction and compressed in the other.
To illustrate, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often perform a really silly dance.
"Stretching and compressing, stretching and compressing."
The problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.
On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and compressed as the waves hit. The stretch of an average person was 10 to the power of -21.
That is, 20 zeros after the decimal point, followed by a 1. That's why the LIGO employees were declared crazy.
With a five-kilometer-long laser detector, and this is absurd, this length would have to be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. This is grotesque.
At the end of his classic text on gravitation
Kip Thorne, a co-founder of LIGO, described the hunt for the waves as follows: "The technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.
But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."
Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success.
Back to LIGO. Scott likes to say that LIGO is more an ear than an eye.
Let me explain what that means.
Visible light has a wavelength much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your phone.
This is quite convenient. This is because you can make a picture or map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.
It's different with sounds.
Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.
That's why it's very difficult, actually impossible, to make a picture of things that mean a lot to you:
your child's face, for example.
Instead, we listen for certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to infer the story behind them.
"Now Alice is speaking."
"And Bob interrupts her."
"Stupid Bob."
The same applies to gravitational waves.
We can't use them to make simple images of objects in space.
But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.
At least for LIGO the measured frequencies are in the audible range.
So when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe talking.
Listening to gravity can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has been working on for a very long time.
SH: Two black, non-spinning holes, just chirping: whoop!
If the two bodies rotate very quickly, you can hear the same chirping with an additional key change. It sounds like this: wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!
It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the wave form.
AA: On September 14, 2015 -- a date I at least will never forget -- LIGO heard the following: [whirring sound] Someone who knows what to listen for recognizes this as the sound of -- SH: ... two black holes, each 30 times the mass of the Sun, spinning about as fast as the bars of your blender.
AA: Let's think about what that means.
Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, orbit each other a hundred times per second before colliding.
Imagine these forces.
Fantastic.
And we know about it because we've heard it.
This is the enduring significance of LIGO.
LIGO paves a whole new way to explore space in a way that has never been possible before.
In this way we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.
There are many things we can't see in space -- practically or fundamentally.
A supernova, for example. I would like to know why massive stars explode in supernovae.
They are very useful. We learned a lot about space from them.
However, the exciting physical processes take place in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon.
We will never see through them because they are opaque.
Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. The Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of space, but we will never see them because the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow.
With the help of gravitational waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning.
And probably the most important thing: I am optimistic that there are things in space that we have never seen before, that we will probably never see and of which we have no idea. Things we only discover by listening.
In fact, LIGO found things we didn't expect right at the first attempt.
My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, a key member of the LIGO project, says on this topic: ME: The kind of stars that make black holes, as LIGO observes, are the dinosaurs of the universe.
They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. The black holes are, so to speak, the dinosaur bones for our archaeological work.
LIGO gives us a completely different perspective on what happens in space, on the formation of stars and, ultimately, on how we emerged from this chaos.
AA: The challenge now is to be as brave as possible.
Thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.
We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.
After all, what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang itself?
Now is the time for big dreams.
Dream with us.
Thank you.
Some time ago I tried an experiment.
For a year, I would say "Yes!" to anything I was afraid of.
Whether it made me nervous, put me in awkward situations, I forced myself to say "yes."
Did I want to speak in public?
No, but yes!
Did I want to be live on TV?
No, but yes!
Did I want to start acting?
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.
And one crazy thing happened: doing exactly what I was afraid of removed my fear.
My fear of giving speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.
The power of a word is impressive.
"Yes" changed my life.
"Yes" changed me.
But there was a certain yes that profoundly changed my life, in an unexpected way. It started with a question from my little ones.
I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. And Emerson, the smallest, inexplicably calls all "sweethearts,"
as if she were a waitress from the south.
"Darling, I need milk for my beaked cup."
She once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. And I said, "Yes."
This yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family. From then on, I swore to myself to always play with them as soon as you asked me to. No matter what I'm doing or where I'm going, I always say yes -- every single time.
Almost. I'm not perfect, but I try very hard.
It has a magical effect on me, on my children, on our family.
But it also has a startling side effect: Only recently did I fully understand that saying "yes" to playing with my children saved my career.
I have a real dream job.
I am an author. I make things up, bring them to life.
Dream job.
No.
I am a titan.
Dream job.
I create TV. I produce television.
I make television, on a grand scale.
This TV season, I'm responsible for bringing 70 hours of programming out into the world.
Four TV channels, 70 hours of television. Three to four shows are in production at the same time.
Each show offers hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.
The budget for an episode of a television station can range from three to six million dollars.
Let's say five.
A new episode every nine days times four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollars television, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows that are in production at the same time, times four, 16 episodes at the same time: 24 episodes: Grey's, 21 episodes: Scandal, 15 episodes: How To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: The Catch, 70 hours of television,
350 million dollars for one season.
In America, my TV series run one after the other on Thursday nights.
Around the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.
My brain is global, and 45 of those 70 hours of TV are shows that I created myself, not just produced, so on top of that. I need to find time, really quiet, creative time, to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.
Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows in production at the same time, $350 million, bonfires burning around the world.
Do you know who else is doing this?
Nobody, that's why I'm a Titan.
Dream job.
I do not want to impress you.
I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" is mentioned.
I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously when I talk about work, so that you understand that I am not just typing and fantasizing on the computer, and it is true when I say: I understand,  that a dream job is not about dreaming.
It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.
I work a lot, hard and I love it.
When I am engrossed in the work, there is no other feeling.
My work always creates a country out of nothing.
It's like I'm setting up troops, like I'm painting on a canvas.
As if hitting a high note, running a marathon.
You feel like Beyoncé.
And all this at the same time.
I love to work.
It is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinical and maternal, cruel and reasonable. And the best part is the buzzing.
There is such a change in me when the work is going well.
A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could ride on it forever.
Many people assume that when I explain the buzzing to them, I am talking about writing, that I enjoy writing.
Don't get me wrong, it does.
But the buzz -- when I started producing television, when I started working and working and doing, building, creating, and collaborating, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. The buzz!
Buzzing is more than writing.
The buzzing is action and activity. The buzzing is a drug.
The humming is music. The buzz is light and air.
The buzzing is God's voice in my ear.
And if you have such a buzz, then you can't help but strive for greatness.
The feeling of not being able to help but strive for greatness, no matter the cost.
This is called buzzing.
Or maybe it means being a workaholic.
Maybe it's called genius.
Maybe it's called Ego.
Maybe it's the fear of failure.
I don't know.
All I know is that I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love buzzing.
I just want to tell you, I'm a titan, and I know I don't want to question it.
To make one thing clear: the more successful I become, the more shows, the more episodes, the more boundaries overcome, the more work there is, the more things at the same time, the more watching me, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.
The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.
And what did I say about work?
I love work, don't I?
The country I create, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.
I like this buzz. I love buzzing.
I need the buzz. I am the buzz.
Am I just this buzz?
And then the buzzing stopped.
Overworked, overused, exaggerated, burned out.
The buzzing stopped.
Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working titan.
Harper tells people, "My mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."
And Emerson says, "Darling, I want to go to Shonda Land."
They are the children of a titan.
They are baby titans.
They were 12, 3 and 1 when the buzzing stopped.
The hum of the engine stopped.
I didn't love my work anymore. The engine was off.
The buzzing didn't come back.
My buzz was broken.
I did the same things as always: the same Titan work, 15-hour days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing delegating, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with all his heart, clear eyes, whatever.
But there was no buzz.
There was silence in me.
Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.
Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect titan.
I was a model titan,
Everything was grey, I just wasn't having fun anymore.
And that was my life.
Everything I did.
I was the buzz and the buzz was me.
So what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?
I know some may think, "Cry out, stupid author titan."
But you know, you do it, you do it, you work, you love what you do, to be a teacher, to be a banker, to be a mother, a painter, to be Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the buzz if you know the buzzing, and you know what humming feels like if you ever knew the buzzing.  if the buzzing stops, who are you?
What are they?
What am I?
Am I still a Titan?
When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?
And then my "Southern waitress" asks me a question.
I'm on my way out, late, and she says, "Mom, do you like to play?"
And I want to say no when I realize two things:
Firstly, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she did not call me "sweetheart".
She doesn't call anyone "sweetheart" anymore.
When did this happen?
I miss it when I'm Titan mourning my buzzing, and this is where everything changes before my own eyes.
And so she says, "Mom, do you like to play?"
And I say, "Yes."
There is nothing special about that.
We play and her sisters join, we laugh a lot and I read dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops".
Nothing out of the ordinary.
But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the buzz, I can do nothing but pay attention.
I'm focused.
I am quiet.
The country I'm creating, the marathon I'm running, the army, the canvas, the high-pitched tone — they don't exist anymore.
All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, crayons and the song about letting go, or whatever the girl in "Frozen" lets go.
There is peace and simplicity everywhere.
The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.
I can't believe I'm breathing.
Playing is the opposite of working.
And I'm happy.
Something in me dissolves.
A mental door opens and a burst of energy comes in.
And not immediately, but it happens, it happens.
I feel it.
The buzzing slowly comes back.
No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.
Not the buzzing, but a buzz.
And now I feel like I know a magical secret.
But let's stay on the point.
It's love. That's it.
No magic. No secret. Just love.
It's something we've forgotten.
The humming, the work buzz, the titanium humming, that's just the substitute.
When I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself through shows and television hours and how functional my brain is, I have forgotten what the real buzzing is.
The buzz is not a force and it is not work specific.
It depends on joy.
The real buzz depends on love.
The humming is the stream that comes from the lust for life.
The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.
The real buzz ignores the pressures of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.
The real buzz is simple and original.
The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but maybe God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me I was a Titan?
It's just love.
We all need a little more love, a lot more love.
As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.
I make this a fixed rule, so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.
It's law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the buzzing again.
I wish it was that easy. I'm not good at playing, I don't like it.
Playing doesn't suit me the way I work.
The truth hurts,
But I don't like to play.
I always work because I love it.
I'd rather be at work than at home.
This admission is painful, because what kind of person would rather work than be at home?
Well, I do.
Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --
I must have problems.
The fact that I'm too relaxed is not one of them.
We race around in the garden, back and forth, back and forth.
We do small dance parties,
we sing and play ball.
We burst soap bubbles.
I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.
I always reach for my phone.
But it's ok.
My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.
I play and play until I ask myself: Why did we ever stop playing?
You can too! Say yes whenever your child wants to play with you.
Maybe you think I'm naïve, a daydreamer.
You are probably right, but you can do it too!
You have time!
And do you know why? You're not Rihanna or a Muppet show character.
Your child finds you less interesting than you think.
It's only 15 minutes.
My little ones want to play with me for a maximum of 15 minutes until they realize they want to do something else.
It's a wonderful 15 minutes, but only 15 minutes.
After 15 minutes, a ladybug or cookie replaces me.
And if my teenage daughter talks to me for 15 minutes, I'm Mother of the Year.
It's only 15 minutes, that's all it takes.
Anyone can spend 15 minutes at a time, even on a bad mood day!
15 minutes at a time!
No cell phone, no laundry, no distraction.
The day is short: dinners that get the kids ready for bed.
But 15 minutes are in it!
My children are my oasis of well-being, my world. It doesn't have to be the children. It is important to feel the buzzing, to have a place for one's peace of mind.
It's not about playing with your own children. It's about joy,
about "playing" in general.
Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!
Find out what's good for you.
Find out and keep it.
I'm not perfect at it. I fail and I win. Meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --
"Do you want to play?" briefly stands for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show, when I became a titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more.
15 minutes at a time, why not treat yourself to a full 15 minutes?
What could be wrong with that? Nothing!
The buzzing came back in my spare time. The buzzing seems to return when I'm not working.
Working doesn't work without playing.
It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul. It leads me to new ideas. The buzzing has made its way again. I use it to the fullest and love my work again.
I like the buzzing, but I don't love it.
I don't need it.
I am not the humming, the humming is not me ... No more.
Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.
That's my buzz now.
The buzz of life.
The hum of love.
The humming of the work is part of me, but only a part. And for that I am so grateful.
I don't care that I'm a titan. I've never seen a Titan playing Journey to Jerusalem.
I said yes to less work and more games.
And yet I have everything under control. My brain is still functional. My campfires are still burning.
The more I play, the happier I and my children are.
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.
The more I play, the clearer my head is.
The more I play, the better I work.
The more I play, the more I hear the buzzing. The country I create, the marathon I run, the troops, the canvases, the high-pitched sound, the humming, the humming, the other, the right buzz: the hum of life.
The more I feel this buzzing, the more this unusual, trembling, naked and new attitude to life spreads in me. Less titanium -- more me!
The more I feel this buzz, the more I know who I am.
I am an author. I make things up, I bring you to life.
That's part of the job, it means living your dream.
That's the dream of this job,
because a dream job should be a little dreamy.
I said yes to less work and more games.
Titans don't stand a chance here.
"Do you want to play?"
Thank you.
I am a neurosurgeon.
Like most of my colleagues, I deal with human tragedies every day.
I know how your life can change from one second to the next, after a severe stroke or after a car accident.
For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to heal itself.
After a severe injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.
That's probably why I became a functional neurosurgeon.
What is a functional neurosurgeon?
A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions through various surgical measures.
Surely they have heard of one of the best known, "deep brain stimulation". This involves implanting an electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons in such a way that neurological function improves.
It's really an amazing technology. It has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.
Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.
The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.
In my opinion, we are approaching this dream.
I want to show you that we are very close.
With a little help, the brain can help itself.
The story began 15 years ago.
At the time, I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.
I often treated patients with traumatic brain injury.
You have to imagine that in traumatic brain injury, the brain swells and the intracranial pressure increases.
In order to save the life, you have to reduce the intracranial pressure.
For this, you sometimes have to remove part of swollen brain mass.
Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.
What do I mean by that?
We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.
This is not an easy task.
Growing cells from a piece of tissue is similar to very young children being taken out of their families.
You have to find the right nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to make it thrive.
That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.
After many attempts, Jean-François succeeded.
He saw it under his microscope.
That was a big surprise for us.
Why?
It looked exactly like a stem cell culture. With large green cells surrounded by small, immature cells.
You may remember from biology class that stem cells are immature cells that can transform into any cell type in the organism.
The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. They are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.
It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of brain mass in surgery.
We made another fascinating observation: Normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.
They never die, they are immortal.
But these cells behaved differently.
They slowly divided and after a few weeks they even died.
So we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells but behaved differently.
It took us a long time to understand where they came from.
They come from these cells.
These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.
We all have them in our brains.
They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.
They play a very important role in our development.
At the stage of the fetus, they provide for the folding of the brain.
But why do they stay with us?
We don't know.
We believe that they participate in the healing of the brain because we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries.
However, this is not so certain.
But one thing is clear -- it was from these cells that we got our stem cells.
We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.
We had to prove that.
So we decided to develop an experiment.
We wanted to take a piece of brain matter from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.
and then color-code them so that they can be tracked in the brain.
In the last step, we reimplanted them at the collection site of the same individual.
We call this autologous transplantation -- autotransplantation.
One of our first questions was: What happens when we reimplant these cells into normal brain tissue? And what will happen if we reimplant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?
Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.
In the first scenario, we reimplanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely, as if they had been removed again, they go back home. The room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.
In the second scenario, we inflicted an injury and reimplanted the exact same cells, and now the cells were preserved -- they grew into mature neurons.
Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.
These are the cells that have been reimplanted.
The evidence they show is these small dots. These are the cells that we stained in vitro, in culture.
Of course, we couldn't stop here.
Do these cells also help a monkey recover from a brain injury?
So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.
They had to take feed pellets from a tray.
They did that very well.
When they reached a stable level of dexterity, we injured the hand motor skills area in the motor cortex.
As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand.
Just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just like after a stroke.
Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. They recover to some extent, just like in monkeys.
When we were sure that the monkey had reached its level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted its own cells.
On the left side you can see the monkey, which spontaneously recovered.
He can provide about 40% to 50% of his original performance from before the injury.
It is not so precise and not so fast.
Now when we reimplanted the cells, you see: The same monkey, two months after reimplantation.
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.
Since that time, we have found out a lot more about these cells.
We can freeze them and use them later.
We can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.
But our dream is still to implant them in humans.
I really hope that I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.
Thank you very much.
Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think: "I know someone who can use this."
I definitely.
Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start human clinical trials?
Jocelyne Bloch: The biggest obstacles are the authorities. Based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these types of studies.
BG: That's understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.
JB: Yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.
BG: Look to the future -- you completed the research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. If you look further into the future, how many years will it take before someone can get to the hospital, and this therapy will be available.
JB: It's hard to say.
First of all, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.
Will the agency allow us to launch it soon?
Then you have to do this study with a small group of patients.
It takes a long time to select the patients, carry out the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this type of treatment.
After that, you have to apply that to a multicenter study.
You really have to prove that it's useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.
BG: And that it's safe, of course. JB: Of course.
BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and telling us about it.
BG: Thank you very much.
Democracy.
We in the West make a big mistake to take them for granted.
We do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it really is, but as the inventory of our society.
We tend to think of them as an immutable fact.
We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.
That's not true.
Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew and his great imitators in Beijing have proven beyond doubt that it is entirely possible to have thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remain completely undemocratic.
In fact, democracy is dwindling here, in Europe.
Earlier this year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was made abundantly clear to me, as finance minister in the Eurogroup, that our country's democratic process -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece.
At that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Chinese Communist Party, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it changed anything.
At this point, I would like to present to you an economic model for genuine democracy.
I ask you, along with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Chinese Communist Party and even the Eurogroup are succumbing to a mistaken belief that we can save ourselves democracy, but that we need a true and fortified democracy.
Because without democracy, our societies will be meaner, our future bleak, and our great new technologies wasted.
On the subject of waste, I would like to draw your attention to an interesting contradiction that is currently threatening our economies.
I call it the "twin summit paradox."
You are familiar with a summit. They know and recognize it as the mountain of debt that casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world.
We all recognize the mountain of debt,
but few recognize his twin.
A mountain of unused cash that belongs to wealthy savers and corporations, but who are too afraid to invest it where it would be productive and bring in income, with which one could pay off the mountain of debt and also produce all the things that humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.
Let me give you two figures.
In the past 3 months, $3.4 trillion has been invested in the US, England and the Eurozone combined, in all the wealth-producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment, and so on and so forth.
$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money until you compare it to the $5.1 trillion lying around in the same countries and our financial institutions at the same time, doing absolutely nothing but inflating the stock markets and driving up housing prices.
Thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which do not balance each other out by the usual market mechanisms.
The result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of 25-54 year olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently low aggregate demand, which in an endless loop reinforces the pessimism of investors who, fearing low demand, promote it themselves by not investing. Just like Oedipus' father, who, fearing that the oracle's prophecy might come true, that his son would kill him when he grew up,
Unintentionally brings about the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.
This is my quarrel with capitalism --
his extremely lavish manner. All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and, above all, fund all the technologies, "green" technologies, that are crucial to saving the earth.
So is democracy the solution?
I think so. But before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?
Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor control the government as the majority.
Athenian democracy, of course, excluded too many --
Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.
However, it would be a mistake to diminish the status of Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions.
The crucial thing about Athenian democracy was and is that it included the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more importantly and crucially, that it gave them the right to political participation with equal voting weight in matters of state affairs.
Athenian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines very brightly, it is also burned out quickly.
However, today's liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens.
but in Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.
While Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and empowered the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a charter for rulers.
For liberal democracy emerged only when a complete separation of politics and economics became possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- that is, the corporate world -- became a democracy-free zone.
In our democracies today, since this separation of politics and economics began, there has been a relentless struggle between the two, with economics gradually infiltrating politics and disempowering it.
Do you wonder why politicians are not as they used to be?
It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.
It's because nowadays you can be in government and still not in power because power has migrated from politics to business and the areas are separate.
I mentioned my quarrel with capitalism.
When you think about it, it's kind of like a herd of predators that has decimated the animals it feeds on so sustainably that it ends up starving to death.
It is similar with the economy, which has cannibalized politics to such an extent that it harms itself through the self-inflicted economic crisis. Corporate power is growing, political goods are being devalued, inequality is rising, aggregate demand is falling, and corporate executives are too scared to invest their companies' cash.
The more successfully capitalism drives the "demos" [the people] out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks become, and the greater the waste of human labor and the prosperity of humanity.
If this is true, it is obvious that we need to bring politics and economics back together, and it would be better if the "demos" remained in control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.
By the way, this is not a new idea.
The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it didn't end very well.
The lesson of the Soviet debacle should be that only miraculously can the working poor regain a position like in ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of brutality and waste.
But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!
Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.
The problem is, as long as economics and politics are separate spheres, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it will happen -- very soon, I believe -- in countries like China.
So we have to reshape the economy and reunite the economic and political spheres, taking care that we democratize the reunified sphere, otherwise we end up in a pathological surveillance hyperautocracy that makes the film "The Matrix" seem like a documentary.
So the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical gains it has produced.
the more interesting question is whether capitalism will be replaced by a dystopia similar to the one in "The Matrix", or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek", in which machines serve humans and humans put their energy into exploring the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "agora", indulging in the meaning of life in long conversations.
I think we can be optimistic.
So what would it take, what could it look like to have this "Star Trek"-like utopia instead of the "Matrix"-like dystopia?
In practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples, very briefly.
In the corporate space, imagine a capital market where you make money while you work, and where your capital follows you from one job to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you work -- is owned by those who currently work in the company.
Then all income comes from capital and proceeds and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated.
No more differentiation between those who own the companies but do not work in them and employees who work there but do not own the company. No more tug-of-war between capital and labor, no big gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no towering twin peaks.
In the realm of global political economy, imagine for a moment that our national currencies have a floating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of 20 Largest Emerging Economies], in the interest of all humanity.
Imagine, furthermore, that all world trade is traded in this currency -- let's call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to that country's trade deficit or surplus into a common fund.
Also imagine that this fund invests in "green" technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are scarce.
This is not a new idea.
It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.
The problem was that at that time you didn't have the technical means to implement it.
Today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy.
The world I am describing to you is at once libertarian, in which it favors privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labor in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.
But above all, it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.
Will we awaken in such a world
or will we sink into a "matrix"-like dystopia?
The answer depends on how we decide politically together.
It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Yanis ...
You describe yourself in your biography as a libertarian Marxist.
How relevant is Marx's analysis today?
Yanis Varoufakis: If anything I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.
The reason for the reunification of politics and business is ... If we don't, technological development will produce such a massive decline in aggregate demand in what Larry Summers calls "long-term stagnation."
By transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will destabilize not only our democracies, but also those countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.
If this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant.
like Hayek, that's why I'm a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I'm completely confused.
BG: Indeed, and now we probably are.
YV: If you're not confused, you don't think enough.
BG: That's a very Greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: Actually, it was Einstein who said that. BG: In your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China, and yesterday at the speakers' dinner you said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China.
Would you like to repeat it here?
YV: There is a lot of hypocrisy.
In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of a democracy.
As I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it happens -- the economic sphere -- is a completely democracy-free zone.
In some ways, if I may say so provocatively, China today resembles 19th century England.
Because -- remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically.
Liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --
he was particularly sceptical about democratic development.
What you can see now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the Industrial Revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.
Accusing China now of doing what the West itself did in the 19th century smacks of hypocrisy.
BG: I'm sure many listeners are curious about your experience as Greece's finance minister earlier this year.
YV: I sensed that was coming.
BG: Yes...
How do you look back on the first half of the year six months later?
YV: Very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a fresh start with the eurozone.
not only Greece, but the eurozone,
namely, to say goodbye to complacency and the constant denial that a massive fault line has run through the euro area, and continues to run, which is massively threatening the development of the entire European Union.
We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which, by the way, was the first proposal to reveal this denial --
To do it right. Unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the Europgroup, have continued to choose denial.
But you know what's coming.
This is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to keep alive an economic system that is not viable through political will and authoritarianism, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when change happens, it happens abruptly and destructively.
BG: What change do you foresee?
YV: There is no doubt that the eurozone has no future unless we change its structure.
BG: Did you make any mistakes during your time as Minister of Finance?
YV: Every day.
BG: For example? YV: Anyone who looks back -- Seriously...
If there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims that he has not made a mistake, then that is a dangerous person.
Of course I made mistakes.
The biggest mistake was to sign the request to extend the debt program at the end of February.
I believed that there was a genuine interest on the part of the donors to find a common solution.
But there wasn't.
They just wanted to bring down our government just because they didn't want to deal with the turmoil that ran through the eurozone.
They did not want to admit that they had been running a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.
We lost a third of our nominal GDP.
There is worse than during the "Great Depression".
None of the troika of donors who imposed this policy on us admitted: "That was a colossal mistake."
BG: Despite all this, and despite the aggressive tone of the talks, you still seem to be quite pro-European.
YV: Absolutely.
My criticism of the European Union and the eurozone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe.
My biggest fear is that the eurozone will not survive.
Because if it does not survive, the centrifugal forces released will be demonic and destroy the European Union.
This will have catastrophic consequences not only for Europe, but for the entire global economy.
We are probably the strongest economy in the world.
If we allow ourselves to take the path of a postmodern 1930, as it seems to me, it will be as detrimental to the future of Europeans as it is for non-Europeans.
BG: We very much hope that you are wrong on this point.
Yanis, thank you very much for being at TED.
YV: Thank you.
Most have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.
Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.
This goes back to the decision Roy made three years ago.
Roy Price is a senior executive at Amazon Studios,
of Amazon's TV production company.
He is 47 years old, slim, has a hedgehog hairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as "movies, TV, technology, tacos".
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for choosing the shows and content that Amazon will produce.
Of course, this is a very competitive industry.
There are already so many TV shows that Roy can't pick just one.
He has to find shows that are very, very good.
In other words, he needs to find shows that are on the far right of that bend.
This curve is the rating distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. The rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating.
If your show is rated nine or higher, it will be a winner.
Then you have a successful show.
These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the addictive shows where, after watching a season, your brain asks, "Where are more of these episodes?"
This kind of show.
On the left, here at this end, are shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at that end of the curve.
Roy Price doesn't worry about getting on the left side of the corner, because I think you need special intelligence to beat Toddlers and Tiaras.
He's more concerned about the middle bulge, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they just don't excite.
So he has to make sure he's really on the right side.
The pressure is there, and of course it's the first time Amazon has done something like this, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything.
He wants to create success.
He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.
He takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online where everyone can watch them for free.
And if Amazon gives things out for free, you grab it, right?
Millions of viewers watch these episodes.
However, they do not know that they are being watched while watching these shows.
They are watched by Roy and his team, who record everything.
They record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you skip or watch again.
They collect millions of pieces of data to then use that data to decide which show to produce.
In fact, they collect the data, process it, and that's the answer, which is, "Amazon should do a sitcom about four Republican U.S. senators."
They did this show.
Does anyone know the name of this show?
Yes, "Alpha House", but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.
It's just an average show -- literally-- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a little above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were working towards.
Around the same time at another company, another manager put on a top show through data analysis. His name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, Netflix's programming manager. Just like Roy, he's always looking to find that one super show and he also uses data for that, but he does it a little differently.
Instead of running a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data about Netflix viewers, i.e. the ratings they give the shows, their history, which shows they like, etc.
Then they use this data to find out these little details about viewers: which shows they like, which producers, which actors.
When they had all the parts together, they took a risk and decided not to make a sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about one senator.
Do you know this show?
Yes, "House of Cards". Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.
"House of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. So exactly where they wanted to go.
Of course, the question now is: What happened here?
You have two very competitive, data-savvy companies.
They connect all this data together and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.
Why is that?
Because the logic kind of says that this should work for everything.
When you collect millions of pieces of data for a decision you make, you should be able to make a good decision.
You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.
It is optimized by very powerful computers.
The least you can expect is good TV, right?
If data analysis doesn't work that way, it's a bit scary because we're living in a time where we're turning more and more to statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television.
Does anyone here know the company Multi-Health Systems?
Nobody. Ok, that's even good.
Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. If you come into contact with it, you are in prison.
If someone is in jail here in the U.S. asking for release, it's likely that that company's data analysis will be used to determine whether or not a release will be made.
Just like Amazon and Netflix. But instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, deciding whether a person will be good or bad.
Mediocre TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.
Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the large amount of data,
does not always produce the best results. That's not because a company like Multi-Health Systems doesn't know how to use data.
Even the most data-savvy companies are sometimes wrong.
Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.
In 2009, Google announced that they could use data analysis to predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind -- by analyzing data from Google research.
It worked wonderfully and was a huge news sensation. The success culminated in a publication in the journal "Nature".
It worked perfectly, year after year after year, until suddenly it stopped working,
And no one could say why.
It simply did not work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the journal "Nature".
Even the most data-savvy companies like Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.
Despite all these errors, data is increasingly pouring into life's decisions -- in the workplace, in law enforcement, in medicine.
So we'd better make sure that data is helpful.
I, too, know many difficulties with data. I work in computational genetics -- an area where some very smart people use an unimaginable amount of data to make serious decisions, like choosing cancer therapy.
or the development of a drug. Over the years, I've seen some patterns about the difference between making successful decisions based on data and unsuccessful decisions. This pattern should be disseminated.
If you ever need to solve a complex problem, you do two main things:
First, break down this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyze the individual parts; Secondly, put the individual parts back together to make a decision.
Sometimes you have to do this several times, but it's always two things: take apart and put back together.
And now the most important thing: Data and data analysis are only good for the first part.
Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help break down a problem and understand its parts.
They are not suitable for putting the parts back together and then coming to a decision.
There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.
If there's one thing the brain is good at, it's putting pieces and pieces back together, even if the information is incomplete, to make a good decision -- especially if it's an expert's brain.
That's why I think Netflix has been so successful, because they've used data and brains where they belong in the process.
They use data to better understand their audience, which they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do. But the decision on how to take all these pieces, put them back together and turn them into a show like "House of Cards" wasn't in the data.
Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant they were taking a huge personal risk with this decision.
Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.
They used data to guide all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas, then when they chose "Alpha House" as their show.
It was a safe decision because they could always say, "That's what the data tells us."
It did not lead to the desired result.
Data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things go wrong when data starts to drive our decisions.
No matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and not to forget, this device is quite useful.
Many of you will ...
Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.
Many know it.
It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". It's amazing. For decisions based on a yes or no question, you only have to shake the ball to get an answer. "Most likely" -- right here at this moment.
I'll fight it out later with a tech demo.
I've made a few decisions in my life so far, and I should have listened to the ball afterwards.
But, as you know, of course, when you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, like data analysis, to make better decisions.
But this does not change the basic structure.
So maybe the ball will be smarter and smarter and smarter. Ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right-hand corner.
And I find this very encouraging news that despite the amount of data, it still pays to make decisions, be an expert at what you do, and take risks.
Because in the end, it's not the data, but the risks that land you at the right end of the curve.
Thank you.
