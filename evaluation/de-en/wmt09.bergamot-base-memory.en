The Prague Stock Exchange plunges into negative territory against the close of business.
After the steep waste in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange was able to correct the losses.
Transactions with ČEZ's shares reached almost half of normal day-to-day trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued Monday's slump at the start of Tuesday's operations, when it fell by another six percentage points.
This time, the reason for the slump was on Wall Street.
In the Czech Republic, too, the market’s response to the result of the vote of the American House of Representatives, which had refused to support a stabilization plan for the financial sector there, is thus evident.
Case of shares in Asia
Shares in the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic case on Tuesday, although the indices were able to make up for some of the losses during the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Stock Exchange index lost nearly four percentage points over the course of the business day, but was later able to make up for some of the losses, thus reducing the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which monitors the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, while in Shanghai, markets were closed.
Shares on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent but then reduced losses to 4.3 percent.
The stock market in Taiwan fell 3.6 percent, according to the index there.
"The timing for the bailout in the U.S. is uncertain and will affect financial markets worldwide," Hong Kong chief executive Joseph Yam said in a statement.
Hong Kong, although it belongs to China, determines its own monetary policy, that is, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
Interest rates in Hong Kong are at the same level as those in the United States.
American lawmakers should return to the negotiating table as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and pass the draft support for the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that other countries would also be affected by the slump.
A bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected the plan for support for the financial system, for which up to 700 billion dollars (nearly 12 trillion Kč) should be spent.
Lawmakers thus ignored President George Bush's request to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and thus help stabilize the entire economy.
American stocks experienced a bloodbath on Monday, and major stock indices saw the biggest slump in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, a similar slump it had last recorded in 1987.
The index had already fallen before the vote, but there were hardly any signs that the draft would not get through in the House of Representatives, the index experienced a free fall.
Congress makes concession: U.S. government may pump 700 billion dollars into banks
The top representatives of the American Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush has agreed on a broader form of a deal on financial assistance to the American financial system.
It is due to be voted on early next week.
American lawmakers made a breakthrough in talks on the passage of a rescue plan in the form of financial assistance to the American financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars (about 12 trillion crowns).
However, this does not mean a victory.
Congressmen have yet to negotiate some details of the agreement before they are allowed to publish and vote on the final version of the law.
The plan to support the financial system will be negotiated in the U.S. Congress on Monday.
On Sunday, the chairman of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to different data, the plan could probably be voted on on Wednesday at the earliest.
According to economists, a notice that the plan will be adopted should be the first significant psychological factor in reviving financial markets.
After that, however, there is a "disillusionment" due to the complicated mechanisms, as could be helped in the markets in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made significant progress.
We have clarified our differing views on what a package to stabilize the market should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
According to her words, there could still be a final vote on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on the night of Sunday to give the government fund its final form.
This provides for a purchase of unsellable mortgage assets from the financial companies, which plunge the financial firms into heavy losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.
You have to continue the recovery plan, but I think we are at our destination," Paulson said.
A signal for Asian business
The global financial crisis is also clearly reflected in the stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to the words of the Democratic Senator of Nevada, Harry Reid, the lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement before Sunday in Congress.
This is to reassure investors before doing business in the Asian financial markets, which are in the first time zone, where a decision of the Congress could influence the business on Monday.
But it is not yet clear when both chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, but there is also uncertainty about whether the negotiations at the last minute could not fail on a problem.
Lawmakers hope it will be passed in the next few days.
But the law will still undergo some changes.
The total amount intended to help the system should be divided into two parts.
The initial 350 billion dollars is to be provided as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the distribution of the remaining money if it has the impression that the program does not fulfil its function, at another 100 billion dollars and later the final 350 billion dollars.
Bush positively evaluates progress in negotiations
The president has veto power in this decision, but Congress can overrule his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program has remained, which was based on gaining finance for buying off bad mortgage securities whose value has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are no longer able to repay their mortgages.
"We worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday, the Senate then on Monday," according to Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush was also satisfied with the progress.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and "assesses the mutual effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy."
Restriction of golden parachutes
The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee Christopher Dodd, the senior negotiator, said that lawmakers had agreed on a responsibility for the money program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the completion of perks and a timetable for financing the plan.
The new law is also intended to restrict the so-called golden parachutes for directors of the companies involved in the programme and shall set up a committee to which supervision of the fund is to be held.
This is to be headed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and made a major advance towards an agreement that works and is important for the market and for all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also anticipates help for homeowners who have trouble repaying their mortgage.
The government should negotiate new rates on mortgages it buys up, with the goal of cutting the monthly cost to the debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological Help
The proposed plan is a good idea, according to the main economist of Patria Finance David Marek, but implementation will be very difficult.
"This is because you do not know by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets are bought up.
That will be crucial to how the financial sector and the government split the losses among themselves," Marek told the iHNed.cz server this week.
Whether the plan will be adopted now or early next week is not decisive, according to Marek.
"Much more important is that congressmen agree to support the plan and that they say goodbye to it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement on the fact that it comes to a farewell is the most important thing at this moment," Marek stressed.
Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, overall they come to 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the early parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the previous chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the verge.
In contrast, the election director of the alliance for the future of Austria (BZÖ), the Carinthian state governor Jörg Haider, is gearing up for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest force in the country with 29.8 percent of the vote, but compared to the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the vote.
The ÖVP scored even worse, which loses almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially with the People's Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP had withdrawn from the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advantage over the SPÖ.
Voters, however, have probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results, there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party's executive board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the election debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of the SPÖ and ÖVP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Liberals (FPÖ) provisionally received 18 percent, the BZÖ eleven percent of the votes - but at the same time expressed their fear that the year 1999 could be repeated when the People's Party had made agreements with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still uniform, in 2005 it split from the BZÖ) with regard to a joint government, which had even imposed sanctions on the part of the European Union
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with each party, is obviously counting on this development and expects to return to Vienna in Austrian federal policy.
The Green Party also entered the parliament, but it suffered slight losses and slipped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four percent hurdle and therefore did not move into parliament.
Duel on knife's edge: MP3 player against mobile phones.
We advise you on your choice
While almost every phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls yet.
Therefore, of course, it looks like it is better to buy only one phone.
In spite of everything, there are enough reasons why you should get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the type of use and the claims of the future owner.
I'm sure you'll hardly buy a great expensive turntable for home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
Once, such musical novelties do not appear on LPs, and from a qualitative point of view, there is no objective reason for this either.
However, if you have LPs with art rock, jazz or blues on the shelf, you probably at least dream of one.
So it is also with the music on the road, i.e. with compressed music, in simple terms - music in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it may not be acceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, but a Pink Floyd fan will hardly be able to handle headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The selection is wide-ranging.
The life of the batteries is also crucial.
Some good music players can play much more than just music, but what phones can do don't even make them happy.
No modern device is as universal as the phone.
In addition to the primary functions, the phone and the texting, it can play music and videos, record both, it has a better, sometimes a worse camera and may also be able to navigate.
And if you still include the smartphones and communicators, you almost have a small computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and not photograph a TV.
But the universality of mobile phones also has disadvantages.
However, the more features you use on your phone, the more often you will need to reload it.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy guzzlers.
Only a few mobile phones can play music for more than ten-twelve hours, usually it is much less.
In this respect, music players (especially the simplest) are significantly more powerful.
That’s why you should expect cheap phones to be able to play music for more than a few hours.
If you still make a phone call from time to time, you prefer to buy a charger for the office for safety - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the less good ones can withstand at least 9 hours of continuous operation with one time charging.
Another problem is if you want to transfer the music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a small part of the devices has a USB end, in addition, not every mobile phone can be connected directly to a PC without special software.
Of course, you can overplay the music directly to a storage medium, but only a few card readers can be finished without reduction with the tiny memory cards that are used in mobile phones.
With exceptions (iPod), you do not need any special software for players.
You only need to feed the device from your PC via USB port with music.
Most mobile phones and players create a music library themselves, ordered by the name of the artist, the title of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating by users.
Some devices only map the tree structure of the address directory, similar to Windows Explorer, some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smart phones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobile phones can do more
When choosing a specific device, you should inquire in particular about the service life of the battery, the storage capacity, the quality and the type of sound and of course also the ease of use.
If music is above all a backdrop for you and you only listen to it every day, for example in the tram, then any mobile phone that plays MP3 files is enough.
Which can really be almost any phone.
You also don’t have to control which music formats a mobile phone or a player can process.
MP3 will all create, and most of the music you get will be in this format right now.
The format is one of the most common, and most devices can also play music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (a format that Apple and its iPods use).
Better phones also allow the purchase of music online.
You only have to access the corresponding pages of a provider (or another provider) via mobile Internet, and you can buy a song or album.
This service can already be a striking argument in itself for why you should get a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of the providers is bad and is usually limited to fast radio hits.
Prices are not the lowest either.
In general, however, it is assumed that this type of sale of music (whether it will be via GSM, Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry the mobile phone with them.
If you feel like listening to something, reach for the phone in your jacket pocket while the player is lying at home forgotten.
However, it depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least a wireless hands-free device.
If not, you can access the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the fewest MP3 players.
Probably the biggest advantage of music phones will be in the price for many.
The cheapest usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
For three and four thousand crowns you already get a very decent Walkman.
The biggest handicap for most will be that there are no regular headphones.
The best and most technically mature phones with a 3.5 mm opening for regular headphones cost up to fifteen thousand crowns.
The advantage of the players is in turn the easy operation.
The easiest - and not necessarily cheapest (see selection) - player can really serve anyone.
A minimum of functions, the similarity in operation with the formerly normal cassette recorder or, for example, the turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of a collision in the form of an erroneously employed mobile Internet and a subsequently horrendous invoice for data transmissions.
What device should you use
Also the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. B. Vodafone 527) usually has a slot for replaceable storage media (type M2, microSD &. them.).
Even if you buy a corresponding card, two thousand crowns are enough.
But beware.
The basic models usually only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB.
Only the most expensive can also read 8 GB memory cards.
If you already own a mobile phone and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, then reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to put more than 1100 crowns on the table.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you prefer to take specialized mobile phones - Walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some from Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have standalone control knobs for MP3, and the ease of use thus comes close to that of a single MP3 player.
The furthest here is Sony Ericsson, whose phones from the Walkman series have the same user interface as the individually sold MP3 players.
The same services in the same price category of up to four thousand crowns, but with a higher storage capacity (up to 16 GB) and a long battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours) will provide you with MP3 players from the above-mentioned manufacturers.
The first virtual provider is already coming to the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite mature, the Czech providers offer virtually all services, as they are also offered by their partners in Western Europe.
Still, something is missing here - a virtual provider that forces the classic ones to lower prices.
Maybe this one won't be long in coming.
The fact that the Czech mobile operators work among the most expensive in Europe in the first place, we have often reported on Mobil.cz.
By the way, this was also confirmed by the telecommunications authority ČTÚ, which drew attention to the fact that the price of a text message here is higher than in the rest of the European Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the area of regulation of roaming fees, there is likely to be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of the Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that really makes a battle announcement.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, in the Czech Republic there are three mobile networks and a penetration of far more than 100%.
The mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that there is extremely much competition in the Czech market.
This is often agreed by the chairman of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák, who in the past had often stated that there was no room for another provider in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a classic provider with its own network no longer has a lot of chances (by the way, it would probably hardly find frequencies).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual provider.
Especially the entry of virtual providers into the mobile market brought a significant price reduction, to which the classic mobile operators had to react.
Even before the entry of such companies as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the market in the UK, there were similar voices as in the Czech Republic.
However, it has been shown that there is room for such providers and that they can be truly successful.
By the way, you don’t need to look for examples for long.
In February this we reported on the launch of the virtual provider Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this provider managed to attract more than 100 thousand customers and thus become the fifth largest provider in the country.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which owns U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual providers is that you can focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to function effectively, virtual providers need much fewer customers than a classic provider.
They do not need a relatively high cost of building, operating and maintaining a mobile network.
In the world, the virtual providers usually profile themselves as low-cost companies - they offer cheap telephone conversations and SMS, which is often accompanied by a less extensive range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
However, as the example of mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a rather good move to rely on a non-clichéd target group.
This provider is specifically aimed at men.
"Real guys choose Mobilking - the provider they like and can trust," said David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, the operating company of this virtual provider.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could also gain a foothold in the Czech Republic.
Vodafone press officer Miroslav Čepický also doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a market segment on which most virtual providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of services."
In the Czech Republic without chance, the mobile operators think
However, it is almost certain that if a virtual mobile operator conquers the Czech Republic, this will not be mobile king.
"While we are talking about an expansion of this successful project, the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not particularly hopeful.
There will be more of a market entry of Mobilking in other countries of our region," says in a telephone conversation for Mobil.cz Jana Studničková, press officer of the financial group Penta.
Indirectly, it confirmed that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic are not particularly inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible to ensure that no potential competitor is created.
The GTS Novera Group, which wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers, has been showing their interest in launching a virtual mobile provider for a long time.
"We have a great interest in offering our customers not only fixed-line but also mobile telecom services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated with all Czech mobile operators about this possibility.
With some of them, we have already been able to achieve negotiation progress," said the press spokesman for the Pavel Kaidl group.
Maybe better times are coming now.
From non-official information, it emerges that the first virtual provider may be expected by the end of the year.
So far, however, this is surrounded by an insurmountable wall of silence.
"At this moment, we do not assume that there is room for a full-fledged virtual provider in the Czech Republic.
The Czech market has large specifics compared to other markets.
So far, no subject has approached us with a complex and serious project in this area," says Vlastimil Sršeň from the press department of Telefónica O2 in his statement for Mobil.cz.
The specifics of the Czech market are also indicated by other providers.
T-Mobile's press secretary Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "So far, we have not yet found a viable and mutually beneficial project to build on."
And she adds: "On T-Mobile's network, hardly a virtual provider will emerge by the end of the year.
At this moment we would have to have a concrete offer in order to be able to think at such short notice."
Vodafone is more focused on meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav Čepický comments: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual providers, especially in the area of sharing of costs and infrastructure.
This is precisely what we consider the best from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for a fast mobile internet.”
The responsible authorities - with the providers hand in hand
The approach of the mobile providers is easy to understand, another provider would mean more competition, this would lead to falling prices and thus also to a decline in profits.
So why should such a competitor be made easier to enter the market?
The fact that the providers can pull together when it comes to something also proves the long back and forth about the emergence of U:fon.
Probably the strongest pressure in the direction of ČTÚ was currently when U:fon was launched, from the company T-Mobile.
This is also evidenced by the publicly available information from the ČTÚ websites.
But now U:fon is just an argument why you should not allow a virtual provider.
Martina Kemrová commented: "The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has also recently been strengthened by the market entry of a fourth mobile operator.
Taking into account the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that a new player would place high demands on the market itself and, above all, its services."
However, given this approach by mobile operators, the absolute disinterest of Czech regulators is surprising.
This is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ, which unfortunately - in contrast to the UK and other highly developed countries - does not have the competence to intervene in economic competition in Czech Republic.
This has only the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, referred to this entire problem his very typical attitude.
"The entry of a virtual mobile operator would then be possible after a contract between a mobile operator and a virtual provider via the rental of the necessary infrastructure has occurred.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, because the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the classic providers," said Kristián Chalupa from the ÚOHS Department of External Relations in his reply to our request.
Such a formulation would not be surprising from representatives of the providers.
From an authority that is to represent consumer interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market, this is more than questionable.
In particular, when Kristián adds Chalupa: "Abroad, where virtual providers work quite normally, it can be observed that their entry into the market has contributed to a price reduction in mobile telephone services."
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market and a price reduction are probably not among the interests of the ÚOHS.
What is really shocking about this case is the almost touching harmony of the three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence is obvious.
Just as the absolutely same price of petrol at the petrol stations is certainly just coincidence and the result of a fierce competition.
"The Authority has not discovered any signs in this matter that indicate action contrary to competition, and thus it has no reason to intervene in the matter in any way.
None of the providers has a dominant market position, so they do not have the corresponding increased responsibility for their actions on the market.
The necessary instruments for opening up the mobile phone market to virtual providers are also likely to be lacking for the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority," Chalupa said in a statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of many contentious points.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets, elaborated by the ČTÚ, after which telecommunications is a single market from the point of view of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech mobile operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - for the market entry of a virtual provider, the approval of the network operator is always necessary.
And the mobile operator has - logically - the monopoly for its network.
This means that it necessarily assumes a dominant position in a particular segment.
However, even if you do not go along with this argument, it should at least be a warning for the ÚOHS that three mobile operators are strikingly similar.
Complaints from a number of interested parties (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) prove that they encounter very similar obstacles in negotiations with all providers.
The transfer of responsibility to the ČTÚ is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications services, with which the ÚOHS distances itself from the whole matter.
This has been observed in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been possible to promote the extension of the ČTÚ’s competences to the field of economic competition in telecommunications in the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, although a number of experts had promised to improve the situation.
The representatives of the ÚOHS must know this all too well, but they probably have other interests.
It's possible when no one is looking
The functioning of some pseudo-virtual providers remains unnoticed, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
It is companies that issue their own price lists for mobile telecommunications services, but which are only partially public.
Normally, they are companies that operate in the field of multilevel marketing.
Own mobile phone services offer, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and others.
The price lists of these companies usually only reach selected ones.
The joke of the matter is that the company performs opposite the operator as a classic corporate customer who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer, he then receives special price offers (and other offers).
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar resale.
"Should there be any cases you describe, then it may be a violation of the contractual terms that we will then deal with, which can lead to a termination of cooperation with the relevant company," Martina Kemrová replied to our question about this issue.
However, it is quite unlikely that such a thing will not spread to those responsible for the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, they can be thousands of customers.
However, no operator opposes such a procedure.
From the activities of these companies, they do not have to be neglected profits, at the same time they are - in contrast to the actual virtual providers - not affected by the actual official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický draws attention to possible problems: "The law allows such types of speculation, despite everything, the services of these companies are only used by a very small percentage of customers.
They must also accept that the SIM card in their phone does not run in their name, so they cannot fully have it like the normal customers of the mobile operators."
But that alone should seem strange to the ČTÚ.
Another question opens up for the ÚOHS.
If the mobile operators turn a blind eye to such a procedure, why lock themselves against a virtual provider?
It should be added that the ÚOHS has quite strong competences to uncover such activities, and if it does not want to, it does not have to be satisfied with the declaration of the providers that they do not know about it and that their terms and conditions would prohibit this.
When Czech Republic is no longer the most expensive
As has already been emphasized several times in the text, the entry of the market of virtual providers brought with it a significant drop in the price of the various services.
Virtually all countries where virtual providers have emerged have tried to prevent the creation of virtually more or less.
The arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too small or too saturated, problems with the quality of services, etc.
In the highly developed countries, however, it was precisely at these moments that the regulatory bodies intervened, which by no means tried to safeguard the interests of the mobile operators, but those of their customers.
Be it through formal measures or non-formal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created, and this was followed by more.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies are throwing themselves up the whole case like a hot potato.
Based on our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguity in competences is more than favorable in these cases.
But let's not throw the shotgun in the grain.
If the background information is correct and a virtual provider soon appears, the Czech mobile market may soon be moving again.
If a provider allows the creation of a virtual mobile carrier, the ÚOHS will not remain idle when it comes to rejecting (discriminating against) other interested parties.
And the Czechs will finally no more more more on the phone than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Find the best
Listen to the four versions of the new Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek presented the new recordings of the national anthem Where is my home country in a ceremony.
The hymn was newly recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available - with male or female solo singing, in choral version and in an instrumental version.
The vocal version was taken over by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The editors of the hymn versions are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
For Bělohlávek, the Czech national song is one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier, he had told Czech Radio that he had selected singers with young, representative voices for the solo variants, which are striking and popular.
"From the beginning, I tried to maintain a clear diction for both and then also with the choir, so that you understand the text well, so that a harmony arises," the conductor said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year. Jubilee.
The song Kde domov můj first sounded on the stage of the Estates Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl, the music was by František Škroup.
It became popular, and people took it spontaneously.
The first verse of the song became an organic component of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What does the "new" anthem sound like
The Prague transport companies will also be transporting to a chip for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, the 1. October 2008, will go down in the history of Prague transport companies as a date on which the first passengers board a subway, tram or bus carrying an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
These can currently buy about one hundred thousand people who own the chip card Opencard.
Passengers can enjoy a 30-day, 90-day or annual coupon (valued from 1. January 2009) buy and have it played on their chip card at the same time, in the information centres and branches of the transport companies at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The coupons are also available via the Internet on the website of the transport companies www.dpp.cz since yesterday.
The service was used by over four hundred customers until the afternoon hours.
Those who use the Internet sale can really forget the output window in the subway stations, where they have had to wait regularly in long lines for their paper tickets.
You buy the coupon via the Internet, which is played on the open card in one of the thirteen branches of the city library.
"At these points, there is also a switch with trained staff available to the travelers, which advises interested parties on the Internet purchase and also plays the coupon on the map," according to the spokesman of the project Martin Opatrný.
In addition to the libraries, you can also play the electronic coupons on the open card at self-service machines, which are attached to some subway vestibules.
What do such machines look like?
They are red, reminiscent of ticket devaluers, the passengers may already have them in the metro stations Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská noticed.
"Currently there are five of them in the city, but by the end of the year it should be eighty," adds Opatrný.
The coupon is controlled by a machine instead of the driver
The operation of the machines, which will work from tomorrow, is easy.
You only have to insert the chip card, and the previously purchased coupon plays itself up.
The electronic coupons will apply from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the surrounding area.
So in the suburban trains and on the bus lines with the numbers 300 to 499, with which mainly the inhabitants from municipalities of the region of Central Bohemia reach the capital.
"In the trains belonging to the Prague integrated traffic, the train attendants have reading devices with which they can check the validity period of the coupons according to time and zone," explains Filip Drápal of the organization Ropid the ticket control. This organization compiles the timetables for the Prague transport companies.
The suburban buses have card readers at the checkout at the driver's.
When boarding, the chip card must not only be presented to the driver, but the open card must be placed at a marked point on the side of the cash register.
The driver thus checks the validity of the coupons played.
"If a passenger wants to check the validity of the coupons played on, nothing is easier than to ask the driver for this information," Drápal said.
A passenger who does not drive with suburban buses and no longer knows when the validity of the coupon will end can in turn go to the self-service machines, where the coupons are played on the card.
Here, the information on the validity of his documents is displayed on the display of the device.
The Sudeten demanded a referendum from the United States
The Sudeten Germans had asked in 1945 for the annexation of the Bohemian Forest to the United States.
This is evident from a letter stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the auspices of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans are said to have turned to the US President in 1945.
This is evident, among other things, from a letter that has been preserved in a private archive and which is now kept in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans of Krumau ask the American president in the letter that he should not allow the return of the "Sudetengau" - which was taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and really want to be sure of the words that the American units are not entering German territory as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," reads a letter signed with the words "people who care about the fate of the Sudets."
Since the annexation to Czechoslovakia suggests that the Sudeten Germans - in the knowledge of the Czech national character - would expect brutality, recklessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American President to take over the protection of the Bohemian Forest for today and forever.
"We cannot believe that, regardless of the view of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you are giving this area to a foreign state that is oppressing and eliminating minorities, and has contributed nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly the fear of revenge of the "Czech oppressors".
If the US President had doubts about the attitude of the Bohemian Forest Germans, it would be sufficient if he initiated a referendum in the Bohemian Forest Gauh about whether the inhabitants wanted to become part of the USA or live under the rule of protection of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound somewhat naïve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, it paints a good picture in the opinion of some contemporary witnesses with regard to the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at that time.
Even if the Bohemian Germans at least suspected that one would negotiate about their deportation from the republic, only a few of them even admitted such a possibility.
Some waited for the United States and Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Still others believed they could simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who is from Budweis.
He was in the war as Budweiser German in the Navy on the Baltic Sea.
When he came to British captivity at the end of the war and he was taken to a prisoner-of-war camp in Holstein, dozens more Bohemian Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that if they came home, the Czech would suit them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners of war who had lived in Czechoslovakia before the war, reckoned, in his opinion, that he would be expelled from the republic on the basis of the Beneš decrees.
Don't you think - then pay!
An emotionally charged campaign is aimed at motorists
Most expensive action for safety on the streets in Czech history.
This would also be the case in characterising the emotionally charged media campaign that the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
Minister Aleš Řebíček’s authority expects to dissuade drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The campaign for 150 million crowns will be on TV, on the radio, in the cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
It is intended to dissuade drivers from driving too fast and alcohol at the wheel.
And they also remember to strap on before driving.
The campaign mainly wants to talk to young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers in conscience.
And what is shown in the spots?
Especially stories of people who appeal to emotions.
This is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the whole campaign:
Don't you think - then pay!
The words "don't think" are in capital letters on a license plate.
And in a pool of blood, the word "pay" is written.
This means that you can pay a moment of inattention with your own life.
The spots will "shock" viewers until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can see pictures with drastic shots of accident victims.
It is expected that the number of accidents and the number of traffic fatalities on the Czech roads will decrease.
The spots were compiled by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar bread and whip for motorists
"For the drivers, the motto is carrot and whip.
Sugar bread means that if they drive at red, for example, they save time.
The whip is then the threat of a penalty or an accident.
The driver must be reminded of the risk," according to the traffic psychologist of the hospital Na Homolce Martin Kořán.
And that is why information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising are necessary, says the psychologist.
In his opinion, even less effective are panels that alert drivers to a danger.
"If you put up a static board that warns of a danger, it will probably soon flow with the environment, and the drivers will no longer notice it," says Kořán.
Olmert would return almost all occupied territories in exchange for peace
The chairman of the provisional Israeli government Ehud Olmert has advocated the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Jordanian, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, if peace with Palestine and Syria can be made in exchange for this.
He emphasized this in an interview printed Monday by the daily Jediot Achronot.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means it becomes necessary to return almost all (occupied) territories, if not all," Olmert told the newspaper.
"We retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to cede a similarly high percentage (Israeli territory) to the Palestinians, because there will be no peace without this," he added.
He acknowledged that a possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
"The one who wants safety in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn't want tractors or bulldozers to roll over his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to do without part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted, alluding to two attacks in the city in July that killed several people and injured dozens of people.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Ber and sacred and historical places" that lie on the territory of the Old Town.
"The one who wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
That won't work," he reiterated.
Withdrawal from the Golan heights
Olmert advocated a withdrawal of Israel from the Golan Heights, which he believes is an indispensable condition for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"My proposal is not to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of a withdrawal from the Golan Heights," Olmert affirmed.
"The Syrians know all too well what they have to do without to get back the Golan heights.
They will have to renounce their current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with the (Shiite) Hezbollah movement; they will have to renounce the constant support they grant to the terrorism of the (Shiite) Hamas movement, the terrorist network Al-Khaida and the Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," the prime minister concretized.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool down
If it fails to solve the problem with the Czech scientists charged in India with the unlawful collection of bugs, there could be some cooling of Czech-Indian relations, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
This was emphasized by the Minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this does not clear up, then sure, then there will be a certain cooling," he explained after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive branch could only intervene in judicial matters with difficulty.
Despite all this, he stated that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was acquitted of the indictment and received a fine, the central government wanted with the local government in Dardjiling, in whose jurisdiction the matter falls.
"His problem could be resolved," the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would be Mukherdshi's view that he would appeal to a higher authority.
He could thus request release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, according to the minister.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had also commented on negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to give the convict "competent legal support," the Indian minister cited.
At the same time, he said such help would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India that have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, he reaffirmed the Czech Republic in front of its partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a big mistake to detain and accuse these Czech scientists," he explained.
A response to the question of whether he had received from the Indian side the commitment to deal with the matter, the minister dodged.
"I've already been promised quite a lot," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know them, in a long-distance coach the walking is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a student agency bus near the Italian Padua, the question arises whether stewards and travellers are allowed to walk back and forth while driving on the bus.
"If we wanted to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of a steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident, which killed a twenty-two-year-old stewardess last week, was likely caused by the driver of the truck, who crossed the bus's path.
The young woman was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place in the car at that moment, although she had two more seats available.
However, a bus can also have an accident at the moment or brake sharply, in which the steward carries out coffee or newspapers.
A role also plays whether the bus is also equipped with standing places according to the vehicle letter.
If this is not provided on the bus, the travelers must sit.
Student Agency's long-distance coaches have no standing places; what the company's director, Radim Jančura, confirmed to Aktuálně.cz.
"We discussed this with the ministry, and this did not initially agree to the movement of travellers.
Later, this was withdrawn, and we reached a consensus that travellers would be allowed to go to the toilet while driving when they have their seat," he shared his point of view.
The law does not know a steward
"There is no clear legal interpretation for the role of a steward - no legislation describes this role.
However, there is also no legal provision that prohibits the carrier from providing services.
The law on road traffic only knows the term vehicle attendant; however, its rights and obligations it does not define," the spokesman for the Hanzelka ministry adds clearly.
The Director of the Road Vehicles Department of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, thinks that the law subsequently covers this issue.
"It depends on whether the bus also has standing rooms in the product approval.
That's all then," he insists.
Buses are divided into city buses, where there are standing rooms and the maximum speed is limited, local buses with standing rooms and a higher permitted speed and long-distance coaches without standing places with the highest permissible speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
The BESIP specialist for road safety Jaroslav Hořín does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of stewards on board a bus.
"With a smooth driving style, there are not many dangers, the situation is comparable to the service on board an aircraft.
Again, it's not certain when turbulence will come, and the stewardess can bump its head."
"However, if a bus brakes sharply, then of course the laws of physics also apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The carrier must clarify the security of the stewards through internal regulations," he says, and also thinks that this problem will not be solved completely from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to cancel the services
Student Agency is the only bus company to provide services from stewards.
The company employs about two hundred people in this role.
The director does not see her profession as risky even after the accident.
"But once I get the impression that the profession of steward is high-risk, I will delete it.
Coffee and newspapers can be given to travelers when boarding.
That would also cut costs," he said.
As an interest in security, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin justifies the lack of stewards in his bus. His company operates only a fraction of lines compared to Student Agency.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been fighting back from the beginning.
Sooner or later, this ends with some fatal accident," he had not quite a year ago for Týden.cz.
That was an incredible tragedy
In the accident of a scheduled bus to Naples, a young stewardess from the Pilsen region had crashed, who had worked for the company for two years.
The Slovenian truck had probably turned off the stand-off without blinking and had blocked the ride for the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to dodge through a sharp maneuver, but collided with the right front with the truck.
Jančura denies that the two places for the stewards had been sold.
"These places cannot be reserved on long-distance connections, they are blocked."
Company wants to sue truck drivers.
With compensation for the young woman's family, the agency will not wait for the court ruling, but she also expects financial damages from the guilty party.
A change in the law?
Not in sight
A more precise regulation of the movement of stewards on board a bus could bring a legal regulation, on which a thirty-member team of experts from the Ministry of Transport is already working for over a year.
"However, this has not yet reached a concrete conclusion.
Buses are also not necessarily on the agenda, rather the points system, the maximum speed on the highway and the use of mobile phones on the ride," according to expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not regard the activities of the stewards as something that could significantly endanger the safety of the passengers," Hanzelka said, with the control of the safety of the buses being the competence of the police and the occupational health and safety authorities.
A Czech judges the wrestling around the bottom of the sea
He approaches an electronic map depicting Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small dot, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself," said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is one of the thirty-member team of employees of the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Rights.
His boss, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it on and to.
There is a work elan and enthusiasm here.
The bottom of the sea has so far had a little-known world rich in natural sources.
Here is oil, other ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed, bigger than the mainland
The bordering states today vehemently registered their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN convention, they make use of their rights, on which they agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to a few hundred kilometers from the shore of a country into the sea.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive right to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simplified, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered, which is a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the shore sea, often the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone," explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the fixing of the external borders of the continental shelf must be submitted through extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications, namely from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the latter three countries have had success," Mikulka adds.
An international echo was recently met by the success of Australia, which was the first country to significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the expansion of the seabed, which was granted to the country by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times more than the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The gain that will flow to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise themselves, have invaluable value.
Other countries will also submit their applications gradually.
They can do this for ten years from the moment they ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement."
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is described by the convention as the "common heritage of humanity."
There is no longer a state to hold a special position here.
The right to promote in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a gold-digging country," says Director Mikulka, adding that "individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Some of the seabed now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This received the status of a so-called "groundbreaking investor" in 1991 due to the convention, as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton zone in the Silent Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is located there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"You can promote there on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," according to another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the Rober Sandev division brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with a little imagination, the legendary Schem who, according to legend, brought the golem to life.
Düsseldorf hopes rest on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of great words in the letter from the WestLB board to the employees of the house.
By combining units of the Düsseldorf financial institution with the Frankfurt Deka-Bank, "the central capital market house of the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe" could be created, according to the letter announced on Monday.
WestLB would bring a "competence block" with sustainable earning power into such a business.
And in general, such a connection could be the decisive impetus for further bundling in the Landesbanken sector.
This is how it reads when a board wants to demonstrate capacity for action in a difficult time.
Because the ailing WestLB is still under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also by the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, which has only recently made clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian state government, the time is urging to find a future solution.
However, there has been talk of a connection of a kind between the Deka bank, which savings bank customers know about because of their investment funds, and WestLB has been talking for some time - also on the Frankfurt side.
Although Deka-Bank CEO Franz Waas let it be known when presenting the half-year figures at the end of August, he sees no point in a merger of the house on the Mainzer Landstraße with a Landesbank, such as Helaba or WestLB.
But the Board of Directors of Deka, which is half supported by the Landesbanken and the Sparkassenverbanden, has commissioned the Executive Board to hold discussions with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be about the capital markets business or parts of it.
Of course, the talks have only just begun, according to the financial centre.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the more important employers in the financial centre Frankfurt, is not for the first time when it comes to consolidation in the savings bank sector.
In 2003, it looked for a moment that Deka-Bank could merge with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, this three-way covenant became nothing.
As soon as the plans had become public, the Hessian state government spoke out against the participation of Helaba.
The other two houses also did not find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz went instead to the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
But there have always been mind games about a connection of Deka-Bank with Landesbanken.
Most recently, however, Günther Merl, CEO of Helaba, had spoken out against simulation games about going together with his house.
Regardless, however, the realization seems to mature that a move together of the various houses of the public sector does hardship.
After the state election in Bavaria is over, the first thing that could be a connection between BayernLB and the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could move closer.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
Should the pressure on further mergers increase, it gradually assumes the partners.
In the south, it would only be a junior partner, although it has so far endured the financial crisis far better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
A merger with the West LB, in turn, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, which holds an 85 percent stake in Helaba, pushed a bar earlier this year.
At best, the Nord LB would remain.
However, such geostrategic considerations are only one side.
On the other, it is a question of how the different business models of the individual houses fit together.
In June, Merl expressed that the decisive question of which business model should ensure the future viability of the Landesbanken has not yet been answered by the German Savings Banks and Giro Association.
In the end, there could also be a decomposition of the West LB, which, of course, is not desired there.
So there is also talk in the letter of the local board that a "total solution" for the house is sought in any case.
How this can be reconciled with the merger of individual units with the Deka bank will still be shown.
The second weekend of Wiesn is known as the "Italian weekend"
For Elena it is the first, for Luca for the third or fourth time.
But this time Elena is there as his girlfriend, and so everything is different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter beer barrel of the Kaiser brand, stands a massively built bearder and proves to the approximately 200 Oktoberfest travelers what deep tones his throat can produce.
Elena gives Luca a pat first, then a kiss.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, the bus parking lot next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses, "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", are expected to start at 23.45 this evening, arriving at 6.30 a.m.
Three buses are reserved mainly for the Italians, in a bus only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, the South Americans are already singing next to their flag, they have already celebrated in the night.
And so loud, says Marco Guarda, this is not for Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with pelcimate lining and glasses with wide silver temples, own the buses.
They have been going to Oktoberfest for five years, and three tours this year alone.
At night, during the day on the Wiesn, back at 22.30.
Overnight would only mean unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, the welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed true to the Bavarian purity law, the health insurance and the German-speaking tour guide - Marco has attended a language course in Frankfurt - included.
And already the buses roll into the night, on the Autostrada direction "Brennero".
There's no beer, not yet.
It quickly becomes quiet on the bus, the travelers sleep.
All right, they're still going to need their powers.
It is held in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where several other buses with Italian license plates take a break on the Autobahn 8 just before Munich.
When Marcos Gruppe finally arrives in the parking lot near the Theresienwiese at half past seven o'clock in the morning, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco is giving one final address, explains the attack plan.
First, put on the yellow cap.
On it is on the left "Oktoberfest", in fracture, next to the Internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Secondly: "When the doors to the beer tent open, it's called running!" Marco shouts into the morning.
"Run!" Running and occupying the pitches in the back of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all yellow hats on the same benches, in the room!"
The measure, roars Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
And don't forget tipping.
"Show the security guards that we are behaving well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they're gone!"
Third: "Tonight point half past eleven again here!" Understood?
And now it's on to the Wiesn.
On the way, a yellow cap binds as waymarks to the trees, to signs and even to the election poster of a large Bavarian People's Party.
They want to be prepared for withdrawal.
It is the second Wiesn weekend, known as the "Italian weekend".
There is no precise information on figures; there is talk of 50 000 who make their way across the Alps and invade the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors are said to have travelled from Italy this weekend.
The Munich police are reinforced by seven policemen from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which carries a nation statistics, in which the Italians take first place before Britons (about 60 missions) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical cares.
The Hofbräu tent is particularly popular with Italians.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stable, German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück emphasized only last week.
How good that the politician used the word "relative" and also invaded that the German banking sector would not be spared from the crisis-ridden developments.
Because it has now occurred on the weekend.
The Munich-based real estate financier Hypo Real Estate (HRE), listed in the Dax, receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to shield itself from the turmoil in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the loan assistance amounted to up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the part it also claims.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
The background is losses at the subsidiary Depfa.
The state financier had refinanced itself extremely short-term, according to a newspaper report for long-term projects for which he has lent money - which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 million euros, and the equity ratio had also declined slightly from 1.6 to 1.45 percent.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to zero compared with the same period last year, income from attributions to receivables and certain securities, and from the dissolution of provisions in the credit business by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher income from refunds of downstream clearing costs from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group as well as from the reimbursement of interest according to the Fiscal Code and from the business provision for Group companies, the earnings reduction had still been moderate at around 16 percent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former state financier had initially speculated with commercial real estate loans, which had then been spun off in the Aareal Bank.
Because one earned too little in the classic state financing, the Depfa had then become increasingly involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of community projects of private investors and the state (private public partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
Hypo Real Estate now has to make depreciation and amortization on the value of the subsidiary, which will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss account, it says quite indefinitely.
The fact is that the dividend has been cancelled.
It had already been cut by two-thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major state and infrastructure financier since the Depfa takeover.
It is more dependent than other institutions on refinancing in the interbank market, as it has no customer deposits.
With the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, lending among banks has again largely dried up, as the banks hoard their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing annually for a part - around 50 billion euros - of Depfa's loan portfolio.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the Group's financing needs are covered by the loan for the foreseeable future and the company is shielded "from the influence of the currently largely incapable international money markets."
From other sources, it can be heard that thanks to the funds, the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE CEO Georg Funke stated that Hypo Real Estate Group will no longer have to use the money markets for the foreseeable future.
Bundesbank and the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) assume that the marketability of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now secured.
That stands to hope for shareholders and creditors of the bank.
But given the dynamics and uncertainties of the crisis, there is arguably no certainty.
It is even not unthinkable that the funding does not have to be fully used.
But even the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank was still facing insolvency late on Sunday evening, the at least provisional rescue cannot calm the minds.
The share price collapses by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
Bond prices, on the other hand, are holding up quite well.
While the priority debt is barely moving, the prices of the subordinated bonds are yielding more significantly.
Above all, the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and understandably the terms beyond 2009 are affected.
If hypo-real-estate bonds appear to be a speculative investment alternative, their value must be regarded as dependent on the stability of the international financial system after the significant worsening of the banking crisis and the institution itself, which had only brought the crisis into the house with the takeover of the Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and less ailing commercial banks are still ready to support the system, a timely repayment of pensions can be assumed.
Or it occurs that, which currently hardly anyone dares to hope for - that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
But in view of the reports that are overturning with the partial nationalisation, the probability of security has only become a legitimate hope at present.
This should be something that should give long-term believers some sleepless nights with the decision whether to separate themselves from their commitments.
Short-term investors can at least use a final line to form a loss carry-forward for the future withholding tax payments on price gains of later years.
German special forces were on the scene during hostage liberation
The Egyptian government had requested help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it got serious, the special forces were ready, but they did not come to use.
More and more details are becoming known about the circumstances of the liberation of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both specialists from the Bundeswehr and officers of GSG 9 were the aviator squadron of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Police Office and logistics experts from the Technical Relief Agency at the site of the liberation.
However, as spokespersons for the ministries announced on Monday evening, the German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as support staff on the ground.
"Thankfully, this has not happened," a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior said.
Attackers had the tour group from the five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and her eight Egyptian companions on the 19th. Kidnapped in southern Egypt in September.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been taken back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear until recently as well as the details of the exemption or possible ransom payments.
The rescued have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on details of the release.
In Berlin, there was initially no information on when they would return to Germany.
According to "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Luftwaffe and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento Box
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16, is to introduce herself on the first day of school at Tachibana High School, the girls start to giggle: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from manga - in the new exchange log she tells of Japan.
"The first day of school in Japan.
I was excited.
Even before I was in school, I had a bammel.
I live on the edge of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and take a train to Tachibana High School for 40 minutes.
I had to find the way alone, fortunately I didn't get lost.
The start of classes does not seem to be as strictly defined at the Tachibana as in our home in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive from eight o'clock, until at twenty before nine a short meeting session begins with the teacher, the 'home room'.
But before the lessons started, it was my turn to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to speak in front of people, even in front of a class of 40 students.
Because I have not yet had a school uniform, I put on an old skirt of my host mother, plus blouse, blue knee socks and black leather shoes.
So in this elevator I put myself in front of the desk and tried to say everything right: 'Sayonara Wo she Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and have a birthday in a week.
At that moment I was very happy that I had already started learning the language a good two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class have all snuggled, giggled and waved and continued, I heard the word "Kawaii."
I already knew that from my manga.
It belongs to the vital vocabulary of Japanese girls and means 'cute, cute'.
Then I swept into my seat quickly.
The girl next to me grinned quite broadly, she thought it was an honor that the exchange student should sit next to her.
The rest of the hour was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally stormed.
Everyone talked and giggled and asked me holes in my stomach - but it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone unpacked their bentos.
My host mother had also made me such a lunchbox - this is something different from the dull German break breads.
I had rice with herbs, small sausages, salad of cucumbers and algae, fruit and a kind of meat in the tofu coat.
I usually don’t have a shamble on what I eat here in Japan.
Things look strange and taste completely new.
It is clear that everything is really delicious.
Well, except for the salty plums, maybe, brrrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch at Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a boy a self-prepared bento, which she then prepares particularly artfully - in the hope of getting to know the boy better during the snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I'm curious to see if I can watch this.
'Why Japan of all people?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said,
"Because it fascinates me."
I’ve loved reading manga for years.
And in order for me to better understand the comics and the culture in it, I also started to learn a bit of Japanese at some point.
So for me it was perfectly clear that I had to travel here at some point.
Because I also have a penchant for tradition, customs and customs.
And you attach great importance to them here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends - on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I haven’t felt lost here, even if Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
U.S. House of Representatives rejects bailout
The first chamber of the US Congress has narrowly failed the 700 billion dollar bailout for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones rushed into the deep.
By a vote of 206 to 227, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government's bailout for the financial markets.
Despite all the appeals from US President George W. Bush and leaders of both parties did not have a majority in favour of the programme to contain the chaos in financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the proponents had desperately tried to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to give approval, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn't happened yet," he acknowledged.
Even in the course of the vote, the Dow Jones collapsed more than six percent, or by 600 points.
The reason was investor worries that the government bailout could fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, then, after the failure became known, to crash again.
Experts now expect further severe turmoil in international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the program, the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is necessary.
Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees in case of danger means that it also feels fear?
The neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux is convinced: Even a lot of animals have feelings.
But how could you check if they feel the same if they behave similarly to us?
In the Internet magazine "Edge" contributions of famous scientists have been published for several years.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents selected answers to the question "What do you think is true without being able to prove it?" in a series?
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove this where we can’t even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, we can at least hope, since all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we turn to other species and tailor questions of sensation or, more generally, to consciousness, we enter rough terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: it turns up dead, flees or attacks.
People behave similarly, from which some scientists conclude a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe in that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to that of animals.
On the one hand, the circuits almost always associated with human consciousness include the lateral prefrontal cortex (because of its involvement in short-term memory and execution/control functions).
This broad region is much more developed in humans than in the other primates and seems to be completely missing from other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including the knowledge of who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is even different from the other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity is likely to lie in the linguistic nature of man: since such a large part of his experience is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals could be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, as it may be, is probably very different from most of our consciousness states.
Therefore, it is difficult to determine what awareness may look like in other animals.
If, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, his exploration presents us with great problems.
Most of my remarks relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
One could examine the consciousness processes of animals without regard to their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, especially the example of visualization.
But with this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick went after, one refers to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: Both may be identical or not.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the prefrontal cortex for the formation of the visualization.
What is now for the sensations?
I attribute them to the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated consciously in one of its own activity.
So what we call “fear” is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as physical responses) proves memory.
From this point of view, sensations are closely tied to the regions of the cortex, which distinguish primates and in particular humans.
Combined with the linguistic nature, fine gradations of feeling result, because we can differentiate and categorize states with the help of words and grammar in order to ascribe them to others besides ourselves.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, thinks that sensations from more primitive activities in the body-feeling regions of the cortex and the brain stem similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it may well be involved in cross-genre sentiments.
In theory, I cannot contradict this, but I think it is unprovable.
Pankseep argues what seems to be fear in rats and people, probably also feels so in both cases: But how can you check whether rats and people feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
A cockroach flees in danger if it also feels fear?
In my eyes, mere behavioral similarity cannot yet prove equality of experience.
Although the neural comparison helps further: Rats and people have similar brain strains, but cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
And even if you could prove this for humans: How did you want to prove it in rats?
I believe that rats and other mammals, perhaps even cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how to prove it.
And because their sensations are probably fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on special circuits and on language), I prefer to explore emotional behavior rather than the emotional sensations of rats.
In any case, progress is beckoning here at the neural level, provided you measure the same thing in rats and people.
As I do not explore language and consciousness in rats, not so not sensations, I do not know if they exist.
You may think that's short-sighted, but I'd rather move forward than constantly running against a wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Uefa President Platini: Grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and prime minister.
"The government sees Uefa's decision in Bordeaux as a vote of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to host the EM along with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has only just begun and there is still a lot of work to be done in both countries.”
In the schedule for the construction or conversion of the stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, the two hosts are lagging behind.
It is possible that even the number of European Championship stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We now have to work at top speed," Ukrainian Federation President Grigorij Surkis said.
"UEFA will keep a constant eye on us."
An even more radical move was decided in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish association PZPN has been suspended by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The commission had met at the request of Sports Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
"There is a serious risk that the PZPN is not capable of acting according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Poland's PAP news agency.
"We have assured Uefa president Michel Platini in a letter that the preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer."
Several first division clubs had been sentenced to forced relegation last season alone for manipulation, after all, even the league start had to be postponed at short notice.
Organizers record rising booking numbers
It seems like a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have risen significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, the desire to travel of the Germans remains untroused, according to a study.
In the case of bookings for the winter season, the travel offices recorded a revenue increase of 31 percent compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German Travel Association (DRV) announced on Monday in Berlin.
According to the study of the market research institute GfK, there are also increased booking figures for the autumn months.
For example, the increase in sales of the travel agencies for October was around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on figures from GfK, which evaluates monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and extrapolates it for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 were recorded.
Because of the weak dollar rate, travel to the USA is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the increase in bookings is around a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece as well as the domestic climes are particularly sought-after destinations among the Germans.
Package holidays in particular are in high demand, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of rising costs for energy and food, the costs are "better calculated for the customer than with the individually organized holiday".
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early bird discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will be an increase in sales compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip fell compared to the previous year.
Outraged Dennis Quaid strikes back
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke about privates in the interview - and is now in trouble with the ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan outed her lapsed Dennis Quaid as a marriage breaker.
He's foaming - and hitting back.
Late war of the roses with the ex-couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors are now having an unsightly dispute with each other - in public.
Meg Ryan had first commented on the reasons for the marriage's failure in an interview with the US magazine InStyle last week: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and that was very painful."
She only learned the extent of the fraud after the divorce.
The reason for the soul striptease was Ryan's press work for her new film "The Women" - the story of an adultery is told.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his outing as an unfaithful husband was clear: "Outrageous" was it, the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News that "Meg is once again chewing and resealing the history of our relationship."
It is also “regrettable” that the 16-year-old son Jack is once again “publicly reminded of the pain and upheaval that a divorce means for every child.”
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
And so conclude his admissions with the side blow: "My life goes on anyway.
I'm lucky to have a wonderful family that's fine."
Prices for airline tickets and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than the previous year.
In Germany, flights even became up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and overnight stays in hotels have become cheaper again - that's the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its booking data from the first half of 2008 and found a significant slump in the second quarter after rising prices in the first quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already cheapened.
From January to March, prices in 41 out of 48 European cities surveyed still rose by an average of 6.9 percent compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most evident in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than a year earlier.
As a cause of this, American Express sees the weak dollar exchange rate, which has led to a "decreasing desire to travel by American tourists."
Financial centres such as Frankfurt and London are also more affected by the decline in hotel prices than industrial locations such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices even hold the record in Europe with an increase of 26.3 percent.
The trend in the first quarter also showed the upward trend in terms of airfares:
Due to the increase in kerosene, travelers in the economy class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even became up to 29.2 percent more expensive.
From April to June, prices for economy-class airline tickets fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but in business and first-class price changes were far lower.
In Germany, prices collapsed even more than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices were up 11.9 percent, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
On German domestic flights, prices have even halved, according to the study.
The reason for the price slump is, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, explains the company.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market is crumbling.
On the other hand, the open-skies agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the US and Europe, is an increase in competitive pressure.
The sign of the tense situation was the cancellation of unprofitable routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that filed for bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone, this was 24 airlines.
HSV beat Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburger SV becomes the leader of the standings.
At Borussia, Luhukay continues to fail to find a functioning elf.
Von Kristoffer Klein enlarge crash landing for national player Marko Marin.
The Gladbacher came into the game late and failed with a lifter to the bar.
His message was precisely worded, she went convincingly over his lips.
He simply knew he was right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger hissed in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
There was not much going on in the catacombs, the half-time break was over and most were back in their seats.
Rieger was a physiotherapist of the HSV for almost three decades, he enjoys a higher reputation than some past actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg's head coach Martin Jol.
His command will have been similar: Get there with gate two!
The implementation was not possible.
"It wasn't all nice to watch today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Bastian Reinhardt would also have "wished it more relaxed."
The 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the header of Mladen Petric (11th); and the fact that very weak Gladbach could not hurt the weak hamburgers.
"It was a dirty win," Martin Jol summed up.
Hamburger SV will be 121 years old this Monday.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and the lightning table on the video wall, which identified their club as a class prime.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
"We know how to classify that," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the tabular interim certificate stands more for the unpredictability of the league than for the dominance of his HSV.
The team with their late commitments - the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the goal scorer Petric and the FC Bayern poached Jansen - find themselves slow, but she is not yet able to shine.
"We need more flair and more dribbles," Jol urged.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski-Hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jugs and celebs in designer dirndls.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I'm a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: Barely three minutes on the Wiesn, the photographers rush at us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap dirndl seems to serve its purpose.
When Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the Weißwurstequator, the feeling of well-being in the costume was still limited.
But first arrived at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or Lederhosn; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - all completely normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only reap my dirndl apron.
A Munich woman draws my attention to the fact that I would have tied the apron wrongly: "Links hoast free, middle virgin, forgiven on the right, widowed in the back."
Secretly I frown the loop from back to left.
"Fit," it said, and laughs.
Others put less effort into subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretch against an uninvited the bare rear.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous," with a long-drawn "ooooo."
That's what he tells me after he gets rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, which everyone thinks is a trash can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of the alcohol this way.
Around eight o'clock in the evening, paramedics walk in droves over the fairground, who have to take care of the poor sips.
The nurses always perform in the pack - always four at once drag a covered stretcher from tent to tent.
This works like most Wiesn visitors: Empty, fully back again.
Who is in the Promille coffin under the tarpaulin, you do not see.
"That's what they pack where they goarn," one of the paramedics shouted to me on request, disappearing in the hustle and bustle.
After the vote defeat
On Wall Street, fear is over.
Initial news of the bailout failed caused the Dow Jones to break down 700 points at times.
That was the biggest point loss within a day in its history.
Later, the Dow caught something again.
At about 20:30, the world's most important stock market barometer was down a good five percent at 10,579 points.
Technology exchange Nasdaq was down 1548 points at more than seven percent.
The biggest loser at the time was in the Dow American Express, which lost just under 14 percent and Bank of America with a loss of around twelve percent.
No title could win.
Shares of bank Goldman Sachs dropped nearly ten percent.
Just a few days ago, major investor Warren Buffett had invested in the company.
Under the rescue plan, the funds are to be provided for the purchase of so-called rotten mortgage securities.
However, the sum should not be paid out in one fell swoop, but gradually.
In return, the state should receive stock payment slips from the financial companies, which could be redeemed with a corresponding price development in order to reduce the burden on the state treasury.
Share prices in Europe and USA in the downward spiral
The billions in aid for banks in Europe and the US do not address investor doubts.
The share price of the German bank Hypo Real Estate crashes and tears the Dax down.
The U.S. index Dow Jones is losing despite the planned bailout of the financial market by the state.
Spectacular price losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have slashed the German stock index (Dax) deep.
The share of the Munich real estate financier lost three-quarters of its value at times despite the bailout of the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank gave up more than 20 percent.
The Dax slipped well below the psychologically important 6000-point mark, notching up 3.7 percent at 5,839 points.
Globally, stock markets have slammed into the knees.
In New York, Wall Street opened with significant losses.
Investors feared that the US government's 700 billion dollar bailout could not be sufficient to get financial markets going again.
The Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trading, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the vote in the Senate could be on 1. October follow.
The other European stock exchanges also knew only one direction: In London, the FTSE index initially declined by 3.2 percent, while the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading index Nikkei fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slid 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading index of Sensex lost 506.43 points, or 3.9 percent, closing at 12,595.75 points.
In the MDax, shares of Arcandor gave way after the announcement of a capital increase.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has subscribed for the 23 million new shares.
The trade and tourism group also announced that the shares will not be sold to Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon in research has caused perplexity: dark matter affects the speed of spacecraft during so-called swing-by maneuvers.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew through space.
Because of soon-to-freeze fuel lines, she is now threatened with cold death.
Among scientists, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion for years - the swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is a flight maneuver of spacecraft, in which they receive additional momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical trick as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What the researchers have been surprising for years, however, is that the missiles do not behave 100 percent in the way one would expect according to the time-honoured gravitational law.
Rather, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes are unexpectedly getting faster or slower.
So far, the physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
They christened him swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter through a curvature of space, might not be quite right.
The American physicist Stephen Adler from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton still firmly believes that Einstein was not mistaken, and tries to explain the swing-by anomaly with the help of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have identified in the universe.
"Responsible to the anomaly could be dark matter, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about ten years.
It obviously assumes an attraction, the effect of which can be observed on other heavenly bodies.
It itself, on the other hand, is completely invisible, that is, it does not transmit and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, in particular no visible light.
According to the scientists’ calculations, dark matter accounts for a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After ten days in the hands of their kidnappers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt are to be free again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom money.
In a shooting before release, six hostage-takers are said to have been killed.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Ransom negotiations are already underway.
Again and again, Germans are targeted by kidnappers.
WORLD ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are apparently free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab TV channel Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release, according to reports by Italian television channel Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed.
We're checking their health status right now," Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and a Romanian, as well as her eight Egyptian companions, were well up and in safety, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 participants in a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background to a shooting before the release of the hostages remains unclear: According to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with a ransom," the official said.
It was "just a matter of receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers had shot dead six of the kidnappers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
The hostage-takers had demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife one of the hostages.
The daily newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported, citing a German mediator, that the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers want to release the female hostages after paying the ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Name of accident victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex was announced.
Carole Paulson, a resident of Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in Friday afternoon's accident on Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's hospital in Romford but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Abuse of stepfather 'led to suicide'
The years of abuse by her stepfather has caused a woman to kill herself, a court has reported.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, was given a six-year prison sentence after confessing to eight counts of sexual abuse.
The Criminal Court in Truro learned that he regularly handcuffed his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession: "I feel responsible for her death."
The court learned that Ms Randle was at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on 1. April 2007, killed at the age of 34.
When she was living in Coventry as a child, Trerise had tied her up and blindfolded her eyes before performing sexual acts while her mother was gone to work in a restaurant.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and he moved back to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms Randle, who volunteered for the National Trust for much of her time, was prosecuted by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsay Quaife reported to the court that friends had said that Ms Randle, who had been a eager surfer and cyclist, had been "emotionally dead" since 2006 and had "relied on her life"
In April 2007, her real father Terrance Randle found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself by means of a plastic bag.
Mr Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession letter that ended like this: "I used to tie her up and blindfold her."
"I didn't sexually coerce her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are an extremely strange fetishist and for her sacrifice it must have been terrifying, especially since she was only seven.
This unpleasant story ends with the suicide of the victim.
Worse still is the fact that it is very unlikely that the matter would have ended in court if it had not done so.'
He added: "I take note of the impact, according to the description of Stephanie's father and mother, had their act over the years on their daughter.
She would have been a promising, successful and happy young woman otherwise.”
Officials responsible for lost data are charged
The BBC has learned that the cabinet official, who lost strictly confidential documents on a train in June, will be charged under the "Public Security Act."
The man was seconded by the Ministry of Defence when he lost two highly confidential documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to police.
It is the weakest charge within the law and there is no indication of criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the action was a surprise to many in Whitehall.
He said: "They would have thought that this would be dealt with internally at the Ministry of Defence and Cabinet."
The employee whose name cannot be mentioned is charged in accordance with paragraph 8.1 of the Act, the clause dealing with the secure retention of information.
The royal prosecutor's office recommended that the officer be indicted by the Metropolitan police for the highly sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he moved included classified assessments about Al-Qaeda and the capacities of Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken from his home to a secret location.
Housing associations face B&B costs
British housing associations could face costs of more than 80 million pounds after the rescue of the Bradford and Bingley Bank.
The government provided 14 billion pounds to protect Bradford & Bingley's deposits of 2.6 million customers.
The interest on this loan is paid by all companies that receive money from investors, including the 59 building societies
The general director of the Association of Housing Associations (BSA), Adrian Coles, said it was "unbearable" that the societies and their members would have to pay.
The 14 billion loan will ultimately be repaid when Bradford & Bingley's loans are repaid.
But the interest accumulated in the meantime is credited every year to those 700 financial firms that accept deposits.
The financial services compensation programme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 housing associations were included in this figure.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to cover some of the costs of those institutions that were far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It said that each company would have to pay in proportion to the deposits it would hold, and that the companies together would have to pay about 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest rates on the loan will amount to 450 million pounds in 2009.
This means that the companies have to procure 81 million pounds for the interest of the first year.
Adrian Coles, the general manager of the Association of Housing Associations, told the BBC that he believed this was unfair.
It is bitter that those institutions that have behaved prudently during the real estate upswing are now being called upon to bear some of the costs from those institutions that have been far less prudent.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the records were established in 1945.
"We will be watching all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what alternatives there are to protect housing associations and their members of potentially significant costs."
Interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010, interest is due for a full year and that could be almost twice as much.
Because building societies are bilateral organizations without shareholders, their members will have to pay for the costs either through higher fees or lower interest on savings accounts.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were interested in entering Turkey's hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, perhaps just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
That, at least, is what the guides tell you.
The building sits rittling at the end of the platforms with a tower at every corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German City Hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is disintegrating
But once you are within the arched ticket office, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, the westernmost access of which was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a late-stagger in the imperialist game, had to implement before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and further out what Saudi Arabia is today.
But Germany's imperialist projects slackened during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, generated by the insurmountable borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the ornate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely transitioned from history.
Nowadays, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of Turkey's diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a completely new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian splinter groups Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I climbed the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the AKP's leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the equal step of the old world in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail," I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity
This has sparked some distrust in the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi has taken me to the main office of the AKP, a specially made, ultra-modern stone and steel structure, in an evolving suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping centers and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first deals of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a BlackBerry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception," he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Nowadays, she has to look to the east and the west at the same time.
There would be no one or the other.
She should do both.
"But certainly at some point Turkey could," I asked, "be forced to make up your mind?"
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to face this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely recited: Turkey’s relations, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be, Europe as a whole can travel figuratively on that same railway track east towards Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpasha's station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lords, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey's hands.
And when I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe."
At the time, at least, there didn't seem to be much doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
Milk becomes five pence per litre more expensive
People in Jersey are faced with having to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced it will raise the wholesale price of its milk by another five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two pence increase in February, and comes after investigations by a consulting firm were conducted.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether to pass on the price increase to their customers.
Before the price hike in February, Jersey Milch's wholesale price last changed in 2002.
Former Bangladeshi prime minister to be denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested if she returns to the country.
Her defense lawyers said the court denied bailing to have extorted 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman while she was prime minister.
The case is one of several floating charges of corruption against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami alliance, demanded that the military-backed transitional government should first grant her full freedom.
The correspondents say that although her suspension of detention has been granted to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear as part of her release whether she will be able to remain at large if she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court's decision.
"The upper court has rejected Sheikh Hasina's bail request because it says she does not have to be granted bail, as she is already on suspension of detention abroad to be treated abroad," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
We will file a legal complaint against the high court."
Their lawyers object to needing bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to leave after the 17th. October will return home, an Awami alliance party chairman said Sunday.
She was jailed last year after the army-backed transitional government took power but had been released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Fears over anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan
In the recent anti-polio initiative in Afghanistan, nearly 200 000 children have not been vaccinated because of the violence linked to the Taliban, according to the United Nations.
The United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
However, they could not reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
According to a spokesman for the UN, this was the case despite the Taliban’s promise not to attack or hinder the thousands of employees carrying out the vaccinations.
BskyB loses lawsuit in ITV case
BskyB has lost its action against the competition commission's decision to reduce its stake in competing broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Appeals Court has prescribed BskyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17.9% to below 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission had claimed that BskyB's share distorted the competition and allowed it an unfair influence on the broadcaster ITV.
BskyB acquired its stake in 2006 by successfully preventing NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority reported that the purchase of the stake in ITV by BskyB was causing doubts about the independence of the ITV, which has prompted the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin Boss Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and the Ofcom Communications Office have opposed the purchase.
BskyB argued that the pressure to reduce his share of ITV was an unreasonable and exaggerated measure, especially because BskyB had announced that he wanted to give up his voting rights.
New investigation into the US prosecutor's affair
The U.S. attorney general has hired a special prosecutor to deal with the termination of the nine prosecutors in the U.S. in 2006.
The occasion was a report by the Department of Justice's Inspector General, in which the actions of the administration staff were criticized.
The report drew criticism from White House officials, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was driven by fears that the lawyers had been deposed for political reasons.
Special investigator Nora Dannehy is now said to be clarifying whether the officers interrogated during the investigation were lying to investigators to obstruct the judiciary.
Serious allegations, including criminal action, have not been fully investigated or clarified, Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The appeal of a special investigator with the authority to force the witnesses to testify was one of his main recommendations.
The conflict began when the Justice Department removed nine U.S. prosecutors from their offices in December 2006.
At that point, the ministry argued prosecutors would be laid off due to weak work benefits.
However, it was later found that the dismissed prosecutors had been judged no worse than many of their colleagues, prompting many observers to view the terminations as politically motivated.
Some of these prosecutors were involved in the judicial prosecution of senior Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the accusations of voter fraud by the Democrats.
U.S. prosecutors are tasked with investigating and prosecuting judicial cases for the government.
They can be dismissed at any time, but may not be deposed for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department Attorney General Alberto Gonzales has come under fire because of the layoffs and has in the end resigned his office.
A number of Justice Department officials have also quit.
The inspector general's report, in particular, has critically addressed the role of Gonzales by carrying the "main responsibility" for the layoffs, "giving up" his leadership role and showing himself "exceptionally disinterested" in the process
Other officials, including former President Bush's chief adviser, Karl Rove, have been criticised for inadequate cooperation with investigators.
Meat Loaf's epic song to be honored
Rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored during the music award ceremony "Q Award" for his epic anthem "Bat Out Of Hell."
The singer, who will accept his special golden prize during the award ceremony in London next week, said he was honored to be recognised.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track to Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
"Coldplay" tops the nominations for this year's award ceremony, having been shortlisted in four categories.
The editor-in-chief of Q Magazine Paul Rees said there were some songs that go beyond such matters as time and genre and "Bat Out Of Hell" was certainly one of them.
The song, written by Jim Steinman, required a powerful voice delivered by Meat Loaf.
It starts with an instrumental part that lasts almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK as a single in 1979 on sale and has reached number 15 in the charts.
However, Meat Loaf's "Bat Out Of Hell" has spent about nine years in the charts, selling more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf, whose true name is Marvin Lee Aday, has suffered from serious health problems in recent years. One of them was an operation in 2003 for irregular heartbeat after he collapsed on stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel concerts due to acute throat inflammation.
It was later revealed that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Obscure street in city, often forgotten and possibly soon to sell
New York City has thousands of main roads, avenues, side streets and other bypasses, some of which are famous and others are just convenient.
Still, it's hard to tell even for experienced taxi drivers and longtime locals where Extra Place is located, simply because most have never heard of it.
This tiny street is in the East Village and runs north from First Street between Bowery and Second Avenue without reaching Second Street.
It is 30 feet wide and 120 feet long and looks more like a dusty alley than an actively used thoroughfare.
There are no street signs either.
It's virtually impossible to find them on a standard road map.
This street still has its admirers.
For example, Avalon Bay, a construction company that recently built luxurious buildings on First Street.
It wants to re-pave Extra Place to create a clean drive-through to the shops and boutiques expected in the new buildings.
Among the other suitors is the long-standing neighborhood, which says it is fascinated by the short alley simply because it is one of the remains of the building block's past.
But the city administration department, which is responsible for the protection and construction of the residential buildings and is responsible for the street, has no interest in preserving it.
During a meeting of the local council's land use committee this month, representatives from the city council and Avalon Bay have drafted a proposal for the construction company's purchase of the road.
Still, the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be submitted next month, according to Susan Stetzer, the district manager in local council 3.
"Very little space has remained in the possession of the city and we would like Extra Place to continue to belong to the city," she said.
"There could be offers on how to repair and operate the road, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want public access guaranteed."
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it would re-pave the small street and set up seats that are intended, among other things, for a café to which the company wants to rent space.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the road was made public for the first time during the session this month.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wanted to use the road, it did not necessarily want to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renovate this derelict alley and make it a public meeting place," she said, adding that the city itself had proposed the sale.
Seth Donlin, spokesman for the Department of Building Protection, said it was actually the city's desire to sell the road and stressed that the department's job was to develop rather than manage the properties.
Compared to its colorful neighborhood The Bowery, Extra Place has retained some of its historical impression.
Some believe that the road got its name in 1802, when a large farm belonging to Philip Minthorne was divided between its numerous children and a narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB music club, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place and the street is certainly most well known as the backdrop for the photo on the cover of the album "Rocket to Russia" by Ramones.
The patch was great, said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
The road was full of scrap, rags and parts of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes.
Some residents, including the bloggers who write about the gentrification of the East Village, have rejected the idea of selling Extra Place, with the argument that this public property, as modest as it is, is to remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a virtually unchanged shard of the city that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs the blog called "Jeremiah's Vanishing New York" (subtitled "The Book of Lawsuits: A Bitter Nostalgic View of the Extinct City"), has published part of the conversation of city history about Extra Place, which appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote at the time: "Extra Place is a small narrow dead end that even remains dark during the day and is marked by rusted metal door of the warehouses, locked windows and weekly newspapers flying past rain gutters ".
With a few exceptions, the street looked exactly like this in one evening.
A rat ran through the back of the street, not far from the door that used to lead to the CBGB, where a more expensive clothing store is now located.
Graffiti could be seen on the walls and an empty beer bottle lay on the floor not far from a fresh bundle of discarded newspapers.
Some passers-by said they had rarely thought about Extra Place, but suggested that the road could be polished up a bit.
Fields, added that in his opinion, some people underestimate the appeal of the street in their current state.
The best years of my life, he said, were in the places that were dark, damp and disgusting.
Debate on bilingual education: education in English-speaking environment
In this issue of the "Education Watch," Bruce Fuller and Lance T discuss. Izumi the positions of the candidates for bilingual training.
Lance T. Izumi, senior research associate in California Studies and senior director in the Department of Educational Sciences at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is a co-author of the book "Not as Good as One Thinks: Why the Middle Class Needs a School Selection."
Addressing the Hispanic voters is a complicated task.
Barrack Obama's proposals on education are a typical example of this.
Obama's election campaign mentions that "the likelihood of African-American and Hispanic students successfully completing the school is lower than in white students" - which is true.
To close this achievement gap, Obama’s education plan specifically recommends, among other things, a bilingual transitional period in education for those who first learn English.
Still, the question to Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which puts emphasis on teaching in languages other than English, contradicts his interest in reducing the distance in school performance.
Take, for example, "Sixth Street Prep," an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles.
The majority of students are Hispanic and come from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been in the country, learn English.
Nevertheless, in 2008, an astonishing 100 percent of fourth-grade students passed the state exam in maths at a good level.
Also surprising, 93 percent of the children from the fourth school year were rated as good in the English exam.
This amazing success has been achieved with different methods than those favored by Obama.
The Sixth Street school puts its emphasis on review and practice, on steady control of knowledge and an attitude that tolerates no exceptions.
Furthermore, the school practices the approach according to which the training takes place in an English-speaking environment. That's exactly the point Obama should be aware of, according to headmistress Linda Mikels.
This approach attaches great importance to the almost exclusive use of the English language in specialist teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who rejects the idea of bilingual education, told me the school had a remarkable success with a student who had only just come from Mexico. 12 months later, you would be able to enter the classroom and no longer recognize it.
"It works," she noted, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like the "Sixth Street Prep" as a model for other schools with a large share of Latin American and other English-learning students?
The school's achievements would make the answer to this question easy, but the educational policy positions within his own party (the national educational associations have long supported the idea of bilingual education) and his own consistent support of bilingual education make predictions about Obama's answer uncertain.
While agreeing with the point that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the issue by noting that people should stop worrying about the legislation aimed at "only English."
Instead, he said, "you're supposed to make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Obama actually wants to close the performance gap, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise and trivialize them.
The price of oil is falling as a result of renewed fears about the economy
The price of oil fell sharply on Monday due to fears that even the American bailout plan for the financial markets could not be enough to revive the economy again.
Crude oil futures on the New York trading exchange have fallen 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel in the morning session.
Since last Monday, the price has dropped by more than $20.
In the past two weeks, the goods markets have been rocked by both the financial turmoil on Wall Street and strong hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After prices peaked at $145.29 per barrel in July, they fell to almost $90 a barrel this month, then rose again, as a result of the enormous uncertainty in financial markets.
On Monday, investors expressed concern again, although congressional representatives had announced they had agreed over the weekend on a rescue plan that should be the largest in history.
This news was overshadowed by new worries that the financial crisis was still far from over.
In the last chapter of the growing crisis, according to a government announcement on Monday, Citigroup is to buy up the banking business of the Wachovia Corporation.
In the meantime, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial group Fortis.
According to analysts at Barclays Capital, despite the tense negotiations that took place over the weekend and led to a rescue plan, it has apparently failed to revive sentiment in the markets.
As the economic situation continues to deteriorate, demand for goods, including oil, is expected to continue to decline.
Analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a statement to investors that forecasts for global capital markets, interest rates and exchange rates have become extremely uncertain.
We believe, they continue, write that the goods markets will also be affected.
"From the perspective of the goods markets, we are most concerned about whether the US virus is spreading worldwide, particularly to China."
The bank's analysts have revised downward their expectations for oil consumption due to weak economic growth for the coming year, and lowered their forecasts for the oil and gas price for 2009 by 20%.
Team record set by series in second quarter
Centre-back Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all after running up in the Jets jersey more often than anyone in the last eight-and-a-half years.
Then he saw Sunday's second quarter, in which the Jets turned an inconclusive game into a triumphal procession.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
After a sloppy game between the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals, which matched the bad weather, the second quarter began.
However, when quarterback Brett Favre's pass arrived at Lavernues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, that marked the perfect kick-off to an afternoon when her evolving collaboration made a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles in this quarter for another two touchdowns, which once slipped as an outside-back and the other time 10 seconds before the end of half-time.
"I didn't put in a lot of effort," Coles says of the passes that went to Coles.
“He’s a super player.
Our vote was right, no matter what people think."
While Favre and Coles were playing catch, the defense took apart quarterback Kurt Warner.
Outside-back Darrelle Revis intercepted an accidental throw and turned him into a 32-yard touchdown.
Libero Erik Smith got to another pass and intercepted him.
Linebacker David Bowens then caused a loss from Warner.
The last ball loss, forced at Bowens, was probably the craziest.
The Cardinals had captured the ball with 10 seconds left in the game when the Jets recaptured the ball and Jay Feely converted a 20 yard shot to the 34 to 0 lead.
Those were the most points the Jets had ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Erik Mangini, the coach of the Jets "The Second Quarter or the Third Quarter?" replied
To the answers both, because the Jets allowed 21 points in the third quarter without scoring a single one, Mangini said: "Believe me, I enjoyed the second quarter more than the third.
A lot of points were scored in a short time.”
Rested Gebrselassie beats his world record
Haile Gebrselassie from Ethiopia has shown again why some consider him the best long-distance runner of all time, having broken his own record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and has become the first person to make the distance of 42.2 kilometers in less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With the victory on the flat course in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has improved his previous result of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which he had achieved last year in Berlin.
Gebrselassie, 35, has his 26th World record in his versatile career, in which he has reached at least one world championship title or set a world record on every distance from one kilometer to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Olympic marathon in Beijing for fear that was perhaps exaggerated in retrospect that air pollution could exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he signed up for the competition in Berlin.
In almost ideal conditions - in sun and 9 degrees at the start and 13 degrees at the finish - Gebrselassie has won with an average speed of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
Since train runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat from Kenya have changed on long distances, the record time for Marathon in the last 10 years has fallen by more than 2 minutes since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil won in 1998 in Berlin with the result 2:06:05.
After his victory on Sunday, Gebrselassie told the press that he had spasms in his calf two weeks ago and therefore could not train for a week.
Obviously he has been refreshed after pause and not returned rusted.
"I'm so happy," he told reporters.
"Everything went perfectly.
I resumed training a week ago and still had some concerns today, but in the end everything was great.”
He was criticized for this - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's rivals from East Africa - that he overly orchestrated his races, avoids many world-best marathon stars in general, relies too much on the race leaders, as if that were a track race, and puts world records above the competition.
Yet this criticism hardly hurts the size of Gebrselassies as a long-distance runner.
Accompanied by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie had reached the centre of the track in 1:02:04.
Two elite runners from Kenya, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi have continued to challenge Gebrselassie after the pacemakers slackened.
Just over three miles before the finish, Gebrselassie made his final appearance to split from Kwambai, who has arrived second in 2:05:36, improving his best time by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi finished third in 2:07:48.
For women, Irina Mikitenko, originally from Kazakhstan and now German, has completed a considerable year by showing the seventh fastest result of all time with 2:19:19.
The world record of 2:15:25 holds Paul Radcliff from Great Britain.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko had surprisingly won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the games in Beijing because of problems described as a back injury. However, she has recovered to win in Berlin and improve her best time in her third marathon by five minutes.
She cleverly planned her run by letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan female runners get out, but overtaken after 30 kilometers.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The pride and hardships in the lives of the black people, in a city of a very special kind
Hidden between the outgrowths of the theme parks around Orlando, a few miles from the glittering, loud and gigantic hustle and bustle, lies a quiet city where the pride and complications of African-American culture emerge.
Eatonville, the first entirely black city in the country and the hometown of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as easy to describe as Hurston did in 1935: "the city with 5 lakes, three croquet sites, 300 brown hides, 300 good swimmers, more than enough guavas, 2 schools and no prison."
Nowadays it is a pilgrimage site.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee are to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville came to commemorate the most famous author of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, the city it describes is and will remain – which made it a tourist destination by welcoming it to the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Publicor Project at the time of the Depression – in many ways a place of the very special kind.
Eatonville is as independent, dignified and private as in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural black communities in Florida often refused to share their true thoughts with the white man who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing."
Even today, in a year when a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open conversation about racial relations, many here are still tired of being watched by outsiders.
"We are very careful how our history is told," said Hortense Jones, 59, from birth a resident of the city and a parishioner of the city's oldest church.
It has to be true."
Eatonville has long been defined as the paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is both a historical example of the black movement and a municipality of nearly 2,400 residents, where the poverty rate is twice as high as the national average.
It is, on the one hand, a stronghold of literature and, on the other, an example of the - sometimes condemned, sometimes praised - black culture of the rural south that has its roots in American slavery.
It is not surprising that residents here are both proud and on guard.
And so really did the concerns about Eatonville's image actually start with Zora, as everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown in books that came from the heart and were written in dialect, such as "Mules and Men" (1953) and "Their Eyes were watching God" (1973)
Five paragraphs in the Florida tour guide changed the city, which is very close to Route 77, a road that runs through the often-forgotten center of Florida, to the scenes of black history and human drama.
Cheeky like Oskar in both real life and literature, Hurston led readers to the store of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then turned to more private affairs.
"Away from the street to the left," she wrote, "is the brown --white painted modern school, with its manicured gardens and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, though he can barely read and write."
She also mentioned widow Dash's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of any kind and whatever-always suits hours rooms."
In just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
This was certainly not a travel guide.
In fact, this was not a portrait that was appreciated by everyone.
"Zora described things as they were," according to 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls who immortalized Hurston by quoting the men who sang songs about the her beauty, who were full of sexual allusions.
She added: "Some people didn't like this."
One still remembers Hurtson here as a lively eccentric who returned regularly after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalled that when Hurston came into town, she did so mostly without warning, in a noisy chevrolet, smoking and dressed in pants, in a city that itself is now imagining something on its venerable style of clothing.
According to Mr. Franklin, most of the inhabitants were fascinated, whereas many despised them.
"People were always glad to see Zora," Mr Franklin said.
But "she never stayed too long," he added while rocking in his chair, on a rear-facing terrace that looks out onto Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was in all likelihood baptized.
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books out of print.
Along with much of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten them.
Although she was once a famous author, a contemporary Langstin Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
There was no grand commemoration in Eatonville, no large-scale public readings.
"I don't think they understood their post in the world or their heritage in the slightest," according to Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography about Hurston released in 2003.
The turnaround came in the 1980s.
Orange County authorities wanted to put a five-lane highway through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the municipality's slow two-lane main street.
Orlando's suburbs had already pushed Highway 4 through the western outskirts of the city.
The proposal was made when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fight against racial mixing brought hatred to the community.
"In that time, often a bunch of white boys came and they threw oranges and stuff at the off-seated people," Mr. Franklin said.
"There was even a woman who was killed.
They threw a watermelon out of the car.”
In 1955, in a letter to the Orlando Sentinel, Hurston questioned the Supreme Court's demand to force integration by describing its decision in the Brown case against the school board as "insulting rather than my race."
Residents today say that although the abolition of racial segregation was positive in some respects, it weakened the group cohesion in Eatonville and the self-confidence of its youth.
"Black children were used to being embraced - I remember - you hugged your teacher in the morning and you hugged his teacher in the evening," according to N. Y. Nathiri , daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group for the protection of the Eatonville community.
That could be sustained for so long, she added, until teachers and students stopped coming from the same place.
"You didn't hug his white teacher, because he was a white teacher - I mean there's a cultural divide there," Ms. Nathiri said.
However, civil rights have helped create space for more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who override prejudice, just as she did, with positive self-confidence and statements like, "How can anyone refuse the joy of my society!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker made her way to Hurston's nameless grave and began fighting for the revival of her fame.
Five years later, a much-praised Hurston biography was by Robert E. Finding Hemenway on the bookshelves, and made them a part of the American literary canon again.
The trunk road project came exactly at a time when Eatonville's most famous daughter was once again in the light of public view.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The municipality began planning a Hurston festival in 1988 to show what the district could destroy with the construction of the highway.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and every January many return for the celebration.
A few years later, the district turned away from its road construction plans.
"The plans of a five-lane highway revived the city, accelerated the whole thing at top speed, evoked real citizen pride," Ms. Nathiri said.
Ms. Boyd put it a little easier: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory against the trunk road project has contributed to a change in the city's self-image.
There were more and more arrivals, such as Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who has been going to church here since 1993, and locals began to reappreciate the past.
Eatonville was added to the statewide historic register in 1998.
A new one-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly cobbled and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Nowadays, Eatonville remains a special feature in Florida: just 6 miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes feel like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(It is 90% black nowadays.)
Outsiders in search of the history of Eatonville and its significance are often still treated with caution.
For most interviews, a permit in advance is necessary and certain things - such as the wall painting of Eatonville's oldest church painted by a white man and depicting black men in fieldwork - must not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms Jones, a brave, confident teacher with a fondness for dark red, still fear that their shielded community will be misunderstood.
And yet, at the same time that the Hurston festival grew up, an increased degree of homeland pride was also born.
Young people in particular tend to see Eatonville as Hurston saw their entire race: beautiful, with all its problems, neither worse nor better and just as proud, creative and hardworking, silly and mixed as any other racial and ethnic group in America.
It's the sincere love for this city that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the city government or with the police, who, according to him, could use some help.
And even the younger ones, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park, have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people who just drive through here will think, "Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others," Alondra Kenon said the other day on a Sunday after church.
"But when you actually stop and look at your story for a moment, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, you can speak financial Latin fluently.
At first glance, nothing has changed.
If Manhattan tourists stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the massive television screens in Times Square, they wouldn't even realize they're in the middle of a debacle.
They would never believe that above their heads, in the shoebox-like offices with the glass facades, bankers and hedge fund managers who have the monopoly in New York, have daily the worst horror working day since the 1929 stock market crash.
Suppliers still push the metal tea trucks along sidewalks with loud rattles and carry trays loaded with muffins for the breakfast sessions.
Latinos still shuffled between apartments, like human pack animals loaded with around 50 ironed T-shirts hanging from a yoke-like bar lying on their shoulders.
Office workers are still waiting on their buffet stalls on their sidewalks and it is still impossible to get a yellow taxi on a weekday between 4pm and 7pm.
It didn't feel like a crisis at all until Thursday afternoon, due to all the doomsday talk, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had decided to put my compulsory process on the quiet late afternoon in my JP Morgan Chase regular branch, about 20 people were already in line.
Not at the money switches to withdraw or deposit money, but at the customer service counter where regular customers order checkbooks, ask tourists for directions to the department store Macy's and where new customers open accounts.
Most of them before me, I later learned from Starr, my "personal bank employee with a license," stood in line for the same reason as I did.
Unlike me, however, they had already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks, in places from where they commuted, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had withdrawn money from so-called thrifts (a little resembled a building society), cooperative banks and that local savings bank that have branches only in one state, and say they treat their customers like family.
Last year, 15 of these banks went quietly bankrupt.
Over the past few days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion assets, went into bankruptcy administration and when last Friday New Yorkers drove home over the weekend, was Wachovia, another bank that owns $440 billion worth of savings assets, in search of a saving buyer.
In fear of another collapse, the office and shop employees who stood before me brought their cash to a bank that is considered a safe haven, a bank responsible for most of the rescue purchases on Wall Street.
Normal New Yorkers have acquired fluent financial Latin in recent weeks.
A woman who was on the phone in my Chinese regular supermarket made so much familiarity with Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank and its emaciated-looking chief executive Dick Fuld, as if she were blaspheming about a rotten colleague.
And Lyn, the around 50-year-old uniformed concierge of my apartment block has strayed from our usual entertainment topics about Brad and Angelina and my food delivery.
"I now have all my savings in money market funds," she told me after my visit to the bank.
"I've changed, I don't take a risk anymore."
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon was "Tod" Handley (obituary on the 11th September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for teenagers up to 21 years, but when the choir sang for the last time in 1979, some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological changer of forms) stood for the willingness and ability of the choir to tackle any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and consisted solely thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which never let up for years.
How often did Tod think we were "let the music speak for itself."
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So it sings!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never bossy but also never exuberant.
Whatever the musical level, he always demanded an even higher level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been knighted, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well over the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he ran the Guildford Philharmonic.
For the past 40 years, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can sincerely say that I was never disappointed by a single one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal modesty.
He loathed conductors who, according to his words, simply "peddled with one or two well-known show horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (25. September) write that "in 1946 he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford and in 1950 received a Houblon-Norman research fellowship ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a doctoral degree.
This is a conclusion from an author's remark in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End," but it's not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was a 1950-1951 in the United States in the wake of a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.
Muslim graves desecrated during right-hand slide in Austria
Heinz-Christian Strache, a left-winger of Austria's right-wing Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, a member of Belgian right-wing Pertei Vlaams Belang, take on Thursday, the 17th. January 2008, at a demonstration in Antwerp to represent the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They wear signs in the style of traffic signs on which a mosque is depicted, crossed out with a red line.
Police accuse right-wing extremists of grave desecration at a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend on which far-right parties record significant gains in the country's general election.
In the night from Friday to this morning, more than 90 graves at the cemetery in Traun near Linz were severely damaged in an action organized, according to police.
The perpetrators sprayed Jewish symbols such as the David Stern on some of the graves, but crime investigators consider this an attempt to obscure the motive of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shaken" by the news of the grave desecration that was taking place as the Muslim Ramadan's religious month draws to a close.
At the same time, a round of conscience research is pending in Austria after the country slipped to the right in yesterday's parliamentary election.
The FPÖ and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, the two far-right parties that got almost 30% of the vote, campaigned in their election campaign for a strict anti-immigrant law and some of their election rulings were criticized by opponents as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, chairman of the FPÖ, which won 18% of the vote, campaigned for a ban on headscarves and burqas and even made his aversion to food, which is generally associated with Islam.
At his last rally in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties want to ban the construction of mosques and minarets with the argument that these are political symbols of a continuous Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses conducted immediately after the election, which state that the far right is the politically strongest bloc in the country, suggest that this new development is based on young voters worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Gary Glitter, the glam rock star who has been convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain in court.
Judges slain a six-month ban after informing the authorities controlling him that he wanted to travel to Spain via France.
Police in Kent were granted it last Thursday to impose a foreign travel ban after it presented evidence to the judges of Glitter's criminal record for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford district court in Kent, but was represented by the law firm Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court reported: "On Thursday, the 25th September, the police Kent at the district court of Ashford requested permission, foreign travel of Mr. Paul Glad to France and Spain until the 25. March to prevent.
Paul Gadd was not present in person.”
As required by the Sex Offenders Register, Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad.
He must inform the authorities if he is to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also notify the police 7 days before his scheduled departure.
Failure to notify the authorities could result in a 5-year prison sentence.
Police in Kent said she would not discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible whereabouts in the country.
A spokeswoman for Kent's police unit said: "The police in Kent will do everything necessary to protect children in this country and abroad."
"In our view, it is easier to control someone who is in the UK because we have a comprehensive system to effectively prevent any potential risks."
"It is the top concern of the police in Kent to protect the inhabitants of Kent and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the country in order to minimize any risk that could exist for the population.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abuse of 2 girls, aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he was scheduled to take a flight to London.
But he said he didn't feel well and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not let him through passport control and he flew back and forth to Hong Kong after some.
The Chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and border guards insisted he return to the UK.
Last but not least, he came on 22. Annught at Terminal 3 at Heathrow and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge District Court in west London, as Scotland Yard had successfully asked for approval to request that he register as a sex offender.
Glitter had previously been jailed in 1999 for 4 months in the UK for possession of images of child abuse.
According to the Interior Ministry, Interior Minister Jacqui Smith is reassured and satisfied that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
`I receive the master backstage to capture his character," Günter Brauer, photographer.
No heels, no ruffles, no costumes for the performance.
The nature of the great flamenco dancers who give up concentration and devote themselves to interpretation in order to get a relaxed appearance as a woman or as a man.
On the one hand, artists
On the other hand, personality
I look into private life, into these moments that are foreign to the audience, I know when I can find typical gesture for the personality, the depth of a stolen look or expression strength of the hands that are concerned because they will not enter the stage.
In his project `Flamenco-people', the German photographer Günter Bauer presents varied theatrics of some productions on stage with singers, dancers and guitarists. From this side he was little known for the artists.
With this proposal, the photographer creates a special iconography of flamenco representation on different levels.
The exhibition, which belongs to the program of the month of the flamenco's photography, `reflects the international importance of flamenco, which is getting bigger and bigger from day to day,' explains the artist and makes it clear that `Flamenco-people' can be anyone, but if you look at the photos, the viewer realizes that there are no typical pictures of artists on the stage.
Normal people on the portraits are artists who are able to convey passion, sadness, joy on stage and thus move the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these artists, you don’t have to take pictures on stage.
Her personality and character is in her hearts.
What interested me was to create a personal atmosphere that would allow me to capture the characters of the greatest flamenco masters with the camera.
Bauer, inspired by the `Cante de las Minas' festival, set out on a long journey in 1997 to photograph singers, guitarists or dancers with a digital camera.
Thanks to the image sorting function of the camera and the existing material, images were created that are reminiscent of classical photography.
The application of various stylistic means destroys the classical foundation of the image, whereby the image is given the modernity and the idea of how the farmer Flamenco understands: `Music with traditional roots that changes and surprises every day'.
These are not only the dance, the singing or the instrumental play itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, who seduces the audience with his art.
The search for the essential, for a certain something, which becomes visible in the form of hearing, of being, is and was the fixed goal of this work, which will be presented in the gallery of the El Fotómata in the near future.
Well-known personalities in flamenco among them Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo and others are among the narrow selection of the nearly seventy artists who were photographed.
The project became an anthology of flamenco and will soon appear as a book, with all the portraits from the exhibition.
Bauer’s passion for the portraits led him to take up this idea again two years ago and to realize it as `Portraits of the Veterans of Sport’ (`SportARTproject’).
Although the concepts of the project `Flamenco-people' are different, so the photographer admits to `I like to photograph the people, get to know them and put me in their state of life, whether for a short moment or a longer time.
I think that in the field of photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or meet people, personalities you sometimes don’t know at all, or they leave you alone for a few minutes to take a photo.
Apart from these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.'
The collection of the portraits of the flamenco of today entitled `Flamenco-people' is on display in the gallery of El Fotómata, which is located in the street called la calle de la Mata and runs parallel to the street la Alameda de Hércules. The exhibition can be until 16. Visiting October.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the Roma he is writing is `a foolishness'.
He does not yet know where the story of the novel takes place and what it is about, but, Mario Vargas Llosa persistently tries to advance the project he is currently working on, a novel with the protagonist Roger Casemant, a nationalist from Ireland who lived in the Congo for twenty years and moved to the Amazon.
Yesterday, during his presence at the Hay Festival Segovia, the preferred Nobel laureate admitted that the project he is dealing with is `a foolishness' and 'everything points out that he would not have to write the novel'.
`If I were level-headed, I wouldn't have done it, but I'll do it and hope to finish the novel at some point,' so he concluded his participation in the festival, where the ideas, thoughts and words were exchanged. Within the four days, he has seen hundreds of writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people who were in Segovia.
The author of `La ciudad y los perros' was one of the most outstanding personalities at the third festival and made predictions.
Vargas Llosa, who has won premium from the Hay Festival and to whom most of those present gave her vote, is compared to the old edition of `Our mutual friend' and can be seen in the Juan Bravo Theatre.
He was introduced by Félix Romeo and found that he had an audience in front of him, which realized that the Peruvian, who has a wonderful memory and a great sense of humor, was not given enough time to be able to go through everything again: how his vocation to literature arose, which emerged from `exceptional adventurousness', from `joy in reading' and from `more than before'Numerous corrections and revisions he makes; how Faulkner, Víctor Hugo and Alejandro Dumas influenced his vocation and what `memory images' it is that form the basis of his stories.
The Hispanic-American novelist acknowledged that there is `no way' in which you can measure and how to know if books change life, `but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, a fleeting experience,'" emphasized Vargas Llosa, who claims that it does not cause `effects' and `puts people apart even more'...
At the festival in Pozoblanco, the weather did not play along: bull fighting festivals were partially cancelled.
After the announced bullfighters found that the ground of the pitch was in poor condition, the bullfighting festival with which the festival in Pozoblanco was to be concluded was moved to yesterday morning.
Thus, the organizer, with the consent of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, has decided to postpone the bullfighting festival.
Thus, the festival was exposed to the unstable weather, which is why two out of three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, it rained, which is why the second planned bullfighting festival could not be celebrated.
The Matador group consisted of José Luis Moreno, Curro Días and Juan Bautista, who gradually entered the bullring.
So there was only a celebration on Friday.
The winner there was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and triumphed, after which he had left the passage with pleasure and aesthetics.
That same evening, Alejandro Talavante hit two horns and an ear of the bull, which he had succeeded more by galloping than by his bullfighting art.
And even worse was El Juli, who went through the Arena de Los Llanos without difficulty, but also without fame.
After he fought so badly, much of the audience responded with boo-calls in his second fight.
In Álava, two people wanted to escape the control of their car, which was loaded with two thousand kilos of hashish.
Tomorrow: five minutes before ten.
Traffic controls in Ertzaintza, in the urban area of Armiñon (Álava).
Two police officers asked the drivers of the car to stop, after which they fled.
It looked like they didn't have to stop with the load of more than two thousand kilos of hashish.
Police tracked her down and arrested one of the drivers, the man, who is 28 years old, known as A. A. J., as announced by the Ministry of the Interior of the Basque State.
The arrested person was accused of drug trafficking and forgery of official documents.
The incident occurred when the officers of the Álava region's traffic police had already completed traffic control on the N-1 and were driving past the urban area of Armiñon.
They decided to stop a car to carry out the route control. The driver did not follow the instructions, suddenly increased the speed and tried to escape control.
The police began the pursuit until the car stopped after a few kilometers on the edge strip. At the moment, drivers got out of the car to flee across a country road into a wooded area.
The police of the city of Ertzaintza finally caught up with one of the two. In the car, an Iveco Daily, the drug traffickers transported 2,178 kilos of hashish, which was seized by the police.
The front part of the car was loaded with hashish bundles, which were later directed to other police departments for accurate laboratory analysis and for weighing the bundles.
In addition, the officials found that the license plate was `double', so that it did not match the license plate specified in the vehicle papers, which is why an arrest was also made for forgery of official documents.
Ertzaintza City Police are continuing the investigation to carry out the arrest of the second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to flee, but also to determine the origin of the drugs seized.
The arrested 28-year-old A. A. J., was taken to a police station for questioning. He will be presented to the magistrate in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear have been arrested for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
Actress Heather Locklear, known for the role of Amanda from the series "Melrose Place," was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the effect of an unknown drug.
A witness had observed how she tried in a rather strange way to get out of her parking space in Montecito, reported spokesman for the traffic police of California the magazine `People'.
The witness told in detail that Locklear pushed through 'after 16:30, pushing through accelerator and making a lot of noise by trying to move her car backwards or forward out of the parking space, and as she drove backwards, she grabbed her sunglasses a few times.'
A little later, the witness, who initially had probably not recognized the actress, saw that Locklear was stopping on a nearby road and getting out of the car.
The witness was the person who notified the emergency service because she was `fear of living for locklears'.
When the police patrol arrived, they found the actress sitting in her car, which was standing across the street, blocking traffic.
`She seemed disoriented,' that's why they took the police to a special drug and alcohol center to take a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress showed up cooperatively, excessive alcohol consumption was ruled out from the first moment. `According to the first observations of the officials, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of an unknown drug,' according to the spokesman.
Locklear was arrested under suspicion of driving under the influence of an indefinite substance that could not be determined and was taken to local custody around 7 p.m.
Two months ago, Locklaer was discharged from the clinic in Arizona after receiving treatment, where she was treated for anxiety and depression.
Llamazares insists that the United Left Association of the United Left will be in charge of the Silva case.
Gaspar Llamazares, the main coordinator of the VL and MP of the United Left, has today assured that the regional association for education will be the one to make the decision in the case of the former City Council for Youth and Sport of the City Hall in Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of doing business with family members.
`In such cases, I am a great federalist, and the Andalusian organization will be the one who has to take over the responsibility for this," Llamazares pointed out what approach the party must have towards the one who has to sit as a city councillor on the Seville municipal council until now.
Nevertheless, the chairman of the VL defended the necessity of `transparency' in the possible investigations of the rule violations, which Silva may have started: `The VL always insisted that such cases receive maximum transparency'.
With regard to this issue, he stressed that education has 'a strict ethical code for all public office'.
`Sangre de mayo': Hero's Book by Garci
Inspired by `Episodios Nacionales' by Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Carci in `Sangre de mayo' represents the revised version of the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French. This is an admirable film in filmography, with about 15 million euros investment for the filming.
In this way, the Cineast has tried to portray `a lot of personalities and social analysis', which he had always admired in the works of the famous novelist, Carci explained today at the presentation of the film with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría at the beginning of a long directory of the performers.
`Sangre de mayo' with a film length of more than two and a half hours, will be presented in cinemas this Friday and later shown on the channel Telemadrid as a four-hour miniseries.
José Luis Garci, a big fan of the literature of Galdós, assures that thanks to this filming, his `childhood dream' came true. This he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago from the autonomous community of Madrid, a memorial film for the second century celebration on 2. November to shoot in Madrid. Especially because the story is based on `Episodios Nacionales', he accepted the mission.
The total contribution of 15 million, which was put for filming by the autonomous community of Madrid, offers Garci, as he inflicted, the `one-off possibility' with the help of decorations and corresponding clothing the image of 'confused Spain, which selected the wrong leader for the struggle, because the people had been brought into arrears by the struggle for independence and under the rule of the Ferdinand of VII'.
However, the Cineast regrets that the financing could not be expected, as with `Alatriste' or `Los fantasmas de Goya' (twice as high as with `Sangre de mayo'), so some scenes from the script could not be shot with Horacio Valcárcel, with which Garci worked almost his entire career.
For this reason, Garci, who was also film director in `Volver a empezar', contributed through his usual way of working: he stood on stage to the actors with whom you first have to rehearse before you start shooting and for those who had not done casting, he appeared `humiliating' and respecting, `part of the profession of film director is to provide help in the theater and in the cinema
Many performers he encounters in `Sangre de mayo' must be repeated in front of his camera, as in the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garci, an Oscar candidate in four nominations (of which he won one), is of the opinion and assured that none of the three candidates representing Spain before the Academy of Hollywood this year is a young generation of Spanish filmography. Neither `Sangre de mayo', nor `Siete mesas de billar francés' and finally not the selected film `Los girasoles ciegos'.
For this film, Garci does not expect any awards.
`In the beginning, you believe that you work for the progeny, later you realize that it is only for the flourishing, and now you are satisfied when you have produced another film," explains Garci after more than 30 years of professional activity.
Isabel Bayón recalls the memory of the dancer from Seville Tórtola Valencia
A flamenco dancer from Seville reveres a dancer who is also from Seville.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia: her father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the mother Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), she was born in the Triana district and when she was three years old, her family moved to London.
She was a dancer and expert on oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, she was one of the first female fighters for the emancipation of the woman, such as Isadora Ducan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist, vegetarian, and advocated the abolition of the corset, which restricted free female movement.
The life of this woman, who left her mark on the dance and aesthetics revolution in Europe in the time between the wars, fascinated Isabel Bayón.
`I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this role to me, which seemed impossible to me.'
`We are not trying to tell about her life, but to preserve her spirit,' said the flamenco dancer.
Your dance basics have helped me a lot in flamenco.
`The dance of the butterfly' seemed to me, for example, like Guajira, or `the dance of the snake' like tango.
Her dancing was sensual and I was told that my dancing is also within this aesthetic realm," she claims.
The production expects two extraordinary collaborations: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing again for Isabel at one of her performances, as he did in `La puerta abierta'; and with flamenco master Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work together with one of her ex-students.
`Matilde plays Tórtola, a very mature personality.
I am happy because she agreed to participate in my work and I am very honored.'
The production also reckons with musical composition and the guitarists Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; with the percussion of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa el Viola and the collaboration with the actor Juanfra Júarez, he `takes on the role of the companion of the artists
This work also tells in a certain way about the life of this woman, who became known in such far-reaching places as India, the United States or Russia and also throughout Europe, even though she usually lived in London.
`I wanted to remind her, because I think she is one of the women who have an enormous influence on a certain epoch and whose works today no one appreciates anymore and therefore appreciates them even less,' Bayón asserts.
The performance will take place today at 20:30 at the Theater Lope de Vega.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
`I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino `Flamenco and Life' because his photographs are fantastic in black and white, in documentary style.
They made me aware of them because of their simplicity and because of the power they radiate, how they always deal with respect with the protagonists.
An exhibition that shows a lot of feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.'
The publication of the book `Diario de un poeta recién casado' also includes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of `Diario de un poeta recién casado' in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), in a place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in 1916, offers a corresponding atmosphere to carry out planned activities on behalf of the Andalusian Council for Culture, to celebrate the `Trennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' (2006-2008) The aim is to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the award ceremony of the Nobel Prize for Literature and the anniversary of the death of the two.
Thus, `the Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramón' is concluded with the new edition of this work, with the international congress taking place in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of Juan Ramón Jiménez-Zenobia and with the travelling exhibition `Juan Ramón Jiménez: `Aquel chopo de luz', which was opened in MayCongresses will be presented.
The Andalusian Council for Culture has also received eight hundred copies of `Diario de un poeta recién casado', which were published by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Pacobo Pérez-Enciso. The goal is to make the person and the work of the Andalusian world poet better known.
The U.S. can't imagine it badly without Paul Newman
`Sometimes God creates perfect personalities.
Paul Newman was one of them.'
This sentence comes from the actress Sally Field, who worked with him in `Sensational Reporter', and from the then prevailing performance of the American cinema, which was abandoned, came from all over America to Newman with his inspiring performance and followed her.
Look what it cost him to give him the Oscar.
And when he retired in 2007.
And he knew he was very sick.
Still, that was a big blow for everyone.
`What one sometimes feels is substantially more than an expression, and now I have lost a great friend,' said Robert Redford, crying, `my life and my country were the greatest drolls of his life.'
No one was afraid of ridiculing or exaggerating.
As the `father' of cinema and the fatherland, he died at a sad moment when there is fear of terrorists and of the market collapse, in which the dejected self-esteem of the Americans in the hopeless search for reasons to regain dignity is.
If in this hard time without virtue few people you can admire remain, so you don't necessarily have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied a platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was the official enemy of Richard Nixon and, like various losses, suffered both profits: from the foundation, which is committed to the fight against drugs and was founded in honor of his son from the first marriage who died of overdose to his own brand of homemade and organic products.
This is all a gift for the country, where it took a lot of effort to prevail against a deadly food culture.
A broad wave of wonderment strikes house-high over Hollywood without regard to nationalities and nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, confirmed that not only one person has died, but the whole era.
Englishman Sam Mendes, film director and Oscar winner, said working with Newman was no more or nothing less than the top of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad boy who came from Australia, dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"The greatest of us has left us," confirmed George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today try to live like Paul Newman lived: high demands on righteousness, a responsible private life, far from the cameras.
This is not always easy or not even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there's someone trying, and Paul Newman was an example of that.
He divorced once and was married to Joanne Woodward for fifty years afterwards, who he was loyal to, although there were certainly many opportunities not to be.
`Why should I eat a hamburger on the street when I have filet at home?', he often joked himself.
In heaven, he will be proud that on earth his daughters have the same opinion as his fans, which is not necessarily common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, he was not as proud of as that of the faithful spouse, the loving father, the attentive grandfather, and that of the philanthropist,” they say.
For the Olympics, the streets in Madrid are deficient.
Yes, the dream of many of us is to host some Olympic disciplines in Madrid, after the failure for 2012, it may be maybe 2016.
But I wonder, `Are we prepared for this?'
Yes, we follow the example of the old streets, I say that it is not true!
She was called the perfect road, and in my opinion, she was the worst road with everything around it.
Of course, that's a lot of nonsense, if you were to pay attention to the assessment and I could check it, something like this clearly would not have come through.
But, let's go through everything from the beginning.
The nonsense starts with the ticket pickup that allows you to be the first to go.
It doesn’t seem bad to me either, but if they already let you go, then they should give you everything (including chip to avoid the traffic jams on the road).
So not, so not.
Here they only let you get the ticket (the first nonsense that consists in going there only because of it) and (after an infinite queue) there is the surprise! The T-shirt was only available in the size `S' (a second nonsense, because I need the size XL)
Where do we actually live?
Or is it that after the crisis, only small, much cheaper shirts made of less fabric were decided to buy?
All right, things like this are a trifle compared to the days on the street.
Apart from the fact that you have to go very early to get the chip, there is already a queue of at least 15 minutes and, besides, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait has taken more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible in the case of a road where 11 000 people are expected.
Finally, as was to be expected, the road started and we had not left our backpacks in front of it, even if it had once succeeded, but bringing it back would be more difficult.
In addition, it looked, in these 40 minutes waiting time after rain, so that it came to the temptation to organize a popular uprising and to raid the cottage.
I think tomorrow will surely have some 500 people pneumonia and some like me will not even appear in time at the classification because of this chip I received, I can already imagine that the exit has been stamped incorrectly.
Of course, if I were asked for a perfect road, this road would never come to mind.
So I believe we will dream for a long time about a city that is well prepared for the Olympics
Microsoft looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the `Emerging Technology Conference', hosted by MIT, Microsoft presented the progress of the new image recognition system and human interaction, a being of artificial intelligence without much intelligence, but capable of completing some primitive tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, this is a route planner to move around the company's campus). The system takes into account what it hears during the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and facial recognition system, this `receptionist' can see how many people are in the room, who they are and even remember how they were clothed, it can listen and understand the keywords of their conversation.
It can also place those present in the groups after the talks.
In the presentation video, `the receptionist' notices a third person, but she understands that this person is not a member of the group that is talking to him, and that there is no company employee.
She asks if the person here wants to visit someone and responds that she will be listening soon.
All without the blue screenshot
Impressive
This is certainly the future.
Now the company has better stuff to focus on, for example, on the next version of their Windows operating system.
This week was very superficial about Microsoft's change of strategy.
Windows 7 will be faster and not have as many integrated programs.
Steve Ballmer noted that if the computers were equipped with the most necessary, rather than filling them with the commercial garbage, they would work five times faster. Man, Steven, that's only gonna be for the few.
Everything is just a statement considering that Microsoft added one or the other function and `Tools' in Windows versions.
The change of direction is worth it
The Microsoft is right, the operating system is gradually losing importance, just like the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, it was part of the theory that it was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many cleverly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system, as an indispensable part, will always be necessary for hardware and software to work at the same time.
The operating system performs the function that can be compared to the function of his wife or husband when it comes to communicating something to his mother-in-law.
That's true.
The system will never disappear, but one must think of his `death', not as an absolute, but as relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week is confirming that idea.
People pay less attention to the operating system every time, but more to the web browser.
The computer is only started to run the Firefox, the Explorer or Chrome and every day we spend more time browsing than in the environment of the `windows'.
What is half of the computer of existing applications for?
Less is more
And Windows 7 needs to be more compact, much more compact than Vista.
Lighter, not so exaggerated, less complicated.
Microsoft's interest is more to integrate its online services, which can eventually become the alternative to Google.
In reality, they need that, no doubt. I'm bringing a little example of that.
The photo of this place I took in Redmond, in one of the recreation rooms for Microsoft employees earlier this month.
A sign is attached to the soft drink machine: `Your search. Our future'. It prints out a request to use your own tool for online search.
In 2006, an independent study concluded that the 66% of employees at Microsoft, Google used for research on the net.
By the way, last week it was also confirmed that the new version of the Windows Mobile 7 has been delayed.
It will not appear at the beginning, but at the end of 2009, rather even in 2010.
Microsoft is looking for the ability to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 to the mark at the same time.
Every day the phone turns into a computer.
The Android and the iPhon are already on the market, but the other delay will cost money.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso has it on in Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio had this brand on in `Blood Diamond' by Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in `The Godfather' by Francis Ford Coppola. At the same time, it belongs to clothing of a well-built pastor.
When we start to list the countless Stars performances, we can draw on the image of a very strong man, with a pointed beard that had lifted up heavyweights in a traveling circus.
Basically, this is a typical male t-shirt made of cotton, sleeveless and waisted.
The English speakers call it `tank'. However, Lle Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles outperforms all other brands.
First, because of its great name, although it is called `Marcel' in a narrow circle. Legend has it that the name is associated with sports and comes from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
`La Marcel' towers over everyone because of his excellent cotton, because of his distinguishing unisex cut and is characterized by a small Belgian flag (hardly recognizable) that these T-shirts have as a detail on the neckline.
And beware, the Belgian company is not only focused on the production of `tanks'.
They also have college sweatshirts, boxer retro, cardigans and cashmere, cotton trousers, T-shirts with stripes, babies, mini shorts
Modeled and comfortable underwear.
Although, it is a great shame to use them as underwear.
They are very delightful.
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda captures the marketing of the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large-capacity sedan offers even larger ones.
In addition, there are also the technical intricacies that allow even more convenient driving and gasoline savings.
Changes before the upcoming revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made in this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics are to be emphasized.
Still, before you start analyzing the new model, you have to say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda managed to renew this model for a shorter time compared to the other manufacturers.
Although the Honda Jazz is less well known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sale in the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of the year in 2002 and also during the course of this year 2008.
After jazz was released on the market, about one million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second sales market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Even so, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japanese company sold a total of 83 000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10 000 cars. This is 17 % of the assumed growth in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8 000 jazz models since 2002. This is 6.7% of the total sale at Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2 000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales cut in Spain.
In reality, the brand's leaders hope to complete the year with a total sale of 22 000 models. This is 4 000 fewer cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16 %.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda is counting on the appearance of a new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200 000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first few months of the year, with the first time its public presentation will be held in Valencia in January.
In view of the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its greats.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axles is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Together with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due on the one hand to the new room flexibility program and on the other hand, the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of Jazz.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading space, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the trunk of the first generation.
It must be emphasized that these measures are in place in the version with a 1.4-litre petrol engine, because the capacity of the Honda Jazz's trunk with a 1.2-litre petrol engine is 379 litres.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment elements such as leather seats or the possibility to install panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the petrol engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which enables low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high-torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first variant with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp with 6 000 rotations with maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of petrol consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
In view of the previous engine, which reached 83 hp in the earlier generation, it now manages to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 hp model 1.4 has 5.4 liters of gasoline consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
`I want to be a young mother; I'm not worried about the candidate'
Her great demeanor with her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Mónica Cruz is petite, but full of joie de vivre.
Currently, the siblings Gruz take their new activity in fashion very seriously.
For Mónica, this means much more than for some pretty and rich girls who keep their reputation.
She was in Paris at the promotion of the company Mango, moved to it and also makes the presentation of the most important premiums in fashion, which the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Merciful and shy, winner on the short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection for this autumn/winter season, which my sister Penélope and I designed for Mango, and I also attended the presentation of the second edition of `Mango Fashion Awards' and participated in Valentino's dinner.
A very intense working time that is exciting at the same time.
You work for the Spanish house, what is the basis of your new collection for the fourth season for Mango?
My sister, both I are fascinated by the cinema of the 50's and 60's; there we find a lot of ideas.
I like to walk through a city and watch women clothed, how they combine their garments, I often do.
Dancer, actress and fashion designer, you're a very versatile woman, right?
I believe yes, but finally, everything meets in one and these areas have a lot in common.
Since I was little, I've been excited about the clothes; I've always wanted to go to my grandmother to rummage around in my aunt's wardrobes and see her clothes.
That was great to go almost better than to a theme park.
Later, as a dancer, I always tried to pay attention to the clothes.
You know, we dancers like it so much to have our own style in class and at rehearsals to look in the mirror and feel good about it.
As an actress, when you get the costume, you put yourself in the real actor role.
Finally, everything is connected, it is so, a lot of respect for the costume designer and her professionalism.
Recently you turned 30, have you not fallen into crisis?
Oh, what.
I feel better than I ever, as a thirty-year-old I feel good.
I think the woman is getting mature, has experience and can enjoy life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not afraid of my biological clock.
I wanted to do the things I've been doing since I was little and that gave me a lot of inner joy.
So, you think about becoming a mother, don't you?
For a long time I have known that I am a mother, because that requires my body and besides, I want to be a young mother; I don't want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried about that.
I will convey great happiness to my child and raise him with a lot of love.
As for filmmaking, keep in mind the work you took part in and the last year was shot.
That's exactly how it is and I want them to be presented to the public.
I, as a woman who comes from the theatre, am very impatient and restless and want to have everything at once, which of course cannot be immediate.
I very much wish that `La última hora' and `En busca de la tumba de Cristo' will be performed for the first time.
Let's see how you like them
A few days ago, you appeared on the running with Naomi Campbell, right?
It's okay, don't say that.
It's not like I went on the running climb to model.
Naomi Campbell, whom I have known for some time, simply called and invited me to London to attend a parade for her organization’s charity event `Women for a Better World' and the clothes we show. I know that two garments from our collection for mango have been auctioned to raise the money for Naomi's NGO.
People don't know Naomi's good heart.
There are a lot of things being told about her. I, as the one she knows, would tell you that they're not right.
Still, I will support this good cause in which she is involved.
She asked me to attend the parade for this big-hearted cause, but if she comes and asks me to make a handstand, I will do that, too.
To support the women in the Third World, which is also necessary.
`car bee' that avoids collisions
In order to promote the development of accident prevention technologies, Nissan was inspired by nature this time, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the swarming behaviour of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the technical development center of the Nissan Motor Co. have developed this small robot in cooperation with Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety shield.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds up its own oval-shaped flight space, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important are the facet eyes of the bee, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, which allows it to fly undisturbed in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to recreate the all-round perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are in front of the BR23C at a distance of up to two meters and are within a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into a signal for the avoidance of the collision
`The moment obstacle is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels 90o or even larger angles to avoid the collision.
The biggest difference from other arbitrary systems is that this evasive maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If it were not so, the robot might not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the senior engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, but neither can it move over; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways the bees do.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotation function in addition to acceleration and braking functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
`This device only requires every few seconds to process the information and to act according to this information.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuvers made, so it can continuously work with only a few dozens of KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan predicts to introduce in the next decade in the production cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to guide up to the destination when driving, avoiding the obstacles on the way.
The motorists, who can relapse because of the alcohol level, will have to install the `Alcolock'.
The agency orders that the driver, who had three official penalties for alcohol levels, installs in his car this system, which prohibits him from starting the car in a drunken state. If he's alcoholic, the car won't start.
The initiative was announced last month in June and is already part of the report of the Attorney General's Office. According to them, it is a pilot project that will take a year.
The purpose is the resocialization of the driver, which is why he gets a course for the re-education of traffic behavior.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office, experience has shown that the Ministry of Transport and the Foundation of the Technical Institute for the Safety of Automobiles will also take part.
According to statistics, between 30-75% of motorists who were charged more than once because of driving under the influence of alcohol, put themselves back on the wheel.
The `alcolock' would prevent that because it is a system connected to the car, it measures the alcohol content in the exhaled air and prevents autostart if the driver has taken an alcohol test; or if an alcohol concentration is detected higher than allowed.
It costs more than 1 000 euros, the costs are borne by the person who imposes the sanction.
In this context, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that cars equipped with these devices prevent up to 65% of the rule violations in the first year after its introduction.
In Spain, it is expected that it could be saved 115 lives a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to tackle this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate their implementation, a lawful reform can be realized by the ordinary means, and yet a reform of the Basic Law is called for, which is necessary for the law enforcement process.
The device is not yet available in the Spanish markets, in any business, although it has already been installed in some commercial vehicles and public transport vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the House of Representatives will vote because of the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, which proposes to install this system in school buses. This has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without `peep-toes'
With British punctuality, at 5:40 p.m., at the time provided by the program, next to the presidential hangar of Benito Juárez de México DF airport, the plane of the Spanish Air Force, with which the prince and princess of Asturias landed.
The sun went down, but their rays have still forced to use the hand as a parasol to see the royal couple getting out of the plane.
Directly on the gangway: the Spanish ambassador and other authorities
A few hours before, I had asked a taxi driver on the street if he knew that the prince and princess of Asturias were visiting the city to formalize the official trip.
- Ah, very good, so, you can't take people at the airport at this time of day. You're from here or something
No, she's the Spanish woman, but she's lived here for a couple of years.
-Oh, very well
But the Mexican press knows exactly who the prince and princess of Asturias are and know the importance of the trip.
It is many who wait in the hangar of the airport and on the red carpet, including military protection of 27 Navy soldiers who hand over the salvo of honor.
The prince appears smiling, clothed in navy blue, and she, the princess, with long hair blown by the wind, without ordinary `peep-toes', perhaps told her that a thunderstorm is expected in DF.
Before entering the hall, they smile and are prepared for the photographers where the official entourage awaits.
At the door of the hotel where they are housed, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television, who likes to joke, is waiting for her.
She's shaking before she gets charged with a mortgage.
It must be seen that the Treasury Department of the United States, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide the support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the U.S. citizens getting caught up in mortgage stories of the supposedly solvent banks, a fun and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel,' it says.
Or maybe, the `hotel of bad credit' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times whether it is the moment to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
She certainly has useful information, but without details.
That's more of a side for the teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
The best premium of fashion
Probably there was no more suitable place in the world than Paris to present a premium of fashion and there was probably no substantially excellent fashion designer and bonvivants than Valentino.
Mango presents the second edition of the fashion competition `el Bóton-Mango Fashion Adwards' to promote and internationally increase young fashion talent.
This is awarded with a cash prize of 300 000 euros.
Ayer Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, saw her drawings yesterday in the shop window of the Mango branch on Boulevard Haussmann number 54 in Paris and almost cried because of the emotional excitement.
By the way, this is the second largest business of the company in Europe and was recently opened. It offers a sales area of 1 335 m2.
The biggest business is in London.
So many events have happened that are associated with thanking the fashion designer Valentino for his jury chairmanship in the competition. It all ended with a luxury dinner at Opera National de Paris.
Into the surroundings of many famous people, the board table organized by Mango seemed spectacular.
Nati, with the heavy heart that was broken by pain because his brother recently died, is tearing up. He put the suit on from the fashion house and had some jewelry from ELAH that was stunning. He held on to the arm of his son Luis, who is almost two meters tall and accompanied Valentino at the dinner, in his honor.
Andik, the owner and master of the Mango house, greeted the guests and was such a cavalier, so that he ended with the Baron von Rotschild without jackets, because jackets they lent to the ladies.
Mónica Cruz, has rushed to the store and had a pair of trousers and a shirt, which she modeled herself, and for dinner she wore a long, black sexy dress. During a night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us a hall for ballet rehearsals, so she got into excitement, remembered the old times, grabbed a pole and made a kind of `grand plie'.
Inés Sastre, did not join the walk through the premises of the palace, but before that she had shown us the photos of her son on the mobile phone.
The next morning we could look forward to the presence of Oliver Martínez, a personality who always provokes a stormy enthusiasm, and to Jon Travolta, who after his arrival (with his own bed varnishes and towels) at the Hotel Internacional in Paris, asked in advance to have a room without smells.
The stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh la la, that's life.
1001 advice against stress
There is not 1000, but a more way to forget chaotic everyday life.
And if there are also few, everyone is collected in a book in which it says how to come to relaxation. The book comes to the bookshops on 30. September.
The alarm clock is a punishment when it rings at 7 a.m., but even worse the idea of getting back into the hectic rhythm that current life demands seems even worse.
The office is called the tension and the computer that leads to the back pain.
Stress is the evil of 21. century.
But there are not one and not two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the problems of how to switch off from the world of work.
However, the number is increasing, no more and no less than up to 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, the classic massage or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott presents in the book the whole list of possibilities adapted to the taste and time of each individual.
The work against the stress is called `1001 possibilities to relax' and so the peace and quiet that the book conveys comes to the bookshops of the publishing house Pearson Alhambra and DK.
Anyone who thinks that it is impossible to achieve calm in the areas such as workplace with the help of personal contacts, this handbook refutes such faith.
In addition, the methods of staying in contact with nature or the 100% natural recipes that lead to relaxation are offered.
When the adrenaline in your veins no longer rises to restore balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, the moment has come to sit down on the sofa, turn off the brain and focus on reading.
Talking in your sleep
Some children speak at night
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the children who speak during sleep.
When it happens to you for the first time, at best you will be terrified, but in reality that has no meaning.
This is a positive sleep disorder called speaking in sleep.
It is quite common, especially among children and young people.
Certainly, more than one of you was told that you spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur occasionally (once in a lifetime, for example, such as during the high fever), or regularly (every day, once a week, once a month), the next day the child can remember nothing.
There is no single reason that causes this phenomenon.
Often, connections are sought with other phenomena in sleep, such as nightmares, panic fear at night, enuresis noctura (bedwetting at night), speaking in sleep, but there is no reason for it.
As we have mentioned earlier, it can be due to very high fiber, stressful situations or overwhelm.
In any case, that's a little-researched phenomenon.
The frequency with which it occurs is very variable.
It may be that you speak calmly in individual words, whisper or it can be quite the opposite (crying, crying, long discussions).
In cases when the utterance is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to consult with a specialist to check whether there is a problem that causes anxiety and thus occurs.
We have said that it is a positive disorder, so it is not treated, be it, it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, with sleep apnea or with stress).
What you can do is perform a series of simple preventive measures:
Do not try to excite the child before sleeping.
So, choose quiet play for the child and avoid stressful television programs that are terrible and a bit too wild.
In the nervous children who are recommended relaxation, relaxation methods can be used to help them get a certain inner peace.
This helps the child to sleep peacefully.
Once speaking occurs in your sleep, try to keep calm.
Remember that it is harmless for the child and the next day it will not be able to remember anything that happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake it up.
This is useless, because the child is unconscious, so you will tear it out of sleep.
Even though the child is talking, he sleeps, so he rests.
Remember, if it is scared after a pair of appearances, it is recommended to seek advice or to find out what reason the child has for fear.
If they understand what it says (which is not so ordinary), the child does not press pressure to conduct an interrogation and get out more information.
So you will not be able to achieve anything because when the child sleeps, he is unconscious and cannot think about it.
Besides, you’ll hear what it says, but you won’t know what it’s dreaming and why it says it, so be careful with the interpretation of the information and the conclusions you draw from it.
Maybe, it doesn't tell the child that you hear that at night and know his secrets.
Not even as a joke.
That causes a lot of fear.
So, don't worry, it's nothing bad, this is a moment that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhäuser ... finally
After a long stretch of thirst, Illhäuser is finally back on track for success on the pitch.
Without much effort, the Yellow-Blacks scored numerous chances to score and managed to implement one of them, and thus win the game.
The pace of this encounter, in which the attackers struggled to show their skills, was not very high.
After a first attack by the guest captain Kauffmann, whose long-range shot went just past the angle, Illhäuser should easily dominate the game, and it was alternately possible to challenge the defense of Denmark with a long-range shot, then brain with a high pass, and Romain with a shot with the tip of the foot.
The opposing squad blocked in the middle of the field, leaving only the lively Riahi at the top of the storm through.
The start of the second half should be decisive with initially two goal chances won by Riahi and Temporale, and immediately afterwards with the first goal for the Illhäuser by Marais, who stood just right to accept a ball again, which had been repelled in a first attempt by Diebold.
But the Illäusian goal scorer should not be able to enjoy his luck for long and be sent to the bench about twelve minutes later, which allowed his team-mates to continue playing in a numerically inferior.
Denmark, however, did not know how to take advantage of this and did not face any major problems facing an Illhaeusian eleven, which only withdrew a little to 'condense' their defence, except in the very last seconds of the game in which the ball passed very close to the bar after a big mess.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before he flies to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make another detour to Brittany.
Given the determined stance of the fishermen who blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports on Monday, the French president decided to arrive at the port of Guilvinec in the Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet with their representatives.
The latter promised to receive him `with a constructive spirit', and hope that he will come with `concrete proposals'.
The President's visit takes place at the same time as a general meeting of the crisis committee, established by the Breton fishermen, to enforce measures in light of the extreme rise in the price of diesel, which has reached a record average of over 1.14 euros per litre.
According to the spokesman of the Elysee Palace David Martinon `the president will discuss with them possible solutions to help their companies become competitive again, and to secure the workplace conditions and the pay of the sailors'.
Sarkozy is expected by the fishermen with determination.
Tuesday morning, they led protest marches in the Morbihan and Calvados, which caused traffic jams of nearly ten kilometers in length.
Quiberon's sailing port was also blocked, but the links to Belle-île did not break off.
The Quiberon peninsula was delineated with a barrier.
Already on Monday, the sailors expressed their determination by burning from the early morning on tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement expanded to other ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonnes, in Vendée, where the fishing boats did not go out, or Le Havre, where about twenty boats blocked the manoeuvres of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of Turballe and Croisic in Loire-Atlantique broke up the blockade of the important total refinery in Donges in the evening.
The one from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait out the course of Wednesday's meeting at the ministry before deciding on possible measures.
In fact, the crisis committee in Guilvinec must decide on the responses to the movement and its participation in the discussion planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by those in charge of the national fisheries committee, which has not supported their movement.
`The strike will continue', because `the fishermen will not give in on any point' and `do not want to go to Paris', announced Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Committee, for example.
The professional fishermen who do not pay taxes on diesel currently cost the liter about 50 cents, but they think that the profitability limit of a boat can only be reached with diesel for less than 30 cents per liter.
Paul Newman the Wonderful
The unforgettable actor from `Butch Cassidy and the Kid' died at the age of 83 from the consequences of cancer at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or Sam Mendes said goodbye to the cinema legend and the dedicated actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer holds its supply forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft delivered this year, despite the looming recession, as a threat to the global economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, is complying with its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, reaffirmed its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado.
In the first half of the year, the aircraft manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer is hoping for much from the Chinese market, especially for its aircraft of the order of 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would consider handing over more than 15% of its assets
According to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times, the insurer American International Group, which was financially supported by the U.S. Monetary Authority, is considering handing over more than 15% of its assets to repay the 85 billion dollars it has received.
AIG is ready to drive to the sale of much of its business, beyond its international life insurance and its retirement savings in the United States.
According to the FT, the board of directors of AIG met Sunday night to review possible sales.
No confirmation could be obtained at AIG.
Assets that AIG would potentially separate from include its International Lease Financial Corp. aircraft lease branch, its 59% share of the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate assets and investments in private equity, the FT further explains.
No final decision has been made regarding these sales, the FT continues.
AIG must make the sales as quickly as possible to repay the loans over 85 billion that it has granted the federal reserve, also at the risk that the American authorities will receive 80% of their capital and current shareholders will be lost to the same extent.
Analysis Historical Paris of the meeting Historical morning meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historic fall in prices on Monday after the Chamber of Representatives rejected the Paulson plan to rescue the banks: The Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdag 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is down 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
As for the points, the strongest case in its history (684.81 points) was earlier on the 17th. September 2001, the day of the decline in trade after the terrorist attacks of 11. September.
According to the final firing figures, the Nasdag index, mainly technology, has fallen by 199.61 points to 1,983.73, and the widely used Standard&Poors 500 index fell by 8.81% (106.85 points) to 1,106.55 points.
After the unexpected rejection of the plan to rescue the banks by the Chamber of Deputies, which was again supposed to allow some stability in the markets, Wall Street collapsed, which was already battered at the beginning of the quarter.
With 228 votes against and 205 for it, the deputies denied the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the funds he had asked for.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
`A bad picture is being circulated here, which portrays Congress as incapable of adopting a plan," said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
`This shows how much the market counted on this plan,' she added, and fears that a project adopted in several days will come `too late'.
`If the project is indeed doomed (...), it will quickly be the task of the Fed (the American Central Bank, ed. Red.) and other central banks are to get a grip on the crisis, which would limit credit terms even more," warned Brian Bethune, economic chief at Global Insight.
And Miss Piegza emphasized, highlighting the feeling of utmost urgency even more, `that every day that passes, the ruin of a financial company' in the United States 'ends up'.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual on Friday, the American authorities planned to buy up the banking of Wachovia by its competitor Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis suddenly accelerated, leading to emergency measures in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux countries, Iceland and Germany, an indication that the markets are facing 'not just an American but a worldwide crisis', the FTN Financial analyst added.
The market for basic supplies has grown strongly.
The revenues of the state treasury within ten years fell Friday evening from 3.632% to 3.827%, and revenues within 30 years last night from 4.161% to 4.357%.
Morgan Stanley provides its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong case of its stock market price.
A week after a preliminary settlement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at the unified price of 25.25 dollars, which results in a total amount of three billion dollars.
The assumed price is below 19% of the share's price value as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in acquiring convertible stocks, which will secure it a 10% profit and can be sold again at a price of 31.25 dollars.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be made on the basis of a uniform average price of 29 dollars, i.e. 28% above the current price value.
However, Morgan Stanley shares fell 6.79% to 23.07 dollars at 17.00 GMT.
`This strategic connection represents an important opportunity to accelerate the transition from Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank," said John Mack, Director General of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, which is designed to allow it to expand its businesses to new areas, but under federal reserve supervision.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street's biggest names to adopt a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the settlement has been changed over the course of the last few days: Last Monday, Morgan had simply declared that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about 8.5 billion dollars.
`A week ago,' declared in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, managing director of MUFG, `we thought the stake would consist entirely of common stock.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and hedge. '
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will be done with a reduction in earnings of approximately 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in one year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares if the latter are exchanged within a given period at more than 50% above the sale value, i.e. approximately 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds supplied by MUFG will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen their balance sheet and increase their sales.
However, a press officer for the group refused to provide more precise information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After investing in MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to post a solvency ratio of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said his record had been `clearly' lowered since late August.
The last few weeks have been tough for the group, which has had to watch their stock market price decline by half, while the price of insurance against insolvency skyrocketed.
That price declined on Monday but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other `survivor' of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the purchase of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had withdrawn 15 billion dollars, in part at Berkshire Hathaway, the group of Warren Buffett.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
The Republic of the Socialism of 21. Re-founding century around.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Equatorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third person who, following the example of his like-minded people and friends, put the plan of a new constitution up for election this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results, which amounted to 80% of the electoral vote, 64% voted `yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted `no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were delivered empty.
In order for the constitutional project to be passed, one vote must be scored more than half of all votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exits of the polling stations and a count of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for `Yes', and predicted it 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The `constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly', he had assured in Guayaquil, the seat of the government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held in silence under the Observational Division of the Organization of the American States (OAS), referred to a 444-point text to secure the `new socialism' for which the president is campaigning.
The constitutional project transfers the state authority to the economy by leaving it with the sole right to `development planning' in a country that largely lives from the production of oil by foreign companies and from the foreign exchange that emigrants send to the country.
The project, which is being pushed by the 2006 elected Correa, also grants the head of state more comprehensive power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education, which the President has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
In the end, it also envisages banning the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the settlement between Quito and Washington to use an equatorian base as a starting point for American anti-drug deployments.
Obama, winner after points in first televised duel
The first debate of the two candidates for the White House on Friday was followed by another to find out who emerged as the winner, John McCain or Barack Obama.
As expected, the QGs to the election of both Republicans and Democrats announced their own victory in this televised duel, which should be followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen estimates that John McCain's performance, though quite handsome, was not `brilliant' enough to allow him to still stop his decline in the election polls five weeks before the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll was published on Saturday, according to which Obama is ahead with five points (49% to 44% for McCain), is of the opinion that the Democrat is clearly making the better figure.
Among the still undecided voters, so those who matter now, Obama emerged as the winner from the polls with 39%, while according to a CBS poll, 25% of them see McCain as the winner.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday with the good performance expected by his competitor Joseph Biden at first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin
“It would be a mistake to underestimate them.
She has good instincts," but warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
The seventy-year-old McCain did not cease to focus on his undeniable experience in the field of foreign policy, and in doing so clearly underlined his opponent's `naivety' regarding these questions, which formed the center of this first television duel.
`Senator Obama does not seem to understand that...', he emphasized several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge to become president,” he said.
A point of attack that has been preached in the Republican election commercials since yesterday.
Obama himself stressed that he represents the future.
He expressed himself briefly and precisely without being upset.
He brought his ability to the forefront of making good decisions and renewing the image the world has of the United States.
`McCain still hasn't understood, but Obama already,'" this weekend put a Democratic election commercial against it, in which Republicans were accused of not grasping the full extent of the crisis that weighs on the `American from the street'.
`During the 90 minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you,' Obama denounced yesterday in front of 20,000 people who had gathered in pouring rain on an election event in North Carolina.
He did not even mention the words `Mittelstand' or `Arbeiter'. The financial crisis gives Obama, whom Americans consider most suitable for saving the economy even on the edge of the abyss, a clear advantage.
`The coming week could be a decisive turning point,' said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer yesterday.
Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, a former Clinton administration member, compared Obama's `good economic instincts' to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current crisis is 'the closing judgement of an eight-year poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain'.
After stressing again that he would arguably even manage to cut taxes on 95% of Americans despite the fluctuations on Wall Street, the Illinois senator pointed out that the creation of a possible energy independence of the country and the promotion of renewable energy, along with the introduction of a health insurance system, were a top priority for him.
McCain, on the other hand, wanted to build a plant of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
The two candidates carefully dodged the questions, which is on the plan to save the financial market over 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros), which was passed by the Congress last night and is extremely unpopular with the people.
`Did you notice that an election was held in Minsk?'
Young people and opposition activists demonstrated Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday night since polling stations in Minsk's market square closed to protest the fraudulent nature of the parliamentary elections.
Although no result had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to demonstrate against the power of Alexander Lukachenko: `The dictator should resign'.
Some admit that they didn't even vote: `What good is this if they do what they want with my voice anyway,' says a teenager.
They do not believe that the regime, which has shown itself to the foreign observers in the best light to resume negotiations with the European Union, is ready to make a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including the failure to grant visas to 40 leading Belarusian figures and the impingement of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed clean by the observers.
According to the opposition, they were not.
`We were excluded from the electoral commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the count,' regretted Yuri Potemkin, press secretary of the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous association of twelve parties.
This is a cosmetic change, emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-Europe movement, because it is significant who counts the votes, and with us that is the executive.
If MPs of the opposition move into parliament, it is because they were appointed, and not elected.
But their entry into parliament can mean airtime on television, meetings in the regions and legislative proposals. '
So the opposition is guilty of getting involved in the political game, because `the dialogue with the European Union must be opened.
Because if our economy, which is heavily in debt to Russia, is in crisis and we do not reform ourselves, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
Well, we want to be independent.'
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has followed the election, does not recognize the election as valid.
She stresses that the turnout figures seem too high, and that the expansion of voting in advance (26% of Minsk voters) has paved the way for any kind of manipulation.
`Have you noticed that an election has taken place?," asks the leader of the social Democrats Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition in parliament, the ones who are most likely to meet the government's ideas. '
The silence of the night descends again over the Oktoberplatz.
On television, President Lukachenko and the members of the central election commission congratulate each other on their success.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad
An Egyptian command launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
You're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held in the desert for eleven days, were returned to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon in a healthy and unharmed manner.
In the morning, they had been freed by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Seemingly in good condition, the hostages reached the al-Maza military base right next to Cairo's international airport around 3:30 p.m. aboard a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreigners' district of Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy `best health' and the kidnappers `no ransom was paid', Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna explained on the tarmac.
After she on 19. September at an off-road safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya had been captured, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought from one hiding place by 35 unknown kidnappers from one hideout to the next.
It involves eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four chauffeurs, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official explained that 30 members of the special forces, from board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
`On both sides, shots were fired and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,' said this person in charge, who wishes to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of Italian diplomat Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is currently, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
`We must acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and from the special forces,' he explained without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The previous evening, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle in a patrol, which contained the kidnappers, six of whom killed, including the leader from Chad, and two arrested.
The army declared that they were connected to a rebel group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, but this movement immediately denied.
Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate about funding the culture is making headlines and is central topic of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pathetic sums granted to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations or the national historical places that starve miserably?
Which politician will dare remind the federal government that it neglects its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley?
Among our American neighbors, it is written in the constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all government districts, and in mutual coordination.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec’s Historical Societys, at least 40,000 volunteers gathered in 211 history societies are trying to deal intensively with history, with a few dimes to save the numerous private archives, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, who protest with the power of despair when patrons and decision-makers let go of their bulldozers in our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Conversation - From the blood that became safe again
Hema-Quebec celebrated the 10th yesterday. anniversary of its foundation, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, had every reason to rejoice, because Hema-Quebec has become one of the safest and most efficient blood banks in the world.
And above all, she has regained public confidence, which had been severely shaken by the scandal of contaminated blood in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, the national blood reserves managed by the blood donation service of the Canadian Red Cross were contaminated with the HIV virus and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In light of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada launched a public investigation led by Judge Horace Krever in February 1994, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to draft policies to prevent a renewed catastrophe of this kind.
While Judge Krever was still reluctant to hand over his report, at the time several provinces set up a committee whose goal was to develop a new system for managing blood preserves in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau committee fulfilled this mission.
According to the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two blood banks were established in Canada: Hema-Quebec, which is responsible for Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company to supply the other provinces and the two territories.
`1998, when Hema-Quebec started her work, barely 38% of people had confidence in the blood preserve system in Quebec, Dr. recalls. Décary.
The situation was daunting.
Through the enormous efforts to improve the safety of blood preserves and by working in this field during the following years, we have regained the public confidence," she says, before proudly stressing that by the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of Quebec's population now had confidence in Hema-Quebec.
Dr. Décary, however, keeps in the awareness that `trust is something extremely fragile'.
Since its inception on 28. September 1998, Hema-Quebec acts on the principle of caution.
At that time, we witnessed the occurrence of numerous cases of human form of mad cow disease in Europe, a new species of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, tells this woman, who has been in charge since its foundation in 1998.
And we had no idea if this disease could be transmitted through the blood.
So we invoked one of the main guidelines of the reports of Krever and Gélineau, according to which exclusion measures are applied if you do not know this and if a disease progresses only slowly, as is obviously the case with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which manifests itself through degeneration of the brain, which inevitably leads to death.
So in April 1999, no blood was taken from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
Well, a few years ago it was proven without any doubt that this disease is transmitted via the blood.
Thus, this event has shown us that the principle of caution that we applied makes sense.
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (NST), which make it possible to detect the occurrence of the virus itself directly in the blood of the donor, and not that of the antibodies against the virus, as was the case with the tests used so far.
The NST made it possible to shorten the incubation time that takes place between the time the person was infected and the one when the first viruses can be detected by our techniques in the blood, the specialist explains.
This time could be reduced to a duration of less than a week.
So the risk that certain donors might be infected without knowing it, and you could not recognize this, was significantly reduced.
These improvements made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of transmitting AIDS via a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving blood infected with HIV.
In other words, this means that you would have to distribute 12 million blood preserves before someone would be infected with HIV.
Since Hema-Quebec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood preserves each year, it would take more than 24 years before a case occurs in which HIV was transmitted via a blood preserve.
I believe that nowadays you can feel comfortable when you get a blood transfusion or prescribe it to restore health," says the head of the directorate of Hema-Quebec.
`Our challenge for the next ten years is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen can get into the system.
Just last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the Westnil virus, is transmitted through the blood by insects.
We have to monitor continuously," Dr. drives. Décary continued before stressing that in addition to secure care, Hema-Quebec must also provide adequate care.
“The demand is increasing because the population is aging.
Because cancer-fighting treatments are more aggressive, patients often need new red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the blood donor network, which on average only includes 3% of Quebec's blood donation-appropriate residents. '
Every healthy person who is 18 years of age or older and meets the aptitude criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who provide their blood are not accepted because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and those who have traveled to a country where malaria is spread is excluded from donating blood for a year.
`With these 3%, we manage to obtain an inventory that meets the needs of the hospitals.
Lack of supplies are very rare.
But you have to renew the members of this donor network as they get older and can no longer donate blood.
It's hard to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly, to keep them and get them to become regular donors.
Life is so hectic nowadays that you rarely find the time to spend an hour donating blood," Francine Décary regrets.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, Hema-Quebec not only supplies blood preserves, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is used almost exclusively in case of serious burn injuries.
These tissues are examined, processed and frozen before being temporarily stored at Hema-Quebec, which also manages Quebec's only public cord blood bank.
In the umbilical cord, which was formerly considered a biomedical waste, there is rich blood on stem cells, which can serve to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
`A few weeks ago we celebrated the storage of our thousandth umbilical cord blood sample, and we plan to take more than a thousand annually.
`We should probably start making it available for transplants early next year,' explains Dr. Décary continues, which describes this program of cord blood loss as very popular.
`Many mothers are convinced that they do not have access to it,' because Hema-Quebec lacks the means to offer this complex and costly program in all of Quebec's hospitals.
Soccer - Impact in the semi-finals
Montreal's impact yesterday, thanks to a 3 to 1 victory (4 to 3 with all goals) against the Sounders from Seattle in the second and decide the game of the quarter-final series at the Saputo Stadium, where the overall goal ratio counted, qualified for the semi-final round of the elimination games of the first league of the USL.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the ninetieth minute of play.
After a first half without a goal for both one side and the other, midfielders David Testo and Rocco Plancentino landed the other hits for the formation of Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one to stand in the way of Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that at the first game of the pre- and return series on Friday, Impact had brought the Starfire Complex in Tukwila in a suburb of Seattle a 2 to 1 defeat.
In the semi-finals, Impact will compete with the Vancouver whitecaps.
Saturday night Thunder equalized in the return leg in Minnesota a 3 to 1 deficit by a 4 to 3 victory, but the Whitecaps nevertheless moved into the semifinal round with an overall goal ratio of 5 to 4.
Impact will probably have to face the whitecaps Friday and Sunday, but the details of the game series will be determined today.
In short - Victory goal by Kovalev
The Canadian team's No.1 trio is ready to tackle the season.
Last night, the unit, formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn, pushed ahead with a storm fire on the attack on the Panthers from Florida, resulting in a 3 to 2 victory.
Kostitsyn, the star of the encounter, scored a goal, Plekanec delivered two assists and Kovalev converted a pass in that victory game, the fourth of the Tricolore in six pre-season games.
Kovalev scored the win by firing the only goal of the whole shooting.
I am not ready yet, the Russian warned.
I need another game to make me feel good. '
`He was too fixated on it in the first half, Guy Carbonneau noted.
But I think he liked the end of the game.
He received stormy applause. '
Charest is betting on the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out initiating elections before the end of the year.
As soon as the General Assembly of the Liberal Party was over, Jean Charest went to Jean-Talon in Quebec yesterday, where the new Health Minister Yves Bolduc (left) is trying to be elected in today's partial election.
`Delay the course of our last major border in the north': This is the long-term goal that Jean Charest presented yesterday with visual means at the General Assembly of the liberal party of Quebec in Levis, following the guidelines altogether.
During his lecture, a kind of picture mill was projected behind him.
On three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric power plants, mines, viewed from Quebec in `Google Maps', maps, etc.
Big resources like during the election season.
By the way, the Prime Minister refused to rule out that he will hold the elections this autumn, even if he announced that his schedule was very busy.
The `Plan North' is the fourth element of a `vision' that the Prime Minister supposedly has for Quebec, namely that of a `new economic area' that provides for an agreement with France regarding labour, an agreement between Canada and Europe and agreements with Ontario.
Although she has been frequently mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches in recent times, the opening of the North - the northern area on the 49th latitude - had never been the subject of a presentation.
However, the Prime Minister limited himself to explaining why the North was `a jewel with enormous potential' but did not name a date, investment sums or exact priorities for the upcoming projects.
At most, some outlook on what more could be worked on: especially on water energy, forest, but especially on the mining sector, favoured by the growth of emerging markets and the renewal of public infrastructures.
According to Mr. Charests, the North owns `nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium and even diamonds'.
This `area twice as large as France' `is near us, is in Quebec.
It's not just near us, it's in us,' he stressed, as to show clearly that he's trying to realize a national founding dream.
Quebec has grown a lot through its connection to the North, he emphasized: the road to gold in Abibibi, the technique of Quebec, the James Bay.
`It belongs to us, it's our future,' he added after taking a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the prime minister told the press.
`This is a traditional attitude that all governments pursued.
There is a boundary line on which there has been no agreement for a very long time, if the opportunity presents itself, I will take this position again in the name of the government," he explained.
Besides, `with climate change we need to rethink our vision of the north,' he explained, and talked about the Northwest Passage, which will be passable all year round due to the ice melt.
Against this new geopolitical background, the Prime Minister thinks that it is almost a duty to occupy this area.
And the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that Quebec's government would be very careful with them, and that they would benefit from this project, especially the young.
Two former ministers from various parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former pecist MP from Ungava) have already launched deliberations on about thirty communities.
A ministerial committee headed by Benoît Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (transport and mineral resources) occupies an important place, has begun the work.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a large assembly, `not necessarily a summit', but an opportunity where `one will create a common vision'.
Moreover, the development of the North will be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
the North plan will be `discussed, regulated and environmentally friendly', he promised.
Jean Charest described this `vision' as if it were a continuation of those of the liberal prime ministers who were in office before him.
`Like the liberals who were in office before us, we have rethought to turn the challenges into new growth and development schemes.
By the way, this was one of the weekend's themes that were raised again and again, which was held on Friday with a big cocktail party to celebrate the 50th. Anniversary of the takeover of the party leadership by Jean Lesage was opened.
One of the adopted decisions envisages renaming the Beauharnois power plant in Adélard-Godbout Dam.
`From Godbout, who created Hydro-Quebec, to Lesage, who has achieved the silent revolution and the nationalization of water electricity, to Bourassa, who made the James Bay, our party always knew how to determine the future,' Jean Charest explained.
He referred to the press to another, this time conservative project, namely the program `Roads to the North' by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
With regard to the Eastmain1a-Ruper Hydropower Dam project, Mr Charest emphasizes that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
`That remains among us, but I intend to be there,' he confided to his party members, which provoked those applause storms.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly 2009, has in fact not yet ruled out the possibility of holding an election this autumn, which is possible for him by law.
He stresses, however, that his schedule is full, mainly because of a Community Council mission in China and a summit between Quebec and New York.
The general assembly of the weekend gave the liberal party leader a platform of nationalist plans, especially from `the constitutional objectives', which were readily adopted: The PLQ calls in particular for the recognition of the `speciality of Quebec' in the constitution.
It also wishes Quebec to appoint members of the Council of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications and to have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the guidelines of the Nord Plan were received with skepticism.
The head of the Parti Québécois, Pauline Marois, has brought back the policy for the development of the North-du-Quebec, which the Landry government introduced in 2001.
According to her, when she came to power in 2003, the Liberal government refrained from applying it.
If she had done it, `we would have been much further today', Ms. Marois judged alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ has advocated supporting the adoption by the government of a Northern Plan.
`But what we want is that this is not just going to be a big idea,' explained party leader Sébastien Proulx on behalf of Mario Dumont, who is coming back from vacation today.
Letters - A dishonoured country
Mr. Vic Toews, ex-'Justice' minister (what irony) in the Harper cabinet, it was who allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour last summer that she was a 'disgrace' for Canada.
This woman, who has waged an endless struggle for justice and deserves all our admiration to cover with shame, says just as much about the people around the Prime Minister as about Stephen Parker himself.
We are dealing here with a government that is the only one from all the countries concerned that has not brought home its compatriot captured in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn't even take into account that Omar Khadr was still a youth when the things happened to him being accused of.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, breaks its word and lets a child soldier vegetate in inhumane conditions.
The only one who degrades to a judicial parody to assess the defendant's guilt.
Let us recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Association of Canadian Lawyers in particular are pleading to bring Omar Khadr home to get a fair trial in Canada.
It is precisely this government that is also closing its eyes to torture: it is little of their interest that a young adult, after so many years of torment, will surely be forever mentally broken.
We are not yet aware of this, but we are experiencing here precisely an insidious circumcision of our rights, our freedom and our `democracy', this word that Harper constantly carries like a flag in front of him, and which sounds so meaningless from his mouth.
So the time has come when there is no more morality: one may arbitrarily abuse, torture and imprison a Canadian citizen, at the discretion of a head of government who is still only supported by the minority (may he after the 14th. October is part of the minority...).
Many voters believe they find their salvation in a party that preaches virtue, law and order. But they don't see this government breaking away from what made up our country's reputation and dignity.
The shame, Mr Toews, lies in this saying, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - The Orwellian Speech by Barrick Gold
In her issue of 17. In September, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Deputy Director General of the Canadian Gold Mine Barrick Gold.
This confirms, and pursues an Orwellian logic that the world's largest gold-making company sought a slander lawsuit over six million against three authors and a small penniless publishing house, with the aim of opening a `public transparent debate'.
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, then they do not judge the truth, especially not in the case of slander lawsuits, but about the law.
As expected, this fundamental difference was completely concealed by Mr Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to have a public debate is to ruin anyone who dares to represent one of their opposite opinions.
No matter how the trial goes, the authors and the editor of the book Noir Canada will have to spend significant sums to prepare their defense and fight with very unequal weapons against an army of lawyers paid out of the almost inexhaustible pockets of the gold mine.
The tactics in these unequal battles, by the way, are often to ruin the defenders to force a consensual settlement that silences the opposite side and also deters anyone who dares to deal with the question again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, she would have had to present her view of things before public opinion.
In contrast, what is common in many of the countries where Barrick Gold works is usually debated in Canada by the exchange of ideas rather than by stick blows.
It would therefore have been enough if the Goldmine had disclosed its books and files and opened a real debate, through the newspapers, media, publications and the financing of independent audit teams that could have brought light to this question.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have confidence in public opinion and wipes aside the petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada with a hand movement.
Could perhaps Mr Garver explain how he can ask for a 'public' debate at the same time, and yet disregard the opinions of this very public?
Apparently, in the world of the Vice-President, this word encompasses only the generously paid lawyers, and not the community of all Canadians; a quite cramped view of the term.
In a democracy, even slanderers have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - is that the public, which supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it opposes the gold mine's brutal stance.
This public is willing to listen and judge Barrick, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, rather than in a framework that many perceive as a gag lawsuit (in the course of the `public debate', Barrick Gold has just made a demand to the authors of Noir Canada in which she requires them to stop using that term...).
Aside from Mr Garver's surreal speech, Barrick Gold's lawsuit is a direct attack on freedom to academic research and truth-telling, which is fundamental to any democratic society.
It completely denies the right to cite credible sources and to discuss facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible in a country like Canada to explore and discuss topics that do not please the rich companies of this world, who else can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have it by following the scientific norms used by the authors of Noir Canada.
She has a right to answer.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to get a grip on debates and discrepancies and to resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disproportionate lawsuit clearly shows that, contrary to what it dictates, it has no desire for a transparent debate.
This is a loss for the university world, as well as for public debate, and it is time for governments to take action that restricts this kind of unjustified lawsuit.
Wall Street bailout - Democrats and Republicans get along
The Bush administration and senior congressmen, Republicans and Democrats alike, finally came to an agreement yesterday on the most extensive economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the plan over 700 billion US dollars, which is supposed to stop the financial crisis, which has been rocking Wall Street for months, has yet to be adopted by the two chambers of Congress.
The main content is: better control of MPs over the practical application of the plan, new mechanisms to secure the repayment of the public funds used, new injunctions to curb the number of homes seized due to arrears, as well as the right to monitor the salaries paid to the officers of the supported companies.
American Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Deputies Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican Representative present at the negotiations, Senator Judd Gregg, announced yesterday, a few minutes after midnight, the good news, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
`We have made great progress towards an agreement that will be market effective,' said the Bush administration representative, Henry Paulson.
“It all happened to protect the real economy and the American people from the price crisis on Wall Street,” the Democrat explained.
“This is the fundamental point: if we don’t do that, the trauma, chaos, and riots in the daily lives of Americans will be enormous,” said Republican Judg Gregg.
The negotiations had accelerated during the last two hours, fearing the effect that a renewed failure would have had on the mood of investors.
The deadline that had been agreed was the market opening this morning.
The two American presidential candidates, who only took part in the negotiations late, were more likely to be proponents of the settlement, but without failing to voice their discontent that they must be met in this extreme way.
Democratic Senator Barrack Obama insisted on the addition of certain injunctions to reach agreement, especially those designed to allow owners to keep their homes and those concerned the salaries of senior executives of the companies rescued by the state.
`If one asks taxpayers to take extraordinary measures due to the irresponsibility of certain persons, that is not something to congratulate oneself on.
But these measures are necessary," he explained on the American television stations.
When asked on another station if he will vote for the proposed plan, his Republican opponent John McCain replied: `I'd like to know the details first, but I hope so.
`The guiding principles I have read [show] that this is a thing that we will all have to digest, and with which we will be able to move forward.
The option of doing nothing at all is simply not acceptable," he said.
The 700 billion dollar plan is designed to make the taxpayers' money
He comes 14 months after a crisis, triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble that initially led to the collapse of high-risk mortgage lending (subprime) before extending to further forms of more common bonds (PCAA), and eventually resulted in a freezing of financial strength and the ruin of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republican lawmakers who failed last week's first attempt to reach agreement.
Since the Democrats have accepted that certain `toxic' assets of the societies in distress should only be secured by the government and not bought, one believes to escape the impasse.
In order to round off the angles for everyone in Congress, one has also added an injunction that if the government should make losses with this program within five years, it could then raise new taxes in order to recover its capital used.
The new plan envisages paying an initial sum of 250 billion, to which another 100 billion may be added if the president sees it necessary.
The payment of another 350 billion must be passed by Congress in a renewed vote.
In exchange for his assistance, Washington will receive shares in the supported companies that earn him dividends in the event of profits, and which it can sell again if the storm has passed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to stop the attachment procedures relating to the apartments that are tied to the real estate loans affected by this plan, and also to set deadlines for repayment and severance payments paid to the officers of the companies concerned.
The developers of the plan would like the Chamber of Deputies to vote on him already today, and the Senate then on Wednesday.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given the green light.
In fact, more votes yesterday rose against this project, both from the Republicans and the Democrats.
`Quite obviously Washington doesn't understand us,' said Republican Scott Garett, a member of the chamber's financial commission, his constituents.
`Yeah, we have a big financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
But not the one that consists in asking the taxpayers to cash in.'
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, leader of a group in Congress called 'the Kaukus of the Skeptics,' presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
`Four hundred excellent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to share: we ask Congress not to be pressured, and to carefully consider which way to take,' he explained yesterday.
At the same time, we in Europe were once again proving that this was a global crisis.
At an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it would refrain from buying up its competitor, which is in great trouble since it lost 2 billion euros (US$2.9 billion) in the crisis caused by high-risk real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the twenty largest European banks and the ten largest insurers.
'This is not lost money, Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos declared yesterday.
To compensate, we receive a right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what the savers and households value, now that uncertain times are announcing themselves. '
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government was in the process of nationalizing another bank troubled by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over all ongoing loans to the bank Bradford and Bringley, of which over 41 billion (75.5 billion US dollars) from real estate loans.
Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy up the UK bank's branches and customer accounts.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank to nationalize the UK government since the start of this financial crisis, according to Northern Rock.
Paul Newman (19252008) - Death of a committed icon
His beauty with the azure eyes was his trump card for a long time, no one would say his weakness.
Had the American actor freed himself from the narcissistic mirror with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His sensitivity, his sensitivity and an obvious talent have probably also kept him away from a position of power that gives birth to the truly terrible monsters.
But what a great endurance runner!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83 from the aftermath of lung cancer at his ranch in Connecticut, remains one of the last icons of the American cinema of the golden years.
He was less monumental than Brando, to whom he resembled and for whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his acting, certainly also more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the blasting of dramaturgical conventions.
Mixed blood often yields wonderful children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, the son of a German Jew and a Hungarian-born mother.
From its European roots, one of the glorious faces of the American dream was to emerge.
Without excessive ego, extreme quality feature.
Because in it, an entire country that was in love with the self-made-man was reflected in the fighter who was injured in the Pacific War in the battle, who studied acting in Yale in the early 1950s and then attended the Actor's Studio in New York before he had success at the theater, on television and soon in the cinema.
It was precisely this man who fought for civil rights that was also the driver who finished second in the 24-hour race of Mans in 1979, and also a sex symbol, although he had been in a model relationship with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, the unknown facets of this mysterious, reserved, committed and hypersensitive to the glamour of show business also disappear, the puzzles of which will never be solved completely.
A decent man, in the purest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman put the cinema lovers in tumble this weekend, while on the dark screen of memories, all his great roles were played.
More than half a century of American film art in constant change is passing with it.
There again the charming cowboy from "Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid" (1969) pushes himself into memory, and the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the hot tin roof, which was filmed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
A much shorter memory (1990) is evoked, disturbed by his sensitive Mr. Bridge, who at his old age is disturbed by a wedding that did not fulfill all its promises.
There have been so many other Paul Newmans throughout history.
This criminal, stormy, violent and unforgettable boxer Rocky Graziano from Somebody Up There Likes Me (A Handful of Dirt) by Robert Wise, a role that was meant for James Dean, was resumed after his death and which Newman made known in 1956.
This sympathetic crook in the towering The Sting (Der Clou), which was awarded the Oscar for best film in 1973.
As a bitter and vengeful billiard player in the wonderful The Hustler by Robert Rossen (1961),
That face through the times, that was him.
Still him.
In his CV, epochs unite.
The youth know him mainly from the cult film Slap Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, the less orthodox coach of a hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the brothers Coen.
With a final role in 2003 as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Road to Perdition by Sam Mendes, the circle closed.
Unlike several cinema legends who have retired from the film world early enough, Newman should stay in the saddle for a long time, revealing Hollywood, his fortune, his pomp and his concessions.
The French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier saw him, not without humor, as a living challenge to the `underplaying' when he judged his overly expressive performances.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles flew for a long time only so.
However, he rarely played Sunnyboys as an outsider: neurotics, alcoholics, nastys or desperate, with whose perfect portrayal he reflected his slipping and rebellion.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown pages of his true sensitive sensitivity.
His Rachel, Rachel from 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence) with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a subtle portrait of women full of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott by an overdose, dedicated his film Harry and Son, a work full of sensitivity and sadness, to him in 1984.
At the tide of honors spilled over Newman yesterday, his close friend and former gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in The Sting and in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) declared extremely: `His presence has improved my life and this country.'
Generosity and joy of life were essential qualities of the late actor.
Apart from his legendary career, a great advocate of civil rights, environmental protection and independent cinema, an opponent of the drifting off Hollywood, is now also going there.
We have probably often seen him stand by foot in bowls full of vinaigrette, in sauces, pastries or other foods, and thought this to be quite tasteless, although we found it funny at first.
The profits from his sales nevertheless flowed into his foundation for children in need.
Instead of resting on his myth, Newman got involved until the shot.
He left his five daughters a letter with these sentences: `Always and until the very end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was an honor to be here. '
And for us, it was an honor to be able to pursue the life of such an intelligent and generous American actor.
An exemplary citizen, in the closest and broadest sense.
What was produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag &amp; Co.?
On 8. October begins negotiations in the criminal case against Jáno's contract and his accomplices.
In particular, the defendants are accused of involvement in organised crime, as well as grossly negligent damage and business fraud, and other criminal acts, including forgery of documents.
According to the public prosecutor's office, the funds lucrated from the tenders were used for their own purposes, while the services provided were often subject to fake invoices.
State funds and grants from the self-government - a total of HUF 65 million - are said to have partly flowed into the coffers of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, partly into the private coffers of individuals.
As the investigating authorities announced, fictitious invoices were submitted when receiving the tender funds, and the clubs are not said to have fulfilled their duties.
According to the indictment, much of the bills are said to have been forged.
The invoice blocks were bought on the market of Józsefváros, the round seals were made in Kiskunhalas.
The decision on which companies the invoices would be issued was decided on that round trip north of Lake Balaton to which István Lados was sent by János.
In the course of this "exploratory tour" Lados should locate pensions and restaurants.
He demanded bills on the consumption in order to be able to issue bills for the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the self-government of Budapest, based on these templates.
These bills are said to have been manipulated by the majority of István Lados and his accomplice, András Őri, the latter according to our information being responsible for the constitution of the relevant reports.
One of the destinations of Lados' "exploration tour" was a beer restaurant.
As two invoices issued by Zuschlag and Co in 2003 can be seen, the restaurant company is said to have hosted the ninety-member group of the association Biztos Pont Egyesület.
Now, however, the boss of the company states that such a large group would not have fit into the restaurant at once.
Another invoice, issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later known as Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért, also had serious form and content errors.
In a guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj, which has only three rooms and can accommodate no more than ten people at the same time, 130 guests are said to have stayed.
The imagination of the counterfeiters was apparently also unlimited when it came to the Pigal Kft., a restaurant, in whose accounting documents of the customers Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá do not even appear, according to the prosecution.
As Managing Director Győző Farkas told the hvg.hu, he was immediately aware that these were forged documents when documents were submitted to him by the public prosecutor's office during a questioning.
"Our company name and the tax number were incorrectly attached to the stamp."
And further: Apart from formal errors, the fact that the company is said to have accommodated one hundred people was also wrong, having a total of eleven rooms that could not possibly accommodate so many people.
Food was also mentioned on the bill, although the restaurant has not been in operation for a long time.
The busy counterfeiters have also failed to verify that the Budapest travel agency they targeted offers exclusively travel abroad, and so they have indicated Hungary trips on the cash bill, which also contradicted the company's accounting practice.
As was announced in the course of the investigation, they have also cited VAT on the invoices, although travel agency services relating to a country outside the EU are VAT-free.
The amount of VAT was incorrect in total on four invoices issued by the Hotel Révfülöp Kft. to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, since the company charges only 15 percent VAT instead of 25, and the employees issue only machine invoices, but the forged documents were handwritten.
Another mistake that the "invoice holders" had made was that they had indicated in one case "goods transport" as a service provided, although this is not offered by the company specializing in investment advice, the prosecutor's office said.
Other formal errors - incorrect invoice format, false stamp - were due to the fact that the one at Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, as well as to XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont could be exposed as counterfeit invoices.
Likewise, in the case of Ravenna Bt. and the Kunfehértó sports camp, whose managing directors claimed never to have issued the invoices.
Another "error" has been made by the counterfeiters at the HIB Kft. from Nyíregyháza: This company was in dissolution at the time (2001), when the group of the Fiatal Városért Egyesület is said to have eaten there - the mass administrator consequently stated that he had not issued the invoices himself.
Consciously fake
The other group of account managers are people who were well aware that they had to set fictitious invoices.
At the request of the Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták, the Esély Budapestért Alapítvány Foundation has issued invoices for the Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Foundation, amounting to approximately HUF 4 million.
According to the indictment, the managing director of Collab Kft. was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi, to issue the fictional bills.
The Biogate Kft., which is currently also in liquidation, is also said to have cooperated with the contract and the like: In 2003, the GmbH is said to have supplied the foundation Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, as well as the associations Atlasz Egyesület and Vörösfenyő Egyesület with counterfeit invoices with a total value of HUF 5 million, which referred to services not provided.
However, there was also no payment transaction, since the invoices were cancelled immediately after their issuance, which the persons concerned have forgotten to note in their documents.
The third group of accountants shall include persons who are directly associated with the defendants.
One of them is Iván Kubatov, the postman of the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft., a Budapest-based fuel and vehicle trading company that cannot be found there.
This company is said to have issued several invoices for the sale of computer components in the total value of HUF about 18 million in the period from October to December 2005.
According to the investigating authority, the since the 14. September 2005 Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which is in liquidation, has acted as buyers of these invoices.
The managing director of this company was a Romanian, to whom the company documents were also to be delivered by Iván Kubatov, between 2002 and 2005.
According to our information, Kubatov confessed during the investigation to have issued invoices on behalf of the GmbH to the associations Atlasz and Hoppá, as well as to Együtt a Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány and to have collected their equivalents themselves.
The companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and the Jos-Investment Bt. are said to have been founded by Romanian bricklayers at Iván Kubatov's express wish.
In truth, however, none of these companies were active, which according to the defendant was due to a lack of orders.
Nevertheless, he was able to benefit from the companies: At the request of his accomplice, the lawyer Zsolt Szente, who was commissioned with the preparation of the company's founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with the contract, such as Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
In total, Kubatov is said to have issued 15 invoices totaling HUF 14.2 million on behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade to the organizations.
The public prosecutor's office assumes that Kubatov could have collected 10% of the invoice amount and the VAT.
Kubatov is said to have even abused the company Szi-Beri Bt. for issuing fictitious invoices - in this case, the invoices were enclosed with the applications of Biztos Pont.
The company Y-Generáció and Szövetség a Modern Magyarországért submitted their applications in January 2006 to the non-profit organization of the Socialist Party, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány ("TMA").
Both received 500,000 forints each, but have used these amounts to be used in an alienated manner.
To cover this up, they have submitted five fictional invoices to the TMA of Works Team Kft.
By the way, these invoices were secured during the search of the office of Árpád Kemecsei in the Ministry of Education.
In the negotiations, some defendants are now expected to make a confession about the procedure of forgery of invoices, as they were already filed before the public prosecutor’s office.
A sensation could be if the main defendant Jáno's surcharge decides to make a comprehensive confession.
His previous information was less detailed, and although he had already promised several times to report comprehensively on everything, his confession is still pending.
The question therefore remains open whether this is in his interest, whether the Socialists have concluded a pact with him regarding the reparation of the majority of the damage suffered by HUF 50 million, and whether the surcharge is in return willing to take responsibility.
However, it is quite possible that the "insulted" will now be played by the "insulted" after his requests for mitigation of imprisonment and house arrest fell on deaf ears.
While other criminals who have caused far greater damage with economic offenses and have not remunerated them are at large, or at least under house arrest, the contract is denied this possibility.
The psychology of outbidding - or why we're willing to pay more
In the case of auctions, the buyers tend to spend more and thus overevaluate the file-off.
Neurologists and economic researchers at the University of New York have now succeeded in discovering the neurological-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to a study published in the "Science" magazine, people do not want to give themselves in a competition, such as an auction on eBay, and are therefore willing to pay even excessive prices.
The researchers have tried to explore the neurological scheme of this "game" with experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers was to play the lottery, while the other participated in a playful action - in both cases, the active brain regions of the subjects were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance (fMRI).
In both games, the participants were able to win money, but an increased activity of the striatum, a complex below the brain cortex, was measured in losers of the auction, in which the outbidding of the opponent plays an essential role.
Among many other functions, this brain region is responsible for the "self-reward" of the nervous system.
The researchers therefore said that the price increase could be explained by avoiding an overreaction of the striatum.
In order to support their thesis, the economists in the research group have additionally conducted investigations to track the money.
In this case, three groups should bid against a partner under different conditions.
The control group was told the true value of the product, after which they made their stakes.
Another group was also promised 15 dollars reward in case they emerge as winners from the game.
The third group received 15 dollars before the auction, which was also lost in the event of a lost game.
The difference between the two groups was therefore only that the emphasis on one was on winning, while the other was on losing.
As evidence of the hypothesis expressed by neurologists, however, the members of the group "against losing" were ready for higher stakes than those in the control or "profit" group.
"These results cannot be derived from any previous economic theory.
These have so far only justified the behaviors observed at auctions with the joy of winning or risk avoidance.
The contradiction between these two theories was resolved thanks to the imaging neurological procedures, so that we now have a third explanation ready," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Faculty of Economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When is the doctor to visit?
Around half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at a hundred thousand, but only seven thousand are treated, which is because the patients often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver diseases triggered by various viruses.
The symptoms are often similar - liver inflammation and jaundice are common, but the pathogens and diseases differ from each other.
Depending on the pathogen, the hepatitis viruses spread in two different ways: in hepatitis A and E, the digestive tract (for example, contaminated food or water), hepatitis B, C and D, the viruses can be transmitted through blood and other body fluids (such as sperm, vaginal secretions or saliva).
Travellers are recommended to be vaccinated against viruses A and B in any case, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A are apparent about two-three weeks after eating the contaminated food and are generally accompanied by malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that, jaundice occurs on the skin and in the eyes, the stool becomes light, the urine dark, and the recovery can last for up to two-three weeks.
Worldwide, about 1 million dies annually. People on the far more severe diseases triggered by hepatitis B, such as liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is in drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have serious consequences: untreated, it can lead to cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer.
Most infected people do not even know about their disease, because the pathogen insidiously destroys the liver cells - in many cases, the first symptoms show up after 20-30 years.
Therefore, timely prevention, such as regular check-ups, is essential.
There are three groups in which this disease is more common: those that underwent blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattooed people.
Currently, the number of chronic hepatitis C patients worldwide is estimated to be 200 million.
Since the disease is already detectable in a routine laboratory examination, it is advisable to consult the family doctor at the first signs of unknown origin.
Recognized in time, the disease is curable, the virus can be eradicated, thereby banishing the risk of infection and preventing the development of cancer.
The 30. September is the World Hepatitis Day, held for the first time in 2004 by patient representatives worldwide.
The aim of the action is to raise awareness of this chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses, their development and the importance of early detection.
Benelux governments nationalize parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to help the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which has become turmoil due to the US financial crisis: The three states provide the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands discussed at the highest level over the weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis, which has been going on for a year, so decisions that are now being made in connection with the bank could have a precedent.
In the spirit of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The bank will presumably sell part of its holdings, above all the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of the Fortis started a steep downturn last week, in the second half of the week serious crisis scenarios were already emerging.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a bankruptcy.
The institution's securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which is unrealistic according to the management.
According to management, the USD 700 billion expensive American bailout and the resulting uncertainty in the markets are to blame for the downturn in Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the bank's new director general.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but no interested party with a factual offer was found.
The Belgian government, meanwhile, was seeking reassurance - no investor is said to be shaking for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among customers so far, the bank's branches have not been stormed.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also owns leasing companies.
Are believers less in pain?
As recent research shows that religious faith acts as a kind of "painkiness" that is said to have already facilitated the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University have conducted an interesting experiment: it was investigated to what extent the belief in God affects the sense of pain of man, reported the British paper "Telegraph".
In the course of the rather bizarre investigation, 12 believers and atheists each received electric shocks while studying a painting of the Mother of God.
As the results showed, the faithful were able to eliminate the bulk of the pain.
Using a brain scan technology, it could even be proven that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brains that is responsible for pain regulation.
The study was the first in a research project in which, in addition to scientists, philosophers and theologians from various departments of the university participate.
During the experiment, a sparkling device was tied to the left hand, which gave the electric shocks.
Participants were asked to focus heavily on two paintings: First, a picture of the Mother of God, painted by Sassoferrato in the 17th. Century, and on the other hand Leonardo da Vinci's "Lady with the Ermine."
The researchers hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary among the faithful would provoke a kind of religious trance while choosing da Vinci's image because it was barely different from the other painting and perceived as soothing.
The subjects each spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, and during this time received a total of 20 electric shocks in four stages, while they were to look at either the religious or the other painting.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Mother of God, as if they were "cared for," and they felt "rest and peace."
While viewing the religious painting, they reported over 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in mind.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the experiment, said that similar effects could also be produced with other, strongly acting images in the atheists, one would only have to find the corresponding photo.
"We would have to find a picture that triggers very positive sensations, such as a mother or a father," the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change our personality, and do so in many cases," Wright said.
After these excellent results, only the question remains what effect a Madonna picture of Leonardo or another comparable painter would have on the pain regulation of the faithful.
Would the high-quality Virgin Mary achieve even better results?
You are what you share about yourself
On the occasion of her 10th birthday, Google can rightly claim: it can be found in people's pockets as well as above their heads in the sky: she knows where people have spent their holidays, which specialists they go to, and what moves them.
And that's still not enough, according to Eric Schmidt, one of Google's chief executives.
In the direction of skeptics, which are plagued by Orwellian horror visions, he lets align: These would just overlook the essentials of Web 2.0.
In a recent interview with the Financial Times, Schmidt said that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users and thus get closer to the company’s original goal, according to which it wants to “order all the information of this world.”
Schmidt explained that after ten years of world-changing work, Google is still only at the beginning of the collection of information.
Asked about the status quo in five years, Schmidt said: he wished that Google would be able to answer questions such as "What should I do tomorrow?" or "Which job really suits me?", but software programs are not yet able to do so, as they do not know enough about the users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search terms would be registered in the course of their Internet searches, as well as the IP addresses from which they were searched, and the pages visited.
For example, the "Personalized Search" introduced two years ago allows the visitor to store his own search history and later to resort to it, so that the hits can be generated much more precisely later, and the same logic is also based on the so-called "recommendations", with which the system recommends customized products and services based on the earlier preferences.
However, the users wonder what happens in the event of a data misuse - "If you look at what I do" - some are worried about the Google data monopoly.
In most cases, however, it is more the potential power represented by the company that has a fearful effect, and less the guilt or fear of punishment, the pursuit of freedom or the revolt against the power that encounters rejection among many Internet users.
However, it is a proven fact that the search terms are not only stored, but also passed on to third parties in the event of an emergency, and in these cases there is no protection for the personal rights of the Internet user.
A prime example of this was recently the crackdown on pedophilia in Brazil, in the course of which Google handed information to the Brazilian government, which was collected by the joint site called "Orkut" and also enabled identification of the paedophilias.
However, users concerned about personal rights were still able to breathe a sigh of relief in May, when Google successfully went to court against the FBI together with the civil rights organization EFF: according to this, Google cannot be forced in the future with no point in the Constitution to give out information to the FBI on secret request.
(However, the Federal Government has successfully obtained the publication of 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms with reference to the Youth Protection Act passed years ago, but it was retroactively deprived of the list of individual users, or their web and search term list to two months.)
Google’s image remains controversial: those who are reluctant to release their personal data because they fear the loss of their privacy and privacy through the use of Google services scourge the company with the controversial outrage.
Meanwhile, the American "geek culture," which is present in many countries and unites enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, sees the next generation of "cool entrepreneurs" in them, unlike Microsoft, which is the market leader thanks to Windows, even if both are fighting for the same goal.
One possible reason for this is that, unlike Microsoft, Google does not require identification codes to its users, and provides its services free of charge, so that an open, constantly updated source code and program package seem to be far more attractive, youthful and cooler than the official practices of the software giant.
On the other hand, the geeks see through the problematic relationship between personal rights and the Internet - a relationship that has become the focus of attention, especially in recent years, thanks to the term "Web 2.0".
The "Web 2.0" is about nothing more than collaboration, i.e. users deliberately leave traces and use the available communication channels, and even if the dimensions are individually different, the main thing remains the same, namely to show themselves publicly.
An average young person can manage his profile on several community portals at the same time - from Facebook to Xanga, can connect them by means of other services, such as Twitter, or music services such as last.fm, and can finally integrate all this into a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. In addition, they can run blogs that automatically represent the latest photo galleries that are tested on Flickr or Picasa.
And a number of other exemplary cases prove: When looking at the party photos of the past night, the girlfriend soon finds out with whom her unfaithful friend has enjoyed, or the employee is dismissed, because he in his blog only too honestly airs his anger about the company management - one thing is certain: The term "privacy" has now been completely reinterpreted.
Who leads an online life, is what he reveals of himself - so you could formulate the basic idea behind the behavior of today's youth.
And those who try to keep something secret, or even bypass the Google monopoly, can do so gladly - such as with Scroogle, a tool that accesses Google's search engine, but deliberately leaves no traces.
Quite a few people deliberately do not register on community pages so that they are not findable, but also the online applications of Google, such as word processing and graphic tools and RSS feeds, can be dealt with alternative versions that are not tied to huge server parks and therefore do not generate the best possible profile from the user.
Public opinion, however, waits spellbound for Google to show its true face.
With its current value of USD 156 billion, the company is even ahead of IBM (USD 140 billion), Intel (USD 124 billion) or Coca-Cola (USD 110 billion), the advertising space of AdWords/AdSense threatens the revenues of the advertising agencies, and the increasingly faster introduced services are not only causing Microsoft, but also other software developers headaches.
However, critical viewers also find the disturbing counter-poles: For example, the Group management has completely rejected a protest by the employees after the fees of the company's own kindergarten were doubled, and the management also said that the repeated catering of the employees was too expensive. But all this seems to be almost mild against the fact that Google even went to its knees in 2006 before the Chinese government and agreed with an agreement that all hits critical of the regime, or those that violate good taste, would be filtered out.
The Group’s internal regulation is that no new service is advertised in advance, but only when it is already available. Nevertheless, the events of the coming months and years could again circulate a lot vigorously: While some think, Google's book and magazine scans and magazines, respectively. Archiving project now assumes that the company would soon have to deal with the Supreme Court, so others are rather worried about the "Health" system, which allows the creation of a complete health profile based on findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google builds a genetic database already provides the substance to the next generation of sci-fi authors - such as "Scroogled," the famous novel by Cory Doctorow, in the best Orwellian manner, describes a future in which a human being becomes frighteningly approachable thanks to data obtained by Google.
Two teenagers help the double murderer of Ózd in the removal of traces
In connection with the double murder of Ózd, the police have now interrogated two youths who are suspected of having helped in the removal of the traces, the spokesman for the police commissioner Borsod said on Tuesday.
The young people were confessed, currently they are accused of aiding and abetting.
According to information from the MTI news agency, they are two girls who defend themselves on the loose.
Aid is threatened with a prison sentence of up to five years.
The suspect in the Ózd double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
The man is under urgent suspicion of deliberately murdering several people out of greed for money.
In the course of the investigation, it has emerged that the 23-year-old had owed a larger amount of money to a 53-year-old.
However, the suspect did not want to pay his debts, so he lured his creditor to a site in Ózd last Wednesday, where he murdered him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to the MTI, the man has planned the act of long hand - this is also proven by the fact that he committed the murders with a weapon hidden at the scene.
Together with experts, the police are now investigating the murder weapon and the circumstances of its use.
Warsaw Stock Exchange puts out purchase offer for Prague Stock Exchange
About 200 million The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered euros, or 5 billion Czech crowns, for the one hundred percent purchase of the share packages of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, reaffirmed the offer that the Poles had placed despite the fact that they were earlier excluded from the Czechs as possible owners of their stock market.
The reason for this is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is entirely owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which, however, wants to sell more than 60% of the papers in the coming months.
According to the Czech daily newspaper "E15", the offer of the Poles contains the highest purchase price ever offered for the Prague Stock Exchange.
As the newspaper reports, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse have so far put in place offers.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all the interested parties, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would probably be the worst new owner, and he also did not rule out that this could even lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion Crowns.
According to shareholders' agreements, 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance Investmentbank with a 25 percent stake, followed by Ceská Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
In their comments devoted to the ever-increasing international financial crisis, some leading European newspapers already spoke of the "second 11 on Tuesday September."
We owe the global financial catastrophe to the American president, for example, "La Repubblica" - the president was not even able to get his own party behind him for the bill, which should bring some relief into the frightening situation...
Instead of a "new Pearl Harbor," as billionaire investor Warren Buffett called it, it would be more appropriate, from a "second 11. September" to speak.
Parts of the press in Madrid are also pinpointing the scapegoat in Washington.
According to the El Mundo, the lack of political leadership is to blame for the fact that the global economy is now on the verge of collapse.
The American financial system is in danger of collapsing more and more, and the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, but now after the vote in Congress there is a danger that Washington has no political means to manage crises.
The world economy is hanging in the air, just at a time when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
One can no longer ignore the threat, says the Geneva "Tages-Anzeiger".
Although some countries could still provide bailouts to their swayed financial institutions, and the banks could save from bankruptcy with the money of the taxpayers.
However, if a domino effect is triggered and even more banks go bust, then neither further financial injections nor other immediate measures help.
In the long term, EU member states would have to jump over their shadows and centralise control of the money markets.
On Monday alone, more than EUR 100 billion was paid to weakening financial institutions, recalls the Vienna "Der Standard". In addition, the newspaper continued, the concerns are increasingly realistic that after the Americans, the European taxpayers would now also have to reach a little deeper into their pockets in order to get out of the crisis.
So far, the EU has not seriously dealt with the crisis, which is now sweeping over the old continents like a tsunami.
The "saviors" would not have to "wag" immediately with several hundred billion euros, but it would be advisable to record in which case it would be reasonable to touch the taxpayers' money in order to avert even greater damage.
Intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best way to develop new accident prevention technologies if not to imitate the obstacle sensors from nature?
For example, those of the bees.
At CEATEC in Japan, an amazing project was presented in which the Nissan engineers were inspired by bumblebees in the creation of new accident-avoiding systems.
In collaboration with Tokyo University, Nissan has built the BR23C biomimetic system controlled by car robots, a mini-car equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the aim of supporting the development of a system that avoids any collisions.
In flight, each bee forms its own, oval "private area," which is very similar to our own "protective shield," Kazuhhiro Doi, product manager for technology PR and research development, said at the exhibition.
The composite eye of the bee, which can see in any direction and at an angle of over 300 degrees, plays an important role in this.
To mimic the function of the composite eye, the researchers took up the idea of the laser-controlled spacer.
This identifies obstacles before the BR23C in a field of view of 180 degrees within 2 meters, calculates their distances and sends signals to the microprocessor on board, which immediately initiates the collision-avoiding process.
The obstacle is registered in fractions of a second, and the car robot immediately changes course, similar to the movement of the bees, by turning the tires around the appropriate angle.
In contrast to previous systems, this maneuver takes place purely instinctively.
"If it weren't, the car robot could not react quickly enough to dodge the obstacles," explained Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the car robot project.
The system must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the innermost and most vulnerable part of the shield - a layer within which accidents are currently still considered unavoidable.
The whole process must reflect the behavior of bees when dodging other bees.
And that has to go in a split second.
However, unlike the bees, the dodging cannot be up, down, or even diagonally - it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction of the muzzle of the tires.
While the bees have endless possibilities to avoid other bees, the researchers were only able to use the rotational movement, or the acceleration and braking in the car robot.
The BR23C contains lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and more energy efficient, and therefore have a longer lifespan than conventional lithium-ion batteries.
Andoh explained that it depends on the instinctive, intelligent response, and less on the processing of the data, and even less on the ability to store it.
This device only has to process a few inputs per second and react to them accordingly.
It does not have to store these, or produce an intuitive, logical reaction on the basis of previous maneuvers, so that it only takes up a handful of KB memory on an ongoing basis.
It doesn't require gigabyte- and megabyte-heavy memories.
This is the first step in the development of the immediate collision avoidance technology, which Nissan estimates will be in production as standard within the next ten years.
Another application could find the technology in GPS satellite navigation by deliberately steering the driver around obstacles and thus guiding him to his destination.
A name for the sinful child
Now the written version of the 700 billion dollar bailout law is available, which will be applied in several stages and aims to buy the bad loans of the banks.
In the first round, half of the money is to be spent.
In a session that came to an end on Saturday after midnight local time East Coast, congressmen have cracked down on an agreement on the 700 billion dollar bailout after several days of debates, Reuters reported.
"We have made substantial progress," said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president in the American House of Representatives, saying that the agreement must only be put on paper.
The compromise reached on the bailout was supported by both presidential candidates - Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the programme will have an effect and it will be efficient, but more will have to be done. According to Pelosi, this is not about saving Wall Street, but about taking the helm of the economy.
The written version of the package was published even before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e., Washington time Sunday evening 8 a.m. (Central European time Monday 2 a.m.), but has not triggered a high on the stock exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill to stabilize the 2008 economy, then it will be the Senate's turn.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the White House also welcomed the news of the settlement.
We are pleased with the progress made on the night and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our markets and protect our economy, said Tony Fratto, White House spokesman.
However, the program differs from the original recommendation of the Bush administration, according to which the 700 billion. Dollars at once for the purchase of lazy securities burdened with loans should be issued.
In a first instalment, a maximum of half of the 700 billion amount is to be spent, with 250 billion immediately available after Congress is expected to vote on the case on Monday. This sum is to be spent on the purchase of borrowed, bad securities, and over the further 100 billion. USD is to be decided by the president.
The programme is reviewed by a commission of its own, which is also a member of the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the 700 billion depends on another congressional decision.
For the purposes of the law, the Treasury can also use a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, mortgages, and mortgage-burdened securities, or other “toxic” loans.
As competent persons of the Ministry reported, the purchase can be made both in an auction and directly.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program in which the Ministry of Finance guarantees the worrying funds, and the companies pay the expected damages.
Henry Paulsen said: The law defines the necessary funds in such a way that up to 700 billion Dollars can be made available as emergency aid to the American financial system, whether for the large-scale purchase of bad funds, their insurance, or the avoidance of a systemic risk triggered by the collapse of a larger financial institution.
We are taking the necessary steps so that we are ready to introduce the law once it has been signed, according to Paulson.
However, the heads of the banks, which have been in trouble and now rely on state aid, can expect that their clearances, which are called "Golden Handshake" in the overseas slang, will be cut by the government.
A cut in salaries will only be in certain cases, and these cuts will depend on how the Treasury Department helps out in each case.
The cut essentially means that when the ministry buys in the context of an auction, so the "Golden Handshake" is taxed, unless the disused bank boss is deported to the pension.
In the event of a direct purchase of the lazy loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that manager salaries are not exaggerated.
The picture also includes that the existing Golden Handshake contracts will not be changed - the restrictions only relate to new agreements so that all the more people participate in the program.
That's the first case in American history that cuts in manager salaries are regulated by law, Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the finance committee, commented on the measure.
The state gains participation rights in the participating banks, so that the risk for the taxpayers decreases, as they can also participate as soon as the economy and thus the rescued bank is better.
The bill envisages the president having to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how taxpayers should get their lost money back from the financial sector.
However, there were skeptics on both sides who expressed their doubts about the plan.
That's not what American citizens expect from us, the plan doesn't protect taxpayers' money by any means, according to California Republican Darrell Issa.
His colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said: The measures were pushed by the same people who are also responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise
Like the Central Statistics Office, domestic sales prices rose 0.1 percent in August 2008 compared with the previous month, and compared with August 2007, equal to 12.9 percent.
Export prices were 1.1 percent higher than those in July 2008, and are down 3.9% from previous year's prices.
Due to the domestic price changes and the export sector, production prices were 0.7% higher than in the previous month, and 3.2 percent higher than in 2007.
Domestic sales prices are only slightly higher than the previous month, i.e. up 0.1 percent.
Also, manufacturing industry selling prices have risen only slightly - 0.1 percent - since July.
The biggest price increase in August 2008 was for leather goods (2.8 percent) - primarily for bags and belts - here the increase was 4.6 percent, with shoes prices up by 2.5 percent.
Higher prices for plastics and chemical raw materials drove up prices for chemicals and productions considerably (1.6 percent).
A decline in prices was recorded in crude oil processing (1.4 percent), for electrical and technical equipment (0.9 percent), and slightly in wood processing (0.1 percent).
The prices in paper production, as well as among publishers and in the printing industry remained unchanged.
In other branches of the manufacturing industry, a price increase of between 0.2 and 0.9 percent was measured.
In the important domestic sales markets of industry, such as electricity, gas, steam and water supply, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, primarily as a result of the one on the 1. July introduced price increase on gas.
Looking at the domestic sales markets of the manufacturing industry year-on-year, prices in crude oil processing have risen the most (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, a 13.2 percent increase was observed, while the increase in food, beverage manufacturing, and tobacco was 11 percent.
A fall in prices was observed in the textile industry (2.5 percent) and for electrical and technical equipment (0.3 percent).
The extent of inflation in the other manufacturing industries was between 0.6 and 9.1 percent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing industry climbed by 10.2 percent last year.
Prices for electricity, gas, steam and water rose by 18.7 percent year-on-year.
In the domestic sales market, the highest price increase was recorded in the asset sector in August (0.7 percent).
In the manufacturing sectors for consumer goods, prices were up 0.3 percent, while in the energy and processing sector they remained the same compared with the previous month.
The largest increase in prices in August 2008 was observed in the energy and re-use sector compared to the comparable period of 2007 (16.8 percent).
In the consumer goods-producing sectors, a price increase of 6.8 percent was recorded, in the case of the fixed assets a price reduction of 1.4 percent.
Industry export prices measured in Forint rose 1.1 percent in August from the previous month, but there was a year-on-year decline of 3.9 percent.
The domestic currency became 1.7 percent weaker compared to the euro, 7.1 percent to the dollar, and compared to the price of August 2007, it grew by 7.5 percent compared to the euro, and even by 15.9 percent for the dollar.
No more visas to the US from 2009?
Kinga Göncz sees good chances for the U.S.-Hongarian visa agreement to be reached around 12. January will come into force, as the Foreign Minister explained to the representatives of the Hungarian community in Chicago.
In their view, "now everything depends only on whether the electronic immigration or control system is introduced overseas in time."
However, she also stressed that there will be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register in advance.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding negotiations in Washington from today.
She meets Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, to whom she will hand over the "Middle Cross of Merit with Star" of the Republic of Hungary, and she also holds talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democrat Barack Obama and Republican presidential candidate John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain support bailout for banks
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two presidential candidates of the major American parties, have their support for the 700 billion on Sunday. Dollar-heavy bailout pledged for banks. However, there are also politicians who demand the resignation of the finance minister.
The Congress and representatives of the government have announced after days of marathon discussions on Sunday morning that they have come to an agreement on the banking rescue package.
The Wall Street crisis, as well as the thawing of the frozen credit market, became the central issues of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain - both claim to be better suited than the respective opponent to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to recent polls, Obama has been able to further expand his lead thanks to economic issues, while McCain's high, which gave him the presentation of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin after the Republican Convention, has also melted away.
At a campaign event in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed his hopes that Congress would pass the law on the 700 billion. Dollar heavy package will quickly accept.
He emphasized that the plan also includes those passages of consumer protection that he has supported.
"We must act now, and responsibly (...) - Your jobs, your savings, entire industries, and the stability of the entire economy are threatened," he said in front of 35,000 spectators.
He has not failed to call McCain's economic visions "obsolete."
In an interview given to ABC, McCain said, “We will all have a hard time pinching on this (...) but doing nothing is certainly not an alternative.”
The Republican senator said the plan also mandates the establishment of a control commission for the Treasury secretary, as well as the restriction of clearances for top executives - something he insisted on.
Obama told the CBS that McCain had not played a definitive role in the negotiations, whereas he, Obama, was in contact with the minister.
On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that the House of Representatives will probably vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters became more confident within the camp - so commented "Der Spiegel" the weak performance of the CSU in Bavaria.
In Austria, Haider and Co are ready to govern to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the online edition of the left-leaning German news magazine, Franz Walter analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article "Bavaria's Revolution destroys their fathers".
According to the renowned political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
The Christian Socials have renewed Bavaria for decades - now the modern citizens in particular are turning away from them.
The break of the epoch is at the same time a problem of Christian democracy, as well as for Angela Merkel.
The disaster of the CSU did not come as a surprise, but on Sunday something came to an end, which, however, was already apparent almost exactly ten years ago: the undoubted hegemony of a state party
Ten years ago, in 1998, the CSU landed at 47.7 percent, falling below the fifty percent mark for the first time since the 1950s
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 federal elections, i.e. still in the much-quoted Stoiber era.
The modernization, which is consistently operated by the CSU in the federal state, has finally destroyed its own mothers and fathers.
Sociologists had already predicted this 40 years ago, but had miscalculated considerably at the same time. But without any impact, secularization, educational success, the inflow of East and North Germans into the prosperous regions of Bavaria could not remain the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is always accompanied by option proliferation. And that has political consequences.
The right-wing camp is intact - only the voters within the camp became more critical and idiosyncratic.
It is striking that in recent weeks, the classic civic groups have expressed the greatest distance to the CSU: the liberal professions, the commercial bourgeoisie and voters with a high school diploma such as university degrees.
Here, the support of the CSU dropped to even below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Vienna daily reports in its "Who with whom? Party leaders cautious on coalition issues" titled article about the chaotic domestic political situation in Austria after the new elections.
The SPÖ wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits the intervention of the SPÖ in internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to talks in all directions, while the Greens do not want to commit to a coalition yet.
The new elections are over, and now it's all about the coalition; in the debates on public television, the party leaders barely let it look into their cards.
SPÖ leader Werner Faymann reaffirmed his wish to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is very possible - in some federal states and in the social partnership this is already the case.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current ÖVP leader as vice-chancellor, left Faymann open.
As he said, voters would have voted out the bowl-molterer course.
A repetition of this direction would be out of the question.
Molterer, meanwhile, has reacted cautiously to red offers.
The cooperation could not be fruitful, he said, if Faymann tries to interfere in internal concerns of the ÖVP.
Whether his party goes into opposition or into the coalition is currently completely open, and these questions should be discussed internally.
BZÖ CEO Jörg Haider was open in all directions.
"In order to prevent red-black, we are ready to assume government responsibility," Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
Today in Paris, the European Summit on Equal Opportunities has begun, which this year is hosted by the EU Presidency country France.
In her speech addressed to the House, Lívia Járóka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party, drew particular attention to the segregation for education, as it is one of the most serious violations of the law that strikes Roma children, and this is also the biggest obstacle to their need for validity.
The high-level conference was opened by French Employment and Social Affairs Minister Xavier Bertrand on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimir Spidla, EU Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Among the participants were representatives of governments, the European social partners, as well as the most important European legal protection and citizen organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
As the press office of the members of the Fidesz EP reports, Járóka has pointed out that in addition to discrimination in the job search, the Roma would be displaced from the labour market primarily because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of Roma youth have no middle school education, and thanks to poor primary education, only a small proportion of them can achieve a university degree."
Furthermore, Járóka emphasized that education is a fundamental human right, which would play a key role in the assertion of other human rights.
Investments in the early education of Roma children can strengthen the economy of the EU member states.
According to the Members, it is important that these relationships become aware of the widest possible circle - that is, Roma and non-Roma.
Because the earlier a Roma student starts school, the more his chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market increase; and through income and sales tax, they contribute to national expenditure.
"As a citizen of the Union, the Roma must be secured the right to high-quality education - the poor and segregated teaching must be stopped," said Lívia Járóka.
As the MEP explained, a common, goal- and action-oriented approach by the European Union is necessary in order to accelerate the desegregation process in the education sector. This is essential to ensure that existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are complied with.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation, and unemployment and give Roma children the democratic opportunities to contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens," Járóka urged.
Since the Congress in Berlin last year, the summit has been held annually with the aim of creating a unique forum for the advance of the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European but also national level, in the sense of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities".
Fox in the chicken coop
Because of a person’s medication use, life and health insurance companies often refuse to sign a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are privacy programs that couple the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we entrust the fox to the chickens," the Washington Post quotes Richard Dick, developer of the prescription data tracking program.
Insurance companies determine the fees and the withdrawal amounts in the event of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and should the risk be assessed too high, the insurance is not taken out in the first place.
In the past, the customer was sent to a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in the knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: Based on the customer’s identification number, he obtains the data of the last year and a half from the pharmacies, i.e. which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and what his health status is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be concluded that his blood fat level is untreatable, which would automatically rank him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do the paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as migraines and hot flashes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the above-mentioned are not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do so by law, although omissions have not yet been punished.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory examinations and link them to the data on drug use. This provides an even more accurate picture of the patient’s health.
More and more companies are having access to the data, and the control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect only extends to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program, so that the data can only be passed on with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are quite somehow left to the fox's grace.
CSU: Grace on time
At the end of October, the fate of the fallen duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided
Despite the election debacle, no heads are rolling for the time being, at the head of the Bavarian CSU, the personnel debates have been postponed.
Party leader Erwin Huber and Prime Minister Beckstein still remain in their offices, the question is only how long this grace lasts.
The fate of the tandem after the catastrophic 17 percent loss of votes will be decided on the last weekend of October at the extraordinary party congress.
The much-scolded duo, however, already made it clear that it does not want to stick on their armchairs.
In doing so, they want to appease the disgrunted faction and the party base, which demanded personal consequences a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" in the face of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - admittedly, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, standing at his career peak - the Christian-Social Union still reached 60.7 percent. Now, however, a year after the coup against Stoiber, they were only able to secure 43.4 percent of the vote.
The CSU was "sole-governing" in Bavaria for 46 years, which generates 18 percent of Germany's GDP.
Although the conservatives remain the determining force in the southern state, which is also important for the Hungarian economy, will have to govern in a coalition in the future.
As a first sign of the internal restructuring of the party, the potential successor of Huber, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer will also be involved in the research team, which is holding exploratory talks with the liberal FDP or the right-wing "Free Voters" about a possible Munich coalition.
An irony of fate is the case that with the "Free Voters" list, Gabriele Pauli enters the Legislature, whose anti-Stoiber appearance the Huber-Beckstein Duo first exploited, and then the single-minded politician mercilessly dumped.
The CSU leadership is now focusing all its forces on stabilizing Beckstein.
In this transition process, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings from the background, will play an active role. The former prime minister and CSU chairman named the 28th September the "most bitter day of his political career."
On Monday, Huber made a few poisonous remarks toward the CDU - in his view, the CSU would have earned far more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a signal to the CDU and thus also to Angela Merkel.
Should the CSU, which also contributed a lot to success at the national level in 2005, not be put back on its feet with a joint act of strength, Merkel cannot become chancellor again after the federal elections in September 2009.
Merkel, who has made no secret of her disappointment with the fiasco, believes that the CSU's land loss will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is relative, however, is that the wounded CSU will not be easier to govern, and the crisis of the Social Democrats, however, continues.
With 18.6 percent, the SPD achieved its best result so far in Bavaria since 1946.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
In Sunday's elections, no opposition MP made it to the Ukrainian parliament.
Russian observers believe that this is due to prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but the OECD suspects illegalities in the counting of votes.
The OECD, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the elections.
The legislature of the 10-million-inhabitant state has been without opposition for decades. Nevertheless, the opposing party, which was saled together under the name "United Democratic Forces" (ODS), has seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who renewed his presidential mandate for the fourth time in the unclean elections and thanks to a constitutional amendment in 2006, would this time "allow" some members of the opposition in parliament.
That's why the ODS has even refrained from the previously planned boycotts.
Thanks to the rising prices in the natural gas import of Russia, Ukraine is becoming more and more economically dependent. For the relief of the price increases, even loans were taken out, and the country has also agreed to the sale of the Beltransgas, the owner of the gas pipeline leading through the land, to the Russians. So in the background of the opposition's expectations, there was the hope that Ukraine would improve its relationship with the EU after Lukashenko and other senior politicians have a ban on entry because of the anti-democratic political system in the EU.
The evaluation report of the OECD elections provided a temporary relaxation, in which the emphasis was on the positive movements rather than on the shortcomings - such as the exclusion of a third of the opposition candidates from the elections.
However, the OECD's rapid report on Monday criticized the campaign - so opposition activists should not appear in the press - and in particular the fact that the opposition was not allowed to be present in the counting of the votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is able to recognize an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been set free, for example, and Minsk is even ready for minor confrontations with Moscow by continuing to deny the recognition of the independence of the breakaway Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, although Russia, with which Ukraine forms a federal state on paper, has considered the two territories to be independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one backwards, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Alexander Milinkevich told our paper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, a continuation is desirable, although "the powerful have been afraid to let even one opposition figure into parliament."
The opposition is not planning any protest measures in the face of the results, but is more likely to try to make clear to voters of the need for economic reform.
"We are struggling with many problems here - the opposition newspapers have to be printed in Russia, the local authorities put stones in our way when it comes to distribution, but yet I see that more and more people are supporting change, even the elderly," said Milinkevich, in reference to the fact that not even the most supported class of pensioners agrees with the Lukashenko regime, whose only merit is the establishment of social security.
"Thanks to the indebtedness of the country and the rise in the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the "social security" to the silence of a cemetery begins to crumble," according to Milinkevich.
Unlike the opposition politician, Russian observers have called the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Ria Novosti news agency: "People believe the deeds, and not the words." The absence of the opposition is therefore proof of the maturity of the Belarusian voters.
Global meal plan from Marseille
European Union and India double trade
After the European Union and India are each other's leading trading partners on both sides, this was the main issue alongside other global problems at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-Indian Summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is an emerging, democratic great power that should be given more votes and say in international concerns, the member states have not yet been able to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi's permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at yesterday's ninth summit in Marseille.
French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and chief diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement has been reached to double trade in the next five years, i.e. to a good 100 billion. Euro to be increased.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 had increased from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil flight agreements with India have also been legally combined into an agreement, so that in the future air traffic will also be buoyed.
India would like to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: While the Union is the number one partner of India, New Delhi is only ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides condemned in the strongest possible terms. The convening of a UN conference was also urged.
The Doha Round should also be completed, with both sides to blame for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, that is, pollutant emissions are to be cut by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the proposal to reach a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The price increase in food should also be combated, so both support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped for orders to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to agency reports, the agreement is to be decided on for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the International Frankfurt Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be at the 60. Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights, to be present.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair expects more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread out over the fair's 171,790 square metres and introduce over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
Maria Giro, the Sub-Secretary for the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities, will represent the Italian government in the exhibition hall during the opening ceremony: Italy will be represented in the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room Structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, digits, trends and perspectives around publishing in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, but especially in the adult and youth sectors.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast is served before work"
For the first time in the history of Palazzo Chigi, there are rotatable doors for the entrances and exits of the officials.
From today, the measure against those smart people who first stamp and then go drinking coffee during working hours will come into force.
The new "Anti-Daulfur Act" was presented today by Renato Brunetta, the Minister of Public Administration and by Mauro Masi, Secretary General of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
"> "Rotatable doors are a means of increasing work efficiency through a higher attendance rate and more services," said Minister Brunetta.
"Now begins a new era of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism," Brunetta insists once again.
The Palazzo Chigi ends the establishment in all the buildings of the Bureau of the Council of Ministers.
Masi says: "The choice of rotatable doors is also of great symbolic value".
There was no resistance from the officials, the secretary-general assured: "This process was supported by everyone, the cooperation came from all sides".
All in all, there is no more breakfast during working hours; end with coffee or croissant .
Brunettas advises with a smile: "A good cappuccino at 7 o'clock works wonders".
During a meeting of the Upper Committee of Public Administration (Scuola Superiore della Pubblica Amministrazione)
from Rome, the Minister announces that "within three months, the absences of civil servants have been reduced to 50%, i.e. 60,000 more people per year are present at work."
He adds that it is necessary to strengthen the efficiency of Italy's public administration
"their wage dynamics - according to the minister - have been twice as large as the private sector and far above the rate of inflation in the last 8-10 years."
Meanwhile, thousands of officials have teamed up to counter the Brunetta decree as part of the Codacon-backed appeal.
"While the Minister of Civil Service is profiling himself with figures on lower absences at work - so the consumer center writes - the people of the 'active lazy' are growing continuously.
In fact, thousands of correct and valuable civil servants have come together to declare war on the unlawful norms of the decree.
In particular, the Regional Administrative Court (TAR) is facing additional financial compensation for work-related illness; thus, the planned extension of the sick worker's mandatory house arrest, during which inspection visits can be made, and other aspects of the Minister's innovations are also contested.
Napolitano: "Prevention of workplace accidents is crucial"
Every day, 2500 accidents at work occur in Italy, three people die and 27 remain disabled for life.
For the year 2007, the data of the Inail (Istituto nazionale contro gli infortuni sul lavoro) confirm that the fatal accidents at work were around 1200.
These digits prove the seriousness of a phenomenon that causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
Today, the Anmil (Associazione Nazionale Mutilati e Invalidi del Lavoro) will celebrate the 58th national day in all Italy's provinces for the victims of work accidents, thus drawing the attention of social institutions and media to this dramatic situation.
"The worrying data circulated by Anmil and the tragic news of these days confirm how crucial the issue of workplace prevention is," confirmed the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano in his message to the President of the Amil (Associazione nazionale mutilati ed invalidi del lavoro) Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his "great appreciation for the constant commitment to prevention in workplaces, to the protection of injured workers, to aid for the families of the victims and to raise public awareness."
"An outraged "basta" has risen to this; understandable in the case of tragedies, which, measured by their magnitude, trigger some swirls in the media and sympathy of the public. But everyday reality often confronts us with dramatic events that can even repeat itself in its own dynamics.”
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is definitely also a resource problem: it must be decisively invested in education and information."
The numerous initiatives are of particular importance for a more direct awareness of school frameworks on the part of young people who feed on the world of work.
It is our duty to focus attention on this phenomenon and not to distract from its social seriousness. You have to put a legislative standard into effect and improve.
For his part, the President of the Chamber has emphasized Gianfranco Fini "how the phenomenon of work-related deaths is an urgent social emergency, which insults the conscience of all of us and forces all institutions to work towards decisive rules that aim to put an end to the problem."
"The data of the workplace accidents seem to signal a slight improvement, but this does not rule out that the number of work-related deaths is far too high," emphasizes President of the Anmil, Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this "positive tendency" to mean less attention. That's what causes the tragedy in the end."
"As you think, you basically do too little to counter the phenomenon of accidents. You can fight against it through various actions.
In our opinion, stronger checks and inspections are necessary – according to Mercandelli; but also stronger measures to educate the workers who are already starting in school.”
"A further effort is necessary - so he adds - in terms of communication and raising public awareness.
But above all, a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers is in demand towards a phenomenon that is a social emergency."
Mercandelli also spoke of "the progressive deterioration of the protection for the occupational accident victims" and denounced the "abolition of the welfare system, which we have been fighting against in recent years."
"The aim is therefore to give the worker a guarantee of insurance so that the fate of the victim of an accident at work does not become dependent on voluntary or accidental donations, which are decided by a legislator from time to time."
Mp3 player under indictment: danger of hearing damage
Loud music over a longer period of time with portable music devices, such as e.g. B. Mp3 player, to be heard, can lead to permanent hearing damage.
This is reported by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the EU in a report published today in Brussels on the opinion of the EU (Scientific Committee on the current and recently identified health risks).
“The report, according to a note, makes it clear that 5-10% of those who listen to loud music with portable music devices for at least five years a week for more than one hour a day risk the permanent loss of their hearing.”
"I'm worried that such a large number of young people who usually set portable music devices and mobile phones to a high volume will irretrievably damage their hearing without knowing it," said Meglena Kuneva.
"From the scientific findings – it is said on the part of the Eu – there is a clear risk, which pushes to act quickly.
What really matters is to sensitize consumers and turn that information into common good.
In view of these scientific findings, we must re-examine the existing control systems so that they are fully effective and keep pace with the new technology."
Brussels had commissioned the independent scientific committee in the face of widespread use of the portable music equipment among young people.
"The scientists, including the EU communication, confirm that they are rightly concerned and that the EU Commission, together with the other Eu members and the stakeholders, will now examine the necessary measures to better protect children and young people from the noise that comes from portable music devices and similar devices ".
A European standard already exists at the moment, limiting the level of noise from portable music devices to 100 dB. The concern about the damage that could come from too much noise pollution.
You can limit these damages very much by resorting to solutions such as reducing the volume and the length of the noise suspension.
In their report, the Eu Scientific Committee points out that if users of portable music devices listen to music for only five hours a week (louder than 89 decibels) so that the legal limits that apply to the maximum noise level at the workplace have already been exceeded.
Those who cross music this line risk the complete loss of hearing within five years.
This would therefore affect 5-10% of users of such devices, the number of which can be estimated at between 2.5 and 10 million people in the Eu.
Roma, Alemanno gives the go-ahead to the "Commission for the Future of the Capital"
We're starting today, it's supposed to be over in March, and a record will be taken in June.
This is the procedure set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital Rome". The Commission met this morning in the new seat behind the Caracalla thermal baths.
In six months, President Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the leadership lines for Rome.
Once the project is completed, the city and local council will evaluate the analyses and projects to be able to present the strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of the Capitol and Lord Mayor Gianni Alemanno in June.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural opinions are represented in it," - emphasizes Alemanno. "She will make proposals for a development plan for Rome, whose political leaders remain the city and local council.
There is no redistribution of responsibilities, only the will to have a place where you can develop a great project for Rome.
Their task will be completed in March and the Commission will disintegrate again, as such a project must have a time-determined endpoint.
In June, the Lord Mayor announces, we will present the strategic plan in which we will use the work done by the Commission."
Those who question the Commission's competence, since their opinion is lacking in commitment, Alemanno replies: "Everything depends on the work that the Commission will do and on the quality of its proposals.
If, as in France, the Attali Commission, it delivers high-quality results – and this will certainly be the case in Rome – then their contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics deals with the everyday problems and emergencies that occur from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to keep an eye on a longer period of time, in order to work seriously on the development of Rome and the future of the city in a deeper perspective."
The Lord Mayor of Rome attaches great importance to clarifying the following "This commission is neither a useless institution nor a wreck: it is absolutely free, it will not cost the Roman citizens a penny and it will make us think. She will keep the best minds in the capital.”
According to Alemanno, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan that is neither hermetic nor static in order to enable our city to take a leap in quality - which it really needs - and thus take a joint step into the future."
A future, according to the Lord Mayor of Rome, which "will not only be limited in the current municipal borders, but will look much further," not only with regard to the role of Rome as the metropolis and political capital of Italy, but also as the future capital of Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama – the first anti-American president? Here's an explanation
A well-known American politician who is much concerned with being considered independent has written: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who decimated the U.S. economy through his decisions, and who maintained relations with hostile Islam (and still does so today as a private man).
The attacks against Obama are getting more and more violent, especially now that the election is approaching.
A lady from Miami wrote on an internet page: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama is very cheeky: he thinks he will be given the highest office of a nation that has seen a total of two black governors and five black senators!"
Actually, however, these attacks do not have much to say; they are racist attacks and they do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls, too; everyone says Obama will win by a big lead.
In this case, too, there are people who talk to the heart and not to the head.
A newspaper from Mississippi, in the deepest south of the United States, has written in its editorial: only in the voting booth will we know who the real American patriot will give his vote to.
Here comes a U.S. mentality that was kept hidden until last.
"Say what you want, then we'll decide who we're going to make our creep for, whether for Obama or for McCain."
There are people there who swear: if Obama wins, we will emigrate from America.
Something you never heard before – only now that the success of the black candidate seems so certain.
In any case, despite all these considerations, the final weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
1500 people were questioned: What mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? 89% have responded: the war in Iraq.
America is changing.
The nation lost 50000 troops in Vietnam and was sent home with a kick in the butt.
In Iraq, 4500 troops have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack.
Even so, Iraq remains Bush's weak point for the majority.
The one who will take his place faces a huge task.
USA. The financial collapse also leaves its mark on journalists: in the newspapers you can already feel the cuts. And many accuse the Internet, the "murderer" of the printing press.
Five hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about their situation and mental control about the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
Nevertheless, they did not really express concern to those who were responsible for the information.
They don't feel as alone as they used to be.
The problem for American journalists is money.
The crisis of 2008 is a crisis for these journalists of an economic model that has been destroyed.
In addition, there are the big problems caused by the cuts that hit the newsroom, i.e. the space in which the editors work to put together the newspaper.
It is a problem that must be solved – according to the interviewed journalists – if you want to prevent traditional journalism, as the large audience understands it, not shrink significantly.
A clear but complicated pessimism fills the American journalist today.
Six out of ten journalists and executive seniors of the printing press believe that journalism is on the wrong track at the national level.
In the local area, the executives are even around 65%.
Printed vs. Broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to imagine which direction the web is going.
The most important publishing groups are making their way to the Internet, which is considered by many to be the "killer" of the printing press.
The "economic pressure" that journalists are feeling has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted to joining the new technology, hoping "it brings something good for journalism."
The biggest rift in American journalism today is between the editors-in-chief of the newsroom and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national-level editors are certain that their reporters share their values with them, while at the local level, it is only 23%.
Some think it has to do with "safety at work."
The farm managers who are afraid of losing their jobs within three years are 47% at the national level.
For journalists, it is 30%.
The topic of "safe work" in the team (our "Editors", ed. Red.) is always a topical topic in the USA.
Only 13% of journalists work under contract.
In a vast nation, as is the U.S., with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio and TV stations and Internet operators, employers like it are offering and so it becomes a question of take it or leave it.
The editors-in-chief very often receive very high wages, the editor, on the other hand, can sometimes only get 10000 euros per month, plus pension and insurance money.
As for the holiday, the matter becomes complicated: a certain amount of days in the first year, so and so many after the third, to finally reach 15 vacation days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, as they themselves admit, frequently "sick" throughout the year.
It is a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME: DANILO COPPOLA REMAINS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Court in Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the real estate agent's request. He had asked to be transferred from Grottaferrata to Rome.
It is investigating Coppola for bank red in the context of the investigation into the counter-agreement in the case of the acquisition of Unipol-Bnl.
In the course of the trial against him during last week, his release from house arrest was converted into a residence requirement in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked to allow the real estate agent to be transferred from the provincial city to an apartment in the capital.
According to the court, such transfers (against which the public prosecutor's office had opposed) could give him the opportunity to influence his company and obtain accusing evidence.
The elite are in danger
The phenomenon had already revealed itself a few days ago, when the Chamber of Deputies voted against the 700 billion-dollar White House austerity package: A large proportion of Americans were and are more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is confirmed by yesterday's edition of the New York Times, which reports on how the crisis in the running step divides the Republican Party, which is increasingly divided into its old and moderate East Coast soul, which always favored the state institutions and the business community and that neoconservative, which is "hostile to those in Washington" and the financial world and wins voters, especially in the South and the center of the states.
This part of the party owes its rise mainly to the voice of the one I mentioned above.
This example, which has just been mentioned, is only a small part of the major changes that the current economic earthquake announces or even represents: not only in the USA, but also in the entire West and perhaps beyond it, will be affected by these.
In both the States and Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating the long-feared events that are finally taking shape and coming to light under these new conditions.
The first of these phenomena is the new discovery, the unheard-of renaissance of the state in conjunction with a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis means a decline of the banking and financial institutions, which have close ties to foreign countries and at the same time manage a tremendous amount of the assets of private households that reside in a single state.
This means a direct political problem for governments: namely, how to behave towards the families concerned, which is also an enormous voter mass.
So the crisis seems economically global, politically it is almost purely national.
Political internationalism seems to have fallen offside and lost its right to speak: the clear proof of this has been given by the EU, which, due to its division into various national and international conflicts, does not know how to find a common path.
Therefore, everyone now expects the intervention of their own state; rescue plans, new rules, and above all. Distribution of relief funds: Since the crisis has become increasingly serious, only the US in the economic situation can be saved without outside help.
And in addition to the means, they also have the legitimacy to use these: thus two conditions not to be overestimated – under certain circumstances – which otherwise no international organization and no market will be able to resort in a similar way.
That new emphasis, which is placed on the state-national element, is, moreover, in perfect line with the ever-increasing importance recently associated in the economy with a closely related sector: territoriality.
It is paradoxical precisely now that we have been so convinced of having long since entered into a networked whole empire, into a realm of ever-differentiated technologies, of the intangible, that we suddenly have to realize how our future will depend more and more on the essential material things: water, harvest and oil.
Although these can certainly all be transported from one place to another in the world, they are still connected to the utmost with a narrowly circumscribed piece of earth – a territory.
Therefore, the one who has such territory is at an advantage over another who lives in a territory that is fruitless, waterless or free of oil occurrences.
I now come to the second novelty, which, however, requires a short push-in.
Who territory, who government, who says politics, also says leadership.
In this sense, the financial crisis seems to produce two converging phenomena.
On the one hand, there is the knowledge of the need for respected leaderships, that is, the need for someone who knows how to regulate things.
On the other hand, there is now a wave of indignation over the existing leaderships, especially those of economics, which have turned out to be inadequate and full of shadow zones.
Finally, there is a deeper and, in a sense, still disturbing aspect: a loss of trust, an imperfection, a picture of inappropriation, a sense of distance, all of which is aimed at a whole class of managers of the Western countries.
It seems that the conviction among large sections of the population is paving the way that it is not only the deeds of the social elite, but already their world of ideas, their way of life, their culture in the broadest sense of the word, whose content is presented to the majority as increasingly foreign and overwhelmed.
The demand for leadership thus feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of the disempowerment of the leading class and the conventional political establishment. This manifests itself in unforeseen "revolts" of voters and in the sudden shift of the collective state of mind of recent times: starting with the rise of the Conservatives in Austria and Bavaria, over the collapse of the Labour party in Britain, towards the rebellion of American MPs against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy also plays a role here).
One gets the impression that the old elite, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, magazines, intellectual creditors, some would say their format, more and more understanding problems and therefore less representative value in terms of what is going on in the lower social strata of the West today and is further amplified by the financial crisis and up to over-dimensionality.
In view of all this, it would simply be exaggerated to speak of a "rebellion of the masses".
But keeping your eyes wide open is certainly not.
The super glue that lets go up on walls
To be able to defeat the forces of gravity thanks to an adhesive and to be able to climb up walls like Superman.
This is the subject of four American research centers, one of which is now seemingly almost at the destination.
With an adhesive applied on an area of only 2.5 sqm, the researchers have succeeded in fixing a body weighing 100 kg on a vertical wall.
The STUDIO – an American journal has published the findings of the researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the research team is a further development of the adhesives already used, which use a special carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
"The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of stacks of spaghetti arranged tubes," explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists have taken inspiration from the feet of the geckos, which are covered by microscopic hairs that give the animal a perfect hold.
The tests, conducted with various materials such as glass Teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new glue is ten times stronger than the holding capability of the reptiles' feet and at the same time "causes it to be easily removed from the wall," according to Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
WALKING ALONG WALLS? "This material could be used as an ephemeral adhesive," Liming Dai adds.
Like Spiderman on walls? Perhaps, but the researchers are thinking of a less fascinating benefit, such as the connection of electrical devices, because the nanotubes are also conductors of heat and electricity.
Further areas of application could fall within the field of space travel.
So for now, the superheroes still have to wait.
THE OTHER TYPE OF RESEARCH – also the University of Berkeley, California, is dedicated to a new type of glue.
In an article in an article by the American Chemical Society, the Californian scientists present an adhesive made of microfibers that, like hair, cleanse themselves from the dust by movement on a surface and thus always maintain perfect adhesion.
Medicines: never take with fruit juice
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, which are consumed in the summer due to their refreshing quality and vitamin richness, can cause serious damage to health if they are taken with certain vital drugs at the same time, since they can have an extreme effect on the absorption of these by the body.
David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, repeatedly points to the risk of packaged as well as fresh fruit juices associated with medication intake. In the context of the 236. Meetings of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia he sounded the alarm again: It is enough for a glass of apple, orange or grapefruit juice to reduce the absorption capacity of certain vital drugs to such an extent that they are virtually eliminated and thus the health of the patients is endangered.
Grapefruit juice was already under suspicion of being responsible for increasing the effects of some drugs such as antibiotics, anti-asthmatics, cardiovascular drugs, anxiolytic and neurological agents, up to toxic levels.
MEDICATIONS IN DANGER – The same agency of the drug had warned doctors and patients about the dangers of this mix in a report two years ago, and emphasized paying attention to what is drunk in conjunction with means such as diazepan or metadon.
IT’S NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – according to the experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that can inhibit the medicines.
The list of active ingredients inhibited by the fruit juices is long.
Therefore, the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the Università Statale di Milano: "Such results are usually immediately forwarded to the various international manufacturers, who are so free to change the consumer information.
Therefore, it is advisable to always read the package leaflet and, if there are still ambiguities, no shyness to ask a pharmacist or doctor," emphasizes the expert of the Ansa agency.
Nobel Prize goes to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics is to the American Paul Krugman for his analysis of trade patterns and the settlement of economic activities.
The 55-year-old Krugman is a neo-Keynesian who teaches at the University of Princeton and is known for his regular articles for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration's economic and foreign policy.
A few months after the attacks of 11. In a New York Times editorial, Krugman had claimed in a New York Times editorial that this second event was more crucial to U.S. history than the assassinations.
A prediction that received not a little polemic in response and which economists were still kept years later, but today it proves to be completely correct.
"I am surprised and also shocked by how quickly the memory of the scandals in the context of the collapses of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public field of vision," Krugman explained in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is an "econom of great value," but also a banalizer with a "very aggressive style that is particularly directed against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration."
Open Office, the third version of the "Anti-Microsoft" package will be released
The day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0 has come; the open source software is gaining an ever-increasing number of users, both at home and in the office, both among freelancers and in public administration, as a free replacement for Microsoft’s Office.
After a year of intensive work by the volunteer developers, which is monitored by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now presenting itself to the audience with some novelties: in addition to a revised and now more spartan designed initial menu, a basic compatibility with Apple's operating system Mac OS x is now finally achieved, as well as the support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format, i.e. the latest standard ISO version.
Eight against was also the compatibility with Microsoft's Office 2007, whose new formats (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx) can be read by OpenOffice.
Also interesting are some new features, such as the one that allows to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, which is e.g. B. facilitates sending via email. This also includes the possibility to import PDF files into graphic editing modules and at the same time preserve the original appearance of the page.
Thus, "hybrid" PDF files can now also be generated, which extend the typical graphic of the Adobe format with the elements of a table and a word processing system.
Collaboration is one of the most improved elements of the applications: tables can now be edited more-handed by different users, avoiding conflicts in the event of changes; in the case of the word processing system, each editor is assigned a color to guarantee a better correction procedure.
Some companies are currently in the process of publishing various features of OpenOffice on the Internet (on the cloud), while the final result is to be made public in the coming weeks.
The Italian version is available for download on the following link: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html. Thus, it follows the English version, which has been on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the program is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, you can have the installation CD sent to your home or office.
However, if the freedom of costs can be an incentive for the dissemination of the program in private households, it is also in the area of business, where OpenOffice could succeed in the great litter: after all, various institutions of the public administration and schools have already moved to OpenOffice.
In fact, there is not even a lack of a training offer, which means optimal help for small and medium-sized companies, and thus even opens up business prospects.
OpenOffice consists of five main components: Writer, the Word corresponding copy creation program; Calc, the table program that aims to suppress Excel; Impress, for creating presentations as with Powerpoint; Dbase for operating databases in place of the better-known access; and most recently Draw, a graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads – a goal that can be easily exceeded with 3 million and 600 thousand already achieved.
Kohl also tested positive, making him the fourth doping case
A new doping case opens in the context of the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian athlete Bernhard Kohl of the team Gerolsteiner, the third-classified and winner of the jersey of the best climber.
The news was published by the daily newspaper L'Equipe on its website.
The 26-year-old Kohl of Team Gerolsteiner is the fourth driver to test positive for Cera, the third-generation Epo. Previously, this was already the case with the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli as well as the German Stefan Schumacher.
The analyses from Kohl’s blood samples are among those carried out in recent weeks by the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-rehearsals now confirm the positive results on Cera, the Austrian will lose his third place and will be excluded from the races for two years.
The head of the French Anti-Doping Commission Pierre Bordry confirmed the positive epotest, and according to the Associated Press also notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian climbed on the podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans and also claimed the jersey of the best climber for himself.
THEME OF IMMIGRATION: THE NEW YORK TIMES ASKS: IS ITALY RACIAL?
Italy, "the former country of the emigrants has recently become one of the preferred countries for immigrants," which are only taken up with reluctance.
Does this make the Belpaese a nation of racists? This is what the New York Times asks in a lengthy article entirely dedicated to the issue of racism in Italy and stems from the case of the young, Burkina-based Abdul William Guibre, who was murdered in Milan a month ago after stealing a pack of cookies.
The case testifies to what the Times calls the "paradox of the North": the northern regions are those where "the most integration and job opportunities" exist, and yet "the highest degree of anti-immigration sentiments and the biggest support of the Northern League" is to be seen.
As confirmation of the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the Times cites further episodes of intolerance from Milan, Rome, Parma, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
And not just this.
The new legislation against immigration introduced by the League and the faster expulsion of illegal immigrants is also cited as a sign of climate change in Italy.
A movement that the Pope and the President also underline: "Giorgio Napolitano asked the Pope at a meeting at the Quirinal for cooperation between the Church and the State to combat racism."
The small plane of the billionaire Steve Fossett, which disappeared a year ago, found again
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the one on 3. Billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert in September 2007 was found.
The individual parts have been found on a high plateau of 3000 m altitude, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
Inside the plane, however, there were no human remains.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely invalidated the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, on which a force was sent out. Now we have the assurance that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance.
Mr. Anderson also further confirmed that no human remains were found on the plane or its proximity.
The 63-year-old billionaire was pronounced dead in February.
The American Office of Road Safety (Ntsb) noted that a few hours after the sighting of the aircraft, a crew was sent out who identified the aircraft: it is the Bellanca 8kcab, which was identified on the 3rd. Lost in September 2007 after Fossett took off for a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett's personal belongings were finally found in California, not far from the Nevada border, by a couple near their home on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two IDs with the name Fossetts, both of which had been issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had conquered a place in history through a long episode of records.
In 2002, he succeeded in the sixth attempt, as the first person to circle the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without a stopover with a plane.
Among his several records is also a high of 15445 m over the Andes, but this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the commercial you don't expect
A suv that falls out of the conventional schemes due to its original design and special lines, the sweeping surface and its clear angles.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new breath into the sector.
It is precisely because of its extraordinary features that the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be shown in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz from 17, October.
Thus, the advertising drum, which will accompany the appearance of the new model, will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – a novelty in the car sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will take in different chamfers, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until the 15th. November is to be carried out.
The first bevel will consist of the presentation of the car in form, whereby 3D glasses, which are distributed near the Corso Como, should give the whole a special look: the new Suv will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear to emerge from the poster on which it is pictured.
Then, with the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is illuminated in all its details in different moments in order to reassemble itself as a whole.
Undoubtedly, it is the concern of Mercedes with this advertising to introduce a new kind of car complaint into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it be possible to stimulate the interest of future buyers? We'll see.
It is now clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadium ban
Who are only these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
There have never been any clashes with opposing fans so far.
The origin of the group lies in the right-wing environment.
The sponsors are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, other smaller groups from Campania and Puglia joined.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: these were, however, removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it came to a collision with a truly right-wing fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 tickets for the game: all were on display in name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among those who had travelled to Sofia, there was no one with an ongoing stadium ban procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already burdened in this regard, were thus also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified Tifosi in the riots can expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer set foot in a stadium.
Thankfully.
But now, of course, there is fear of copycats, who could follow these little more than 150.
"This fire must be resigned immediately, and in no case give such behavior the opportunity to justify," the Viminal said.
Therefore, "eyes on especially with regard to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Puglia.
Tomorrow, the Osservatorio (Sports Supervisory Board) will gather on Tuesday, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services, which deal with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria, this is not a criminal offence..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (significantly expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio at the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and on it Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chief of Trieste, where a core of the supporters of the Ultras Italia, founded in 2002, now comes from.
While it is true, says Mazzilli, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but undoubtedly the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I’m not a sociologist, add the No. 1 of the Osservatorio – Crimes are punished in the land of their act.
Until now, this group had kept in check, but now it is necessary to reconsider what has happened and will happen.
But we are also talking about the whistles during the hymn of Mameli: this is not a criminal offence, but allow me, because the education is missing..."
Students Victims of up to 900 euros per room high rental prices
The market for housing for students knows no crises.
According to the last investigation of the Sunia, the tenants' union, a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
"This phenomenon has already taken on very serious features. Entire groups of students are so effectively losing their right to study, as their families are unable to support them at this level," said Laura Mariani, the Sunia's executive, "in these cities, the great demand from students leads to a deformity of the market, which has also harmed the other inhabitants.
In addition, most rental offers include a number of violations: free contracts, missing registrations, without rent limit, unauthorized sublets.
For the Sunia, there is a need for exceptional measures, which lead to lower rental prices by overhauling taxation.
On closer examination of the investigation, it turns out that in Milan a place to sleep in the Brianza district approx. 450 euros are needed; a single room starts at 650 euros (in the neighborhood gang nere) and ends with 800 euros in the neighborhood of Lambiate, Udine and Fiera or even 900 euros in the neighborhood of Vittoria.
In Florence, a sleeping place costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the neighborhoods around the university, 250/280 euros for a place to sleep are from hardship, 370 to 500 for a single room.
In Rome, the prices in the neighborhoods around the university are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a sleeping place in a double room.
Rents in the neighborhoods around the other universities of Rome are only slightly lower: 550 euros in East Iense and Cinecittà.
Only those who dodge to outskirts can save money: 300 euros for a sleeping place and 450 euros for a single room in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar quarters.
In Naples you need 300-450 euros for a place to sleep, for a room the price is between 400 and 600 euros in the most expensive quarters, the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari, a sleeping place costs 250-350 euros, a single room at least 350.
In the smallest cities, prices are lower, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-European students is more common, such as in Perugia, there is even another anomaly: a rent that is 25-30% above average is required by foreign students.
Goodbye to the old Paradiso cinema – the cities close their historic cinemas
Historic cinemas are closing due to the beneficiary multiplex cinemas.
"A city without cinema halls is a blind city, like a face without eyes."
This picture by the director Giuseppe Tornatore describes with effect what is currently happening in the large urban centers of Italy, and also in the provinces.
The process of exclusion of cinemas, which began with the birth of the great multi-room complexes in the periphery, means death in the long run for the single-room cinema in the center. A process that not only seems inevitable and irrevocable, but also carries the features of a cultural crime.
Most of the time, historical places full of memories are affected, "it's like losing a friend with whom you have put a piece of street full of emotions back," according to the director of the film "Nuovo Cinema Paradiso," which earned him the Oscar and the Cannes Grand Prix 20 years ago. It is the story of a suburban cinema and its nostalgia, which consists of living in a forever lost cinema world.
The figures provided by the Anec, the central trade association, speak for themselves: in the last five years, the enormous amount of 316 traditional cinemas have had to close; these collierys mostly paid for the cinemas in the big cities: 10 in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the worst-hit regions are Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost cinemas, followed by Tuscany with 44 and Lombardy with 41.
This testifies to the fact that the main culprits are the multiplex cinemas, because it is precisely these three regions in which the largest number of these modern cinemas has been registered: with 195 in the last 5 years, Lombardy tops the lists, 81 are in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
"The business has developed in an irrational way," says Paolo Protti, the president of the Anec, "it is useful that new structures also emerge, but in the first place is the preservation of the already existing one, because if a hall in the city closes, not all its regular customers are ready to visit a multiplex cinema in the periphery instead of the old one.
And here remains the missing budget for the fund of the trade association outside eight: the debt burden recorded by the state is approx. 10 million euros.
It is a shame from the ethical-moral point of view that the government does not observe the existing laws.
To preserve the sector, between 16 and 18 million euros a year would be necessary."
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, because of the fears surrounding the old cinema halls, has decided to protect it by an agreement between the municipality and the Anec; it is the first agreement of its kind in Italy aimed at protecting and supporting traditional cinemas, both in the historical center and in the periphery.
Among the foreseen measures are also tax advantages for the cinema operators as well as advantages for the public regarding local transport: it will be allowed to drive to the traffic-limited areas of the center and also to park at cheaper parking fees.
"It is a pleasing initiative," says Giuseppe Tornatore, "I hope that other cities will join our example and also design new concepts.
But we certainly also need better audio and video equipment to be able to do something against the superpower of the multiplex halls, because after all, the audience of today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema has always been an important topic for me: the closure of the "Supercinema" of Baghiera, the place of my childhood and youth, was the decisive point that led me to found the "Nuovo cinema Paradiso", even if I had been playing with the idea for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years; when I pass the Rialto or Quirinale in Via Nazionale, where I have experienced so many different emotions, I turn to the side so that I do not have to see the dust-covered posters.
The links between politics and 'Ndrangheta lead to the arrest of the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was ready to adapt the decisions of the community to the interests of the Mafia group Piromalli.
The accusations of the legal profession of the Antimafia authority of Calabria against the mayor Giorgio Dal Torrione and his deputy Rosario Schiavone of the municipality of Gioia Tauro, which were arrested this morning for involvement in mafia business, are serious.
In handcuffs, Gioacchino Piromalli, the older mediator between the clan and the public administration, as well as his nephew: the lawyer, who bears the same name as the boss of the clan, had already been sentenced for involvement in criminal associations of the Mafia, at that time to a compensation amount of 10 million euros.
"Disregarding any kind of moral and legal norm," the lawyers write, "the two local administrations had decided to pay the lawyer Piromalli funds for advisory activities."
“Thus, it had been made possible for the Mafia group – according to the judges – to enter the town halls on an official path and to have a say in the politics of the public administration.”
The President of the Regional Committee of Calabria Agazio Loiero does not deny that in his region it is "anything but an exception to encounter links from local administrations and organized crime." "There are places where the concentration of the Mafia is greater than in others, in which such connections are practically inevitable.
But there are also local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'Ndrangheta: heroes who sustain themselves a white vest.'
This morning's arrests follow those of last July, with which, according to the police, the clan Piromalli was beheaded.
Since the end of last April, the local council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, but already in 1991 – and also at that time due to alleged links between organized crime and the local administration – the local politicians had been removed from their municipal offices.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, then mayor of the Udc, was elected head of the center rights coalition after the run-off election of May 2006.
He shouted scandal as the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the local council.
He was prosecuted for the Deputy Interior Minister Marco Minniti, whom he accused of having invented everything for political-strategic reasons. But the judges, in connection with this morning's arrest warrant, declare that the Piromalli clan had even dared to request a change to the A3 project.
From an eavesdropping operation in connection with the investigations into the Dal Torrione case, the willingness to meet the wishes of an entrepreneur who is known to be a representative of the large group around the Piromalli has shown himself to be identical to the interests of this clan.
When the energy springs from the waves, suddenly the big ones run up
It is a non-swelling source of money that covers over 70% of the planet's surface and only now do the world's big energy companies seem to understand this.
Waves, currents and tides are the new renewable energy sources that everyone is now looking at, and also to occupy, such as giants such as Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has already been considered and investigated for 70 years; it is not by chance that these studies have intensified considerably since the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil collapsed around 1980, the idea of marine energy was gassed, but now the environmental organizations and the increased oil price are pushing for new stimulus in this sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimates that 15% of the world's energy demand could be met by the energies generated by the ocean waves.
This would be twice the energy currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there would be the currents and tides.
Giants in attack.
The first company to rely on marine energy is Enersis, which signed a contract in 2005 to build a power plant in northern Portugal.
When this news was published, it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years later, there are now more and more companies from the traditional energy industry that rely on marine energy production.
"Chevron is investigating these technologies," he said, spokesman for a company known to the U.S. giant in the Wall Street Journal, and is weighing the opportunity to work with us."
It is about obtaining an approval from the American Energy Commission, which is necessary to start a project off the coast of Alaska.
This is a not to be underestimated sign, especially considering that oil is still being extracted by the US, especially in Alaska, and President Bush recently launched the plans for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, the companies Verdant Power Inc. from New York and Ocean Power from New Jersey, which invest in the new industry, are also not known, so observers speak of a rising interest.
Technologies that are still worth improvement.
Experts speak of a technology still on the rise, not least because the last doubts on the part of the environmentalists have not yet been clarified.
So far, projects such as those in Portugal and Scotland are of a rather small dimension and do not seem to cause any serious ecological problems.
However, in order to produce energy on a large scale, technologies with a far greater impact on the environment are needed.
There are different possibilities: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of connected buoys.
The thrust of the shafts, which moves the buoys up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure within the floats via pistons and cylinders.
This drives a turbine, which in turn operates a generator.
The electricity is sent to the coast via underwater lines.
So far, there are four planned plants of this kind, which are only waiting for the state approval. Some of the energy gained could also serve for military facilities.
Verdant Power, meanwhile, is already producing energy for a department store and a parking lot using underwater turbines in the East River of New York.
The water movements during the tides drive the turbines, which feeds the generator by the resulting rotational movement.
According to Verdant, a long queue of possible clients is already waiting for the necessary authorizations to use these energy sources.
First the waves, then the tides.
According to the Institute for Electricity Generation Research, the potential that is in the tides deserves a special interest at the moment.
Although it is also an irregular phenomenon, the tides are more predictable than wind currents, solar radiation and also waves, and therefore a more trustworthy source of electricity.
Especially the tidal energy is which states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as other coastal states, have already invested 7.5 million dollars in 2008 – up to 35 million are already planned for 2009.
