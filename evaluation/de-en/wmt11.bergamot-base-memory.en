What should she do, the ČSSD? The Czech Social Democrats in Prague know neither Voldemort nor the "confectionery".
The new councillors of the capital from the ranks of the ČSSD will obviously have to overcome certain language barriers in order to be able to understand their old-new colleagues from the ODS in the Prague Council and in the city representation.
The newspaper Aktuálně.cz has once a little "knocked" members of the new council from the ČSSD, as they master the notorious slang that has become naturalized in recent years, in which today's coalition partners were at the helm in Prague.
The encoded vocabulary, introduced by the Prague political elite in the past era of Lord Mayor Pavel Bém, is borrowed from some of the best-known actors, situations and cases.
Surprisingly, it turned out that the new councils are somewhat in the dark in terms of those new terms.
At least they say that.
"Who is Voldemort?"
"I don't know."
"I am more of a newcomer to Prague politics," Lukáš Kaucký, the new councillor for culture, responded to the test of the "godfather vocabulary."
But councillor Karel Březina - a political veteran - also reacted in a similar way.
For example, the term "golf hole."
"That's the only expression of those you're putting before me here that I use every now and then."
"Otherwise, I don't think much of slang."
From the vocabulary published by the daily newspaper Aktuálně.cz in this year's June before the ODS Election Congress, the editorial team picked out six terms, especially those that are notoriously linked to the Prague Magistrate.
The Social Democrats should define the terms "Voldemort," "largest Prague golf hole," "go to the pastry shop," "bull-naked," "betrayal of the capital" and "plate."
Three Prague councillors agreed to the test, the fourth - Antonín Weinert, the future head of the Prague school system - promised first his participation in the conversation, but then did not even take the listener.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dolínek, rejected the test from the outset.
"I don't care about these things and how the bourgeois Democrats talk to each other, I don't judge."
"For me, it's important how we understand each other as part of our programs," he countered.
As already indicated, Lukáš Kaucký in the above-mentioned headline allegedly would not have recognized that the influential entrepreneur and friend of the former Lord Mayor Bém, Roman Janoušek, is mentioned.
The term "Voldemort" says Kaucky nothing at all and the only term he correctly used to do during the test was "the biggest Prague golf hole."
"This is the Blanka tunnel," says Kaucký, but added to the safety: "But I know that rather from the newspaper."
And jokingly, "I'm probably going to have to take a language course."
The "golf hole" is then correctly deciphered not only by Matador Karel Březina, but also by the councillor for environmental issues Lukáš Plachý as tunnel blank.
But both Social Democrats also know who the term Voldemort stands for and Lukáš Plachý even suspects where this figure can be found and thus also what it means to "go to the pastry shop".
"I think that means going to some Prague restaurant," Plachý is pretty close to the mystery solution, if you know that this is the headquarters of Janoušek's companies.
However, in agreement with Březina, he claims to have drawn this knowledge from the newspaper rather than that this vocabulary would be his own.
Judging by the test participants, there actually does not seem to be a similarly naturalized slang among the Social Democrats.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing with us."
"We call ourselves by name, every now and then we also use abbreviations or nicknames," says the chairman of the Prague ČSSD Petr Hulínský - called "Hulda" by his party colleagues.
"In school I was called Bříza (birch), but I don't know if my colleagues call me that," Karel Březina tells us his nickname.
The newspaper Deník Aktuálně.cz has tried the name and lo and behold - it works.
Councillor Weinert is friendly to the party comrades the "Grandpa" or less friendly the "old", the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to himself before the elections through machinations at the party sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (well-known Czech Lego figure).
Nicknames are the only thing that the Social Democrats allow in intra-party language.
Hulínský supposedly doesn't like it when you call him "Hulda," but Deník Aktuálně.cz registered yet another nickname of the Prague chairman.
His nickname, "Doctor of the Rubber Club Rights," allegedly has to do with the fact that Petr Hulínský has earned his title Doctor juris at the Bratislav Police Academy.
The government wants to stop the torture of "witches" and issued a brochure
Women who are labeled witches in Burkina Faso usually have some common social characteristics.
They are more likely to belong to the older generation, they find no work - for example, for health reasons, they are single and have no children.
If one of these women becomes a witch, she is strictly isolated so that she cannot become dangerous to the rest of the village.
"Men are quite rarely affected by this fate."
"Even young and healthy women are spared this, as they help with work and give birth to children," a nun describes the situation that takes care of more than one hundred women in the capital of the West African state of Burkina Faso in a special home, who were ejected by their communities.
The local government now decided to take action against this abnormal "social measure."
And for this reason, issued a brochure that is intended to prevent the "witch's persecution".
But the matter has a catch.
"More than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso cannot read," the newspaper DerStandard pointed out of the dilemma of written enlightenment.
However, being accused of witchcraft is also commonplace in other African countries.
In Ghana, the neighboring country of Burkina Faso, 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was tortured to death by three women and two men - they doused them with petroleum and simply set them on fire.
The BBC also reported on this incident.
The perpetrators, however, claimed that the matter was only a coincidence of unfortunate circumstances.
According to their version, oil is inflamed, which is used for ritual anointings.
This is after the group tried to "expel an evil spirit" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" support the people here without regard to their education.
"The Standard" quoted a 42-year-old entrepreneur from Burkina Faso: "Eaters of human souls are a danger in the past as they are today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to defuse the witch hunt, the Gambian president himself has been involved in the past year.
"President Yahya Jammeh sparked a monstrous witch hunt after the death of his aunt, as they allegedly played a part in their deaths and would now try to kill the president himself through black magic."
"To this end, he called on shamans from nearby Guinea to help, who, accompanied by police, soldiers and the president's bodyguard, forcibly kidnapped women and men indiscriminately from Gambian villages and brought them to the president's farm in Kanilai," Amnesty International said in its report.
On the farm, the incarcerated people were forced to drink an absud from plants with hallucinogenic effect, but which also caused intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested people did not survive the stay on the farm.
It was only because of international pressure that the nearly a thousand prisoners were released.
A tenant of Bakala: He heats in the oven - nevertheless, higher rent pays
An older reduced man is leaving the client center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal baron" Zdeněk Bakala, the largest private owner of rental apartments in the Czech Republic.
Under the arm a folder with three new leases to three apartments: for his daughters' and his daughter's homes and his son, who is currently serving a prison sentence.
All three were in the context of the so-called. "Deregulation" just increased the rent.
Instead of 3500 kronor monthly rent, the son is to rape 4100 crowns next year for a 2-room apartment with kitchen of the second category.
"And there is not even running warm water in the apartment and you have to heat in a simple coal stove," he taps with the finger annoyed on the new lease of the son, to whose signing he has a power of attorney.
"But what - I signed," he explains half-detuned and half resigned.
The citizens' association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and immoral," advises tenants to simply not sign the new contracts and by 7. Waiting for December to publish instructions on how to combat such contracts.
But the man just waves off.
"One says this, the other says that," he makes a sinister face.
The Ostrava region thus becomes the big "deregulation laboratory."
After New Year's, this deregulation is imminent for most rental apartments in the Czech Republic, whose tenants do not yet pay market-friendly rent.
Aktuálně.cz therefore decided to visit this "lab" in person.
The RPG waiting room in Havířov is one of four in the Ostrava region and already nine o'clock in the morning this Tuesday.
Right next to the door are the bodyguards of a security agency and with it a call device.
"Rent 2011" is how a special touch panel on the touchscreen lights up.
Briefly tapped and the device spits out a numbered slip.
No sooner have we deciphered the number "157" than it beeps on the large display on the ceiling of the waiting room.
Half a second later it's your turn.
A little later, an elderly couple enters the waiting room to ask for the rent, but the rush in the waiting room apparently does not even apply to the new rent.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repair requests, insurance matters and the like.
From mid-November, the envelopes with the new leases will flutter into the mailboxes of most of the tenants of the total of 44,000 apartments in the portfolio of the RPG.
The RPG Byty beats them in the letters a rent increase of approx. 15 to 38 percent before.
The special switch for the new rents in the client center has been since the 18th. November open.
"The action runs a little over a week, that is, that's just the beginning," the ladies behind the switch respond after a moment of hesitation when the "client" turns out to be a journalist.
The deregulation and bakala's former miner's housing is an explosive issue.
Before the elections, the President of the Parliament Lubomír Zaorálek of the ČSSD, who is from Ostrava, had taken up this topic quite loudly, no wonder that today the newspapers are full of them.
"Twenty years I want a new floor from them."
"Not even ne besch. Toilet glasses could replace them," the aforementioned man makes himself air.
So far, according to the employees, pensioners are mainly at the counter to convince themselves whether they really receive the promised rent reduction, which promises them RPG, if they sign the special offer in time.
The other tenants, who the new lease until 15, are also to benefit from a half-reduced February rent Sign December.
So far, however, "deregulation switch" in Havířov is anything but overloaded with demand.
"Of yesterday's 360 clients, only about 40 to 50 of the rent in 2011 were here," estimate the switch officials.
RPG offers individual rental agreements on their websites as well as wall panels where it seems necessary.
However, if the rental parties do not agree on the new rent, it will be determined by an independent court.
"This should not be a threat, but should be understood as information about the only possible and completely legitimate legal procedure," explains RPG on its websites.
"No one goes to court here," says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man on the street in front of the client center at least partially agrees with her.
"I have 13,000 (crowns) pension, of which I have 5,000 left for food, where should I get the money for a court dispute," he says.
Then the employee will be insecure.
"Let's see."
"Mr Zaorálek tells them about the media not to sign and so people are still waiting," she admits.
The regulated rent ends in most of the Czech Republic on New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty, the rent increase is an economic necessity.
"The existing amount of rents is not even enough to maintain the housing fund," argues Pavel Klimeš, the director of the housing portfolio of the company RPG Byty and - especially the neglect of the housing fund criticized by the angry tenants is, according to the homeowners, the main reason for the rent increase.
While RPG was able to invest four billion in the apartments from the rents taken in between 2005 and 2010, in the four years from 2011 to 2014 it is expected to be 5.2 billion.
On the large-format LCD display on the ceiling opposite the upholstered armchairs in the waiting room of Havířov, a few red glowing information appear in between.
"The rent increases in 2011 by 15% and less affect 31 200 apartments, that is, more than 90% of RPG's apartments."
"Always this means a maximum of 7.50 CZK per square meter per month," can be read on the LCD monitor.
Only with 400 apartments from RPG's portfolio, rent increases by 38 percent.
"In these cases, it is about the increase of extremely low rental prices of 19.66 CZK per square meter," argues RPG.
With 2600 apartments, the rent remains at the same level next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not skyrocket rents, but will take place gradually within four and eight years.
What more - the company imposes itself another obligation: All revenue from the rent increase (see chart) wants to put the company back in the apartments, especially in heat savings - into new windows and into the thermal insulation.
But - primarily, these are to benefit those people who sign the agreements on the rent increase.
The architects saw it - the office also has a kindergarten
The office building Avriopoint in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
But who would expect a mini kindergarten here, with everything that goes with it: colorful walls, creative furniture, a lot of toys and even a mini playground on the outdoor terrace.
This kindergarten has been available to the staff of Arch.Design since last year.
The design and architectural office Arch.Design, from whose studios a number of well-known Brno buildings come, calculated from the first designs for the new building Avriopoint with the premises for his company mini kindergarten.
In wise foresight, because most of his 90 employees (inside) are of the baby boom age and the company is concerned that the project managers and architects return to their workplace as soon as possible.
Along with the ability to work shortened, the kindergarten is another bonus that Arch.Design has to offer its employees in the concept of their social program.
The civil engineers and architects have made it easier to reconcile their demanding profession and child welfare.
The Minikindergarten is an original idea of the employees (inside) of Arch.Design and with the support of the management they succeeded in attracting funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs for their project.
The company mini-kindergarten is financed by the Human Resources and Employment Policy Operations Programme from the European Social Fund and from the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this financing (grants of 2, 8 million CZK) could be procured the necessary facilities and equipment and for a period of 2 years is provided for qualified personnel and for the operation.
After the use of the funding (2 years), the company Arch.Design is obliged to continue to operate the Minikindergarten for another 3 years at its own expense.
The preparation of this project took a whole year, with the company Economy Rating providing active assistance in the processing of applications.
The children are taken care of by fully qualified staff - a nurse and a kindergarten teacher, the kindergarten can be attended by children without age restrictions, although most of them are over three years old.
And since this is about a mini kindergarten, only 5 children are allowed to be present at the same time, but the day takes place over several children.
The kindergarten operation is flexibly adapted to the needs of the parents, the children of all employees have the same rights in terms of the use of the kindergarten - without regard to the company hierarchy and their respective position.
Although it is individual education and care, the program content in the mini kindergarten is nevertheless comparable to the supporting program of pre-school education.
The children not only play here, but above all they are offered excellent lessons - from basic findings to preschool lessons, they also learn English.
The classroom is not only equipped with toys and creative games, but also with a computer that is available to the children.
What more - the presence of young children in the company contributes to a friendly and positive company environment.
The parents can always take a look at the children and so the stress of the delayed pick-up of the children from a faraway kindergarten is eliminated.
Parents therefore use their working hours more productively.
No wonder that natural and loyal employer-employee relationships are also emerging here.
Arch.Design was thus among the Czech companies that offer clear benefits in the recruitment of new employees, which are family-friendly and strengthen their personnel marketing through such programs.
A bone house fascinates even after 100 years. Check out the interiors of Gaudi
The roof seems like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs like the spine of a dinosaur and the balconies are ripped-up fish mouths.
This is the Casa Batlló by the Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the local inhabitants, the house with its organic forms got the nickname "bone house".
Organic shapes, wild colors, the unusual use of stone, tile shards and mosaics, the facades reminiscent of scales and ubiquitous soft lines, all these are typical features of the Art Nouveau style by Antonio Gaudi.
The facade of the house plays with dreamlike lines, tender colors and textures reminiscent of nature and living things.
Only on closer inspection does one notice that everything is dominated by geometry, rhythm and well thought-out order.
At night, the whole façade looks even more plastic, dramatic and the special lighting enhances the shine of the colors.
The same sweeping lines and intertwined shapes also dominate the interior of the house.
Shaft-shaped wood copies the window frames, railings, decorative elements of doors, even peepholes and strips.
The house Batlló in the district of Eixample on the busy shopping street Passeig de Grácia No. 43 was created by the reconstruction of a house from 1877, which architect Emilio Sala Cortese carried out.
The reconstruction took two years and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, originally insisted on the demolition of the old and the construction of a completely new building, but ultimately he agreed to Gaudí's idea for an unusual and also cheaper conversion.
However, the Casa Batlló apartment building was not designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
He collaborated with the architect Josep Maria Jujol.
Especially on its drawing board, the decorations for the representative apartment of the owner of the real estate and also the use of mosaics on the facade was his idea.
However, numerous other artists also worked on the design of the façade.
The joint work on the designs for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful collaboration between Jujola and Gaudí.
Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudí's Casa Milá house in Park Güell, where other works by Antoni Gaudí are located.
Shortly after its completion, the house was given the nickname "bone house" by the local inhabitants of its organic forms.
Others, in turn, called it the "yawning house" because of the special window opening mechanism.
It is also said that the sword of St. George, the patron saint of Catalonia, is depicted at the very top of the building.
But other sculptural elements also symbolize hidden religious motifs.
Gaudí designed a unique central heating system for the house at that time with venting channels and typical fireplaces.
A little bizarrely, her 45-degree inclination already seems.
In his work, Gaudí consistently ignored all building regulations at that time and was by no means deterred by them.
Before construction began, he obtained the corresponding building permit from the city, but the information he provided about the planned reconstruction was so vague that the city fathers were so horrified by the result at the time of completion that they demanded a remedy.
The councillors also came across, among other things, that the construction with its pillars even intervened in the public sidewalk.
However, there were no more changes, on the contrary - only fifteen days after the request of the district in this regard, Josep Batlló submitted an application for the approval of the rental of the two highest floors of the house - and it was promptly granted to him.
The homeowner himself moved into the lower floors.
In the gallery in the 2. Stock was a company salon, on the third floor were the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry store.
The entire six-storey building passes through a staircase up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the conversion eliminated all right angles and straight lines and replaced them with curved and curved walls.
But Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of spaces.
The social part can be completely connected by opening the salon doors and so a larger society could comfortably chat without having to do without a certain intimacy in more confidential conversations.
In addition to a new facade, the house was given a rather unusual roof and two other floors by Gaudí’s conversion.
Also impressive is Gaudí's play with the light as well as the blue and white glazed tiles with which the courtyard is covered and the atriums.
The play of these two colors gives all floors of the house a maximum of light.
He simply used the principle that white reflects the light better than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb the sunlight.
The house Casa Batlló, which was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2005, can visit anyone today.
On the first floor, the most spacious and magnificent apartment is open to the public.
The homeowners decided only in the year to take this step and this on the occasion of the 150th birthday of the famous creator.
When it was found that this is quite a profitable business, the visits were retained, and they were also extended to other common and the attic rooms, including the roof terrace.
However, the price for the visit to the monument is not a cardboard stick, it is 16.50 euros, students, pensioners, groups and holders of tourist passes get 20 percent discount.
This amount exceeds the entrance fees to other Gaudí buildings in the city.
If you want to get to know the real atmosphere of the house with its dragon towers, you should try to make friends with one of the residents and visit him at home.
The right mattress and the right bed frame? Women have different desires than men
Not the greatest bed frame, but the quality of the lying surface - so mattress and rust make up the good bed.
However, these must complement each other harmoniously in order to meet the wishes of the specific user.
In the selection, many things play a role - the weight, the size, the state of health and last but not least the gender of the sleeper.
Just as important is the interior, in which the mattress and rust have to be subordinated.
Typical example?
In a weekend house where there is no regular heating, latex mattresses are not well suited, as they take much longer to "warm up."
In addition, they are significantly heavier than conventional polyurethane mattresses.
And - they should be turned regularly.
If they do not have enough venting channels in the core and are also lying on a solid plate, moisture accumulates: it is therefore not excluded that it forms under their mold.
Of course, the choice also plays a role in what you are used to.
Those who have been abroad for a long time, where very high mattresses with a soft layer are common, will be difficult to get used to a low mattress with a hard surface.
"Are probably all the hockey players who have come back from the NHL have complained to me that they can no longer sleep properly here."
"For their worn-out shoulders, heels and hips, they simply need a soft layer of visco foam (Memory Foam - a shape memory polymer)."
"I recommend these, among other things, to sugar-sick people who suffer from a disorder of the nervous system, so that they can poorly receive the "information" from the joints and the skin," explains Sylva Hadamcziková, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
That’s why I got many hockey players years ago, but also other customers, these mattresses with Visco foam (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no longer a problem, because such mattresses offer, among other things, the manufacturer Tempur, the Italian company Magniflex or the Czech manufacturer Tropico."
And you don't necessarily have to be a famous hockey player to appreciate the benefits of the Visco foam.
This "miracle" actually works quite simply.
The foam optimizes its hardness and shape according to the absorbed heat, in other words, it nestles on the warm body.
Nowhere does it press, at night you don't roll around like after a heavy fight.
You just sleep much better.
The viscoelastic foam also offers protection against decubitus (volume).
When choosing the size of the mattress, you should still add the length of the soles of the feet to the body size, so approx. 21 to 34 cm.
Man and woman who are about 180 cm tall need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each sleeper should have at least 90 cm lying width, together 180 cm.
For single beds, for example for singles, 120 to 140 cm are attached.
Half of the comfort and also for possible visitors.
Otherwise, the following rule of thumb applies to the ideal bed width: "If you lie on your back, there should still be enough space for the slightly angled arms," advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, the guild master of the upholsterers and interior decorators, who has devoted herself for years to the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and also presents this topic at technical schools.
With a double bed, everyone needs their own rust and their own mattress, but be careful when shopping so that the mattresses are the same.
Otherwise, there is nothing left but to mount the grates at different heights and this is not possible with every bed frame.
Foam mattresses should be at least 14 cm high, mattresses with feather skeleton 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters should be accounted for by the mould layer and the fine upholstery.
"By hand or when you sit down, you must not feel the feathers in any case," warns Helena Prokopová.
Each mattress requires a special type of rust.
Full-padded beds with mattress and underlayment such as mixed Siam twins have nothing to do in the bedroom.
These mattresses cannot be ventilated and you cannot wash the cover, which is already common today.
And since you lose between 0.2 to 0.75 l of sweat in a single night, it is clear that the mattress slowly becomes a huge (and clogged sieve) after five to seven years.
This is also why experts reject advertising slogans that promise a service life of up to 25 years, even a lifetime guarantee for mattresses.
Every thing has its ifs and buts.
And therefore a practical advice from the dealers: For mattresses of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not shy away from the hygiene of the washable, removable covers, but it is recommended to use a mattress protector, which can be easily peeled off and washed.
Even though today, mattress covers with all-round zipper are usually made, so that you get two halves after opening (immensely important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger mattresses, especially executed alone, often seems like the unequal battle between David and Goliath.
Do they have a solid plate in bed instead of a rust?
Get out of it!
Or at most for a bed for unloved guests and for a single night.
Even so, they should rather provide the plate with ventilation holes (if there are none in it) and mattresses with spring skeleton and 15 cm minimum height with so-called. Use pocket spring core and fine pads.
Polyurethane mattresses do not belong on such a base.
Latex or sandwich mattresses (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut) are suitable for non-adjustable slatted frames with 14 to 18 spring strips (if necessary also combinations of latex and coconut), always rusts with a larger number of slats, i.e. 28 and more spring strips, with lordosis support in the lumbar region and the possibility of regulating the slat hardness.
On adjustable slat grates, there are no mattresses with feather skeleton, as they do not respond to the ergonomic adjustment.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the spring strips, special flexible shoulder modules are also offered.
This is a special attachment of the spring strips, which makes it possible to press in the spring strips or even to angle them in such a way that they enable the shoulder of the sleeper to sink in a point.
Especially for men with broad shoulders an important thing.
There are even mattress manufacturers who have started to use soft zones for the shoulder area in "men's mattresses".
Also thought of the ladies - they are granted these soft zones in the hip area.
For the most demanding customers, point-elastic wing spring systems (Lattoflex) or grates with point-elastic contact pads with so-called Multitorsion suspension determined.
The pressure is spread over several points, which reduces the voltage.
But - if you use a bad (too large and full) pillow to the right mattress and right rust, most of the benefits are lost again.
Again, a rule of thumb: the pillow should support the head, its tips should only reach up to the shoulders so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
Therefore, a 50 x 60 cm cushion seems ideal, as the Scandinavians like.
In the side position, the pillow (together with the shoulder relief zone in the rust or the soft zone in the mattress) should compensate for the shoulder height.
Our modern mattresses have something in common with the former (filled with hay) straw bags.
Modern manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or at least their admixtures.
Even with mattresses, the new magic word is called "organic".
Instead of petroleum raw materials, natural oils are increasingly being used for the production of polyurethane foams - for example, castor and soybean oil.
Soy is used by all well-known manufacturers.
"For mattresses, organic means, which their core is made of materials of purely natural origin," explains Petr Vašíček from the company Tropico Plus.
Natural substances are also used in the production of mattress covers - one of the first was aloe vera.
But you can also treat yourself to microcapsules that spread fresh forest or lavender scent when you sleep.
Here, too, you make a difference between man and woman.
While the men use a "cooling" plant extract from birch leaves so that the mattress cover can absorb the heat and cool the body, the covers for women have "warming" effect.
Extracts of red peppers stimulate the blood circulation, so the weaker sex gets pleasantly warm when sleeping.
And today's favorites?
Mattresses made of cold foam (it has larger pores with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more breathable than commercially available polyurethane and also much more flexible).
The combination of the different stiffness (hardness) of cold foams and visco foams creates multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head, hip and heels are located.
For a high-quality mattress, however, you have 7000 crowns and more to rap.
However, health mattresses are usually burdened with lower VAT, as they are considered medical aids.
Gumotex was the first Czech company to have this advantage.
You can see saving on the mattress and on the rust is not so easy.
Every now and then there are special offers from manufacturers and dealers who offer two mattresses for the price of one.
The Magniflex brand offers the Duofreeze mattress with plaster-covered Visco foam memory for 11,990 CZK.
The second is free.
It was the material Tempur that ushered in the era of viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density at near cosmic tempo.
No wonder, they were developed for NASA, because the astronauts are exposed to enormous overloads during the launches.
Tempure becomes soft in heat, in a cool environment it solidifies again.
So it adapts perfectly to the human body and distributes the body pressure in an optimal way.
It is therefore not only ideal for preventing pressure fire, but generally increases the sleeping comfort.
Viscoelastic foams are not only used for mattresses, but also for other health products, such as special foot cushions, which should provide relief for the legs and the vessels.
Local manufacturers use, for example, the foams Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
More and more parents want people surveillance devices to have the kids under control
The fear for their own children is growing and so more and more parents are considering monitoring them via GPS.
The system, which was originally invented for the search for cars, can just as well locate people, which would also be helpful in such cases, as recently with the disappearance of nine-year-old Anička Janatková.
The device is currently about the size of a cigarette box, but soon it should not be bigger than a wristwatch.
Many people have terrified the fall of the missing Anička and so they are looking for means and ways to better protect their children.
Also for the price of an impairment of their privacy.
"We strive to tell everyone that this is not about spying around, but about an effective means of reducing the likelihood that tragedy will occur," says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of GPS tracking devices on the Czech market.
"I admit that it can come to the misuse of such devices on a case-by-case basis, for example, if you put it in someone's pocket without them knowing about it, but we have not had such a case so far."
"Most customers really buy it for security reasons," adds Pilin.
In his opinion, however, the child should always know what purpose the "box" serves and how to use it in an emergency.
However, child psychologist Dana Bočková points out that if a child does not like to wear such a thing, he simply gets rid of his.
"Even very young children show great creativity when it comes to losing certain things intentionally if they don't want to be controlled."
"The mobile phones already raised great expectations among the parents at first, but they can be switched off just as easily as these new monitoring devices," says Ms. Bočková.
In their opinion, it is also controversial whether such a facility actually helps in the event of an attack.
"In the case of planned abductions, the kidnapper practically always checks whether the child has any electronics with him that he could be located with."
"Today it's the phone."
"If such monitoring equipment found wider use, they would also seek it, as their sale would surely be accompanied by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the criminals are always one step ahead of the police," says the psychologist.
However, she admits that similar devices can be quite helpful in a sudden attack by a paedophile.
According to Roberta Čech of the company RC Monitoring, which offers location services for both automobiles and people, the existence of such a device can help even if it is destroyed immediately after the attack.
"The device can be set in such a way that it reports the respective position at certain intervals."
"Even if it were destroyed immediately, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"For more expensive devices, even an inclinometer is integrated, that is, if you fall down and remain motionless, the device immediately sends a warning, indicating the position," asserts Mr. Čech.
In his opinion, similar services could also do intelligent mobile phones with navigation, you only need to install a special software.
The problem of the current tracking devices is that this is either about matches of matchbox size, the pendants are similar or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk of losing them.
According to Mr. Pilin of the Macro Weil, therefore, devices that look like normal digital clocks are tested in the present.
"This has the advantage that the eventual attacker does not have to recognize at all that it is a surveillance or monitoring or Tracking device acts.
"Or he doesn't notice that until after some time, which gives the police a time lead," he adds.
No matter in which direction the development goes - to bracelets or trailers, the same technology is always used as in vehicle location.
So about the combination of location function using the GPS system (as well as in the navigation in the car) and the function of a mobile phone that reports the current position.
The army has so many fuses that you could wrap around the whole of the Czech Republic but only two years
The Czech army has bought 445 kilometers of ignition cords, detonated with explosive devices.
The year before, the Ministry of Defense had already delivered 224 kilometers of ignition cord to the army camps.
It is already reassuring to know that the armed forces have taken care of for 225 years.
The problem is only the durability of the ignition cords - two, but at most four years.
The army bought the fuses from the joint stock company STV Group, a. s. for a lappish 40 million crowns.
In his reasoning for purchasing this enormous amount of ignition cord, the General Staff MF DNES replied that the soldiers would consume about 60 kilometers of ignition cord annually.
According to the research of army pyrotechnicians, which MF DNES referred to, this statement shows that the whole army would have to undergo extremely intensive pyrotechnic training every year - from all generals and officers of the army command, to the secretaries and cleaning women.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and Army General Vlastimil Picek not exempt.
Only in this way could the considerable annual consumption of sixty kilometres of ignition cords be reasonably justified.
This length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But even so, these army stocks would last for more than ten years.
However, if the old rule of experts still applies that two meters of ignition line are completely sufficient for the training of each new professional soldier, then the army has created a reassuring stock for the already mentioned 225 years through these new purchases - also from the point of view of the increased demand of the pioneer and special forces.
In the process, soldiers of the rapid-use brigade recently complained to the Minister of Defense Vondra that they had almost no more cartridges for handguns, so that shooting exercises of the missing means are severely restricted because of.
Not to mention the lack of underpants.
"I don't think about why they buy such tons of ignition cords from us either."
But that’s ultimately their decision, they’ll know what they need them to do.”
"For us, the army is a good customer, which we as a dealer would like to meet to the greatest possible extent," says the sales manager of the STV Group Jan Děcký.
Jan Pejšek, the spokesman for the Ministry of Defense, justifies the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of ignition line by the fact that the army had thus covered itself with this "ammunition" for at least ten years.
However, Jan Děcký of the STV Group speaks only of a four-year service life of the ignition cords and police and army pyrotechnicians only of two years.
"With perfect storage, the four years mentioned are probably also possible," admits one of them, who, however, wants to remain unnamed, so as not to be accused of criticism of the army as a soldier.
After the end of the service life, any ammunition must be thoroughly tested, whether it is still reliable and does not endanger the lives of the soldiers.
These tests are not for nothing, but cost further money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defense is the volume discount for the 445 kilometers of ignition cord.
"They cost us sixty percent less than last year's delivery of 244 kilometers," spokesman Pejšek tells us the point of view of the purchasers of the Ministry of Defense.
Just for comparison: The annual consumption of ignition cords of police pyrotechnicians, which liquidate ammunition from the Second World War or the Soviet Brother Army, has barely exceeded 1,500 meters for several years.
And the police always order only such quantities of this ammunition, which it can consume before the end of the service life.
Because of the safety of the pyrotechnicians, in addition, the possibility of flexible purchases of more modern and thus also reliable ignition cords is kept open.
The Ministry of Defense has huge problems with the liquidation of tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Treaty, when the two hundred thousand-headed Czechoslovak People's Army was preparing for its campaign to the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnicians, who addressed MF DNES, the Czech armed forces expect the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometers of old fuses in a few years, which it has so "cheaply" bought today.
To this day, I have the contacts that I have won thanks to the competition
The victorious placement in the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition has helped Lukáš Pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the last vintage of the "Small Entrepreneur of the Year" competition was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success seems like a film scenario.
Lukáš Pytloun liked to travel.
It was only abroad that he became aware that there was a lack of good accommodation options in Liberec at reasonable prices.
From the savings from his holiday work abroad and with the help of a bank loan, he bought a dilapidated house with five apartments.
Considering that he was a university student in his sixth semester at the time, this was certainly a courageous undertaking.
"The price-quality ratio at the time annoyed me and so I tried to do something about it," says Lukáš Pytloun.
He rented the first reconstructed apartment to foreign workers.
He immediately invested all the profit back in the house, which he then converted step by step to the pension with 54 beds.
Since then, in just seven years of entrepreneurial activity in Liberec, he has managed to open four guesthouses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was the four-star hotel "Pytloun Design Hotel" until recently.
This year, another first-class hotel was added.
"We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept and other interested parties in the franchise of the Pytloun hotels have already registered," says the entrepreneur number one from last year.
"Big part of this license sale to operate hotels just had the victory in the "Entrepreneur of the Year" competition," adds Mr. Pytloun appreciatively.
The victory has earned him greater notoriety, even popularity in Liberec and the surrounding area.
"People recognized me on the street, often they even congratulated me afterwards and I have to say, that did really well," he recalls.
I really recommend to all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don’t have to win right away, every visualisation is good.
He says that he still benefits from the contacts and acquaintances that would not have happened at all.
"With some people I've met thanks to the competition, I'm still having regular business relationships to this day."
In his opinion, the fame associated with success is also a little reflected in each of his employees.
And there he has to the seventy.
"I notice with them greater loyalty and pride that they are part of something that is given universal recognition."
I don’t just see this as a personal success, no, that’s the result of the good work of all of us.”
"My name has only come to the fore," says Lukáš Pytloun modestly.
I wish my successors a quieter year than we had in Farmet
The euphoria of victory was quickly replaced by the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to its determination, Farmet has the worst behind it.
Karel Žďárský, the company owner of Farmet, accepted the prize for the first rank of the Vodafone Company of the Year competition last year.
At the time, the jury paid tribute to the efforts with which he stamped out a company from the small tool shop in Česká Skalice that generates hundreds of millions in sales.
"I can say that this appreciation has encouraged not only myself, but also all my employees and strengthened our self-confidence in the fight with competition," says the last year's winner.
At the beginning of Farmet's company history, there was an effort to do something useful.
And when the state offered his father Karel Žďárský a small workshop for the lease as compensation for the property seized by the communists, he did not hesitate for long, let his career in the company in which he was employed until then, and founded his own company for the production of plastic tubs with a few comrades of his father.
A short time later, they began to focus on vegetable oil presses.
Within 18 years, they have become the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in all of Central Europe.
But it was only through the success in the aforementioned competition and its medialization that it also entered into the consciousness of the non-specialist public.
"Not only that our customers now perceive the Farmet brand much more intensively, our foreign partners also began to work with a company that has achieved the greatest possible success in their country to attach greater value," says Karel Žďárský.
Last year, however, was not only in the sign of victory euphoria at Farmet.
The assessment was based on the company's economic results in 2008 and part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for the sale of tool manufacturing products.
The crisis, which at that time shook even less the citizens, but above all companies, just reached its peak - many companies were forced to stop their investment projects and restrict the purchase of new facilities and technologies.
"Of course we could not escape this situation."
"Sales declined by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even resort to redundancies," explains Karel Žďárský
A viable company sometimes has to take such unpopular measures.
However, it was possible to get a grip on the situation and keep the company in the black, even if with lower profits than before the crisis.
At one, the company was unwilling to make smears - in investment in research and development.
"From the grant, we built a research and training center, we strengthened our presentation at international trade fairs and earned main prizes at domestic exhibitions," says Žďárský.
Everything testifies to the fact that we have overcome the crisis.
Sales are growing again and with them the number of new employees.
"I wish the new winner a lot of joy in the victory - but in a calmer atmosphere," says Karel Žďárský.
An opinion poll that cleans up with nonsensical regulations
The opinion poll surrounding the "absurdity of the year" is part of the entrepreneurial competition for the fourth time.
Some nonsensical regulations have already managed to get out of the world.
The dubious winner of the next vintage of the opinion poll "Absurdity of the Year" became the duty to create documents on authorities that are available online.
So more than a third of not quite four thousand voting entrepreneurs decided.
Thus, the Social Security Administration demanded a paper extract from the commercial register, even if the official could have retrieved it by two mouse clicks.
Thanks to the opinion poll, this is now changing.
"In the future, the Czech Social Insurance Administration will no longer require extracts from the commercial register when checks by social security payers," the spokeswoman for ČSSZ Laja Buraňová said.
The purpose of the opinion survey "Absurdity of the Year" is to examine all regulations and orders that entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic have to fulfil and to repeal the nonsensical.
This year, for the fourth time, it is part of an entrepreneurship competition, which is held by the ch. Business newspaper (HN) is held and enjoys growing popularity among the public.
If the three thousand people took part in the vote last year, there were already four thousand this year.
No wonder, because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve solely to hinder corporate activity.
"For example, as far as the number of income tax forms is concerned, we are taking a leading position in the world," notes Karel Havlíček of the Association of Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises and Tradesmen of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of entrepreneurial activity in recent years has been the proclaimed goal of all governments.
Compared to the world, however, the situation in the Czech Republic has hardly improved.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic has the 74 in terms of terms of business. Rank in, compared to the previous year an eight-placed position worse.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first proclaimed in the year and takes place every year according to the same scenario.
Anyone can report administrative and bureaucratic nonsense from April until the end of the competition at the end of September.
The web address www.firmaru.cz. After that, the organizer of the competition selects seven candidates for the "Antipreis" and lets the public vote on the websites www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz via the Internet.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
More than a hundred, more specifically 105 pointless regulations and orders have already been registered for this year’s opinion poll.
The tips come not only from entrepreneurs, but also from professional associations and journalists.
Among the nominated "finalists" of the competition are, for example, provisions that maintenance vehicles for highways and expressways have to pay tolls or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets have to prepare every two years.
The list of this year's "Seven" is published on the pages of the competition.
The proclamation of the competition at the beginning of November in Prague’s Wenceslas Square is part of a happening, which is also regularly attended by political and public figures.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the director of the association of small or medium-sized companies and tradesmen, were the Tsch. Republic and Petr Kužel, the President of the Chamber of Commerce of the Ch. Republic at the culmination of the competition with the game.
"Where the state throws clubs between the entrepreneurs' legs, there can be no real economic upswing, so it is my goal to repeal at least thirty paragraphs every year, which today still unnecessarily complicate entrepreneurs to do their ventures," Martin Kocourek, the minister for industry and commerce, said in a statement.
Efforts to remove nonsensical orders from the world are having an effect.
In 2007, people most disturbed the entrepreneur-imposed duty to report to the trade office at the site of their permanent permanent establishment three days in advance the intention to drive to an exhibition or fair with an exhibition stand.
This obligation was revoked by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The obligation, which received the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employment office business trips of employees in the amount of up to 30 days - was passed by the law on them so-called. "Green card" abolished.
And - all good things are three:
At the absurdity of 2009, the ordinance was chosen, which imposed on physiotherapists to have a mirror, a refrigerator and two personal scales in the consultation room.
This regulation was somewhat softened by the Ministry of Health this year - the refrigerator requirement fell away.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, educational or sports projects
A novelty in this year's fifth year of the competition of the business newspaper (HN) is the category "Responsibility-conscious company of the year 2010".
The basic idea of this competition is to promote sensible and fair undertakings.
"We want to support companies that are aware of the consequences of their entrepreneurial activities on the environment and support socially responsible initiatives," says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the mobile phone company Vodafon, who is the exclamator and guarantor of this competition, as well as the "Rebel of the Year" competition.
For this year’s first year of this special subcategory of the main Vodafon Company of the Year competition, companies registered for which success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspiring and offers enough material for a self-employed article.
Although they differ diametrically in relation to the subject of their activities, their efforts nevertheless have a common denominator - support and consideration.
This is about handicapped people, for example, because about personal problems or the health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Czech Republic, for example, the Prague-based software company Et Netera, which promotes the creation of non-formal sports teams among its employees, who then participate in numerous tournaments in various sports.
Another example of a responsible company from the Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main sponsor of a foundation fund for handicapped children for seventeen years.
A paper mill from Poděbrady also takes good care of its health-disabled employees, who make up 70 percent of their workforce, for which it was honored with the title "Responsible company of the Central Bohemian Region"; in the Vodafone Company of the Year competition, it ranked third in this region.
In the Olomouc region, the accounting firm MiRyz Soft won, which introduced a fluent and also reduced to an average of 35 hours per week, and this without a proportionate wage reduction.
The jury also paid tribute to the fact that the company mainly buys from Czech manufacturers, supports citizens’ initiatives in their surroundings and works according to environmentally friendly principles.
"We strive to recycle as much as possible in order to minimise the impact of our entrepreneurial activities and administration on the environment," explains her managing director Miluše Ryznarová.
The responsible IT company Enlogit from the Ústí nad Labem region, in turn, is interested in the health of its employees and therefore it has purchased ergonomic armchairs and keyboards for all notebooks, it also promotes home working for its employees and in company promotions it uses cartering services offered by a home-protected workshop.
"In addition, we support the "People in Need" foundation, which provides concrete assistance to the local Roma community," says Ondřej Suchý, the company's representative.
Last but not least, the activity of the cleaning company "Praní a čištění" from the Karlovy Vary region is worth mentioning, which contributes its employees to their pension insurance in the form of extra bonuses.
"We grant our employees contributions to the food, the commute, the increase in their qualifications and for the holiday," says Josef Strapáč from the construction company Czasch from Bruntál, the winner in the Moravian-Silesian region.
All district finalists of the Vodafon Company of the Year competition were automatically registered for the category Responsible Company of the Year, which answered the questions of the questionnaire enclosed with the registration and sent it to the organizer by 15 August at the latest.
Incorrectly or incomplete completed answers in the questionnaire were excluded from the evaluation by the organizer.
"If the representatives of the competing companies left the questions unanswered, they were excluded from the "Responsibility-Conscious Company of the Year" competition, but in the main competition Vodafone Company of the Year they were not disqualified."
"A separate registration only for this competition is not possible, since it is only a subcategory of the main competition company of the year," explains Karel Goldman of the organizing agency Bison & Rose.
Pilsner Bodenfonds - Arrests of the police in a public tender
In the building of the Bodenfonds in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police made arrests in recent days.
The local media entrepreneur and real estate dealer Luboš G. was taken away by the detectives in handcuffs.
He had allegedly tried to manipulate a just-held public competition for the settlement of restitution claims in such a way that the land offered in the competition was a concrete interested party.
He is said to have paid Luboš G. half a million for this.
"At this time, I can only confirm that the police are prosecuting a person for the offense of fraudulent machinations in a public competition," Antonie Zelená, the head of the Pilsner prosecutor's office told the newspaper "Právo" that she could not provide further details with regard to the ongoing investigations.
24 hours later, the 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by police.
In view of the sparse official information, one can only speculate on how he was able to manipulate the public competition.
The spokeswoman for the Lubomír Černá Land Fund stated on Právo’s question that the police had actually arrested the Pilsner subsidiary of the Land Fund during a public competition.
"It was about a client and by no means about one of our employees," she concretized.
According to Ms Černá, public competition had the correct name "invitation to tender claims for the transfer of land in accordance with the Land Act" and would take place in cases where several applicants show interest in the land offered.
"These persons, in the context of the request, offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be paid by the transfer than the declared land value."
"According to the claims offered, the order of the potential acquirers is determined, then the land fund transfers the land to the person with the highest offer," explains the fund's spokeswoman.
Luboš G. was obviously available information on who had registered at the request and since he himself was an authorized person, since he had bought himself a number of restitution claims, he offered a land interest that he withdraw from the competition.
Obviously against a fat severance.
That would also be a sufficient explanation for why he had such a large amount of money with him when he was arrested.
Luboš G. has had too good contacts with the Pilsner Bodenfonds in the past.
So he also played a role in the case of the former head of the land fund Václav Sankota, who was prosecuted for issuing land in replacement restitutions, to which location decisions had already been made on construction projects.
At that time, Luboš G. from the Land Fund, for example, also acquired land intended for the construction of public roads, more precisely, at the place where the construction of the access magistral to the Borské pole industrial park was planned.
Later, he exchanged these very favorably with the magistrate for a house directly in the historic center of the city, which far exceeded the value of the plots.
At that time, the town hall had to give small things with a heavy heart in order not to endanger the construction project by blocking the plots.
Household housing costs are rising by a few hundred monthly
From January, households will not only have to expect higher costs for all types of energy, but also higher water and sewage charges and for district heating and in some places, rents will also grow.
Families will have to pull several hundred more crowns from the wallet every month from January than before.
Electricity will be up to 4.6 percent more expensive, gas by 2 percent and more, in some cities you will have to pay up to a tenth more for water deliveries and in some places district heating will also be more expensive.
Electricity price alone costs housing households a few hundred more crowns each year.
The high-current prices were reduced by all the main suppliers, so the decisive charge of electricity generation from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic systems, is to blame.
Although gas only becomes moderately more expensive, this is exactly when people have to heat the most and have the highest consumption.
Here, too, a few hundred crowns more per year is to be expected.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive throughout the Czech Republic, the prices of district heating vary from city to city.
Larger locations in particular are planning price increases.
For example, from January, households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové will have to pay up to 50 more kronor per month for district heating, with more than 1000 crowns more per year paying families in Liberec.
The residents of Prague, in turn, face 9 percent higher water and sewage charges, and this in the event that the city increases infrastructure rent.
If the rent doesn't change, it's only 6.8 percent.
However, the price in Prague is still among the lowest compared to the whole of the Czech Republic.
In northern Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, water and sewage charges are expected to rise by 7.4 percent.
Enormous rent increases are to be expected, for example, in 140,000 rental apartments, for which the so-called from January. Rent regulation is omitted.
For example, the housing company CPI Byty, which owns 2500 apartments in Ústí nad Labem, plans to increase rents by a hundred percent from January.
Anyone who does not agree with this rent increase, the company wants to prosecute it in court.
The regulated rents, which are still paid in nearly 300,000 apartments today, are expected to rise by more than 10 percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and rum beer is out - it just seems too slow
Fernet, rum and vodka, for once a good whisky, which you have stolen from the father from the house bar.
These are the drinks after which drunken Czech teenagers under fifteen most often have to be treated emergency.
No exception are children who have to sleep in their hangover repeatedly in the hospital.
This is evident from the experiences of doctors who face similar cases in the admission of the children's departments of clinics.
"Beer or wine are completely out of fashion because it just takes too long to get drunk."
"Today's trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Luděk Pelikán, the pediatric department's chief physician at the central Bohemian hospital in Hořovice.
"Whisky, if it is possible to steal a bottle from the father's house bar, and if not, then at least Fernet or vodka.
"Vodka has the advantage that you can mix him with Juice, then he doesn't smell so strong," explains the chief medical officer.
The spokeswoman of the Faculty Hospital Motol Eva Jurinová agrees with him.
"The most common is Fernet or rum."
"That's today's alcohol trend, especially at primary schools."
"Occasionally it was also about Slibowitz, who you take from home," Ms. Jurinová said.
According to chief physician Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers are no exception in the hospital reception.
In front of the clinic in Hořovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for ten years in the pediatric department of the hospital Motol, where the ambulances delivered drunken students from near and far.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"She began her career at the age of 12, when she was first admitted with 3.5 per million alcohol in her blood and also in combination with "extase,"" the doctor described a particularly severe case.
"She was at some dance party at the exhibition site in Holešovice."
"The interesting thing was that it didn't seem strange to her mother that her daughter didn't come home for 48 hours," the chief medical officer wonders.
Especially the lack of interest of the parents or their incredible tolerance in the inauguration with their own offspring is considered one of the main causes of the growing alcoholism of children.
According to experts, children are not concerned with genuine dependence in the true sense of the word.
"Alcoholism is a long-standing chronic dependence on alcohol and all related phenomena and this is not the case with these children."
Among those who repeatedly enjoy alcohol, a negative family-social background is usually characteristic," explains chief physician Pelikán.
According to Ms. Jurinová, the spokeswoman of the hospital Motol, about forty drunken children were admitted to the local department of pediatric and adolescent medicine by mid-November.
However, only the cases of severe alcohol poisoning, which required hospitalization, go into the statistics.
Drunk children who are brought home by parents or, if necessary, by the police after outpatient treatment will not be registered.
In addition to the cases in which children drink only a bottle of liquor in the school bench, according to Mr. Pelikán, there are three seasonal amplitudes, which can be relied on one hundred percent: Walpurgisnacht, New Year's Eve and the end of the school year.
"The latter for two reasons - either out of grief because of the bad testimony or for the joy of the holidays."
"On Walpurgis night, I have also experienced seven drunken children in the recording at once," emphasizes Doctor Pelikán.
A drunk child who spends the night under medical supervision is paradoxically better off than a child who struggles only with an unpleasant hangover the next day.
The headache in the morning after, which stems from dehydration and glucose deficiency, can be expelled in the hospital with a liquid-giving infusion with glucose and nutrients that the organism lacks.
"They are clearly better off, because after the "glorious" experience in the evening, they wake up in a good mood without anything hurting anywhere."
"They are just a little confused about where they are," admits Doctor Pelikán, sometimes spoiling the patient's good mood at least by enumerating the costs she will cost the treatment.
Because the transport by ambulance and the night in an acute bed come well and gladly on a few tens of thousands of crowns.
"Every now and then I used this as a means of education, when I directly calculated to the children at the visit, what their drunkenness cost and that it can happen that they have to work all the holidays to earn the money for a single such fete," added Doctor Pelikán.
In his opinion, however, the health insurance companies do not resort to recourse proceedings in order to demand the costs necessary to cure the drunken children from the parents.
Two training aircraft L-159 in foreign hands for the first time - in Spain
Two light fighter jets L-159 out of a total of five, which the Czech Ministry of Defense has exchanged for the Casa C-295M transport aircraft, flew to the Spanish city of Seville on Tuesday, where the Spanish aircraft manufacturer Casa - EADS is settling.
It is the first time that machines of this type have been in possession of a foreign army.
So far, they have only been seen abroad at maneuvers or air shows.
It is about the flightable two-seater version L-159T1, which was operated by the Czech army.
The remaining three aircraft are single-seater L-159.
These are currently still preserved in the Aero Vodochody, the intermediary of this business - the company Omnipol - took it over last week.
When she physically expedites the planes from Vodochody is not yet known to Jan Pejšek, according to the Ministry of Defense spokesman.
The single-seat L-159 fighter aircraft, in turn, were separated from long-term aircraft without further deposits and investment from the ministry department.
"The double-seat L-159T1 were replaced in current condition and appearance," Pejšek told the Právo newspaper.
He added that the army would not have to do without two-seater warplanes, as the Defense Department signed a 200 million contract with Aero Vodochody in May 2009 over the conversion of four superfluous L-159s to the two-seat version.
A new plane took over the army in July, the second wants to take it over by the end of this year.
According to Pejšek, EADS has committed to enforcing the warplanes into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"The treaty clearly states that the company is EADS customer of the L-159 aircraft and that they should serve to train pilots of the NATO countries.
"It is therefore up to the customer how he realizes the matter," Pejšek said.
The business newspaper (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish government has no interest in the L-159.
The barter of five L-159 for a transport aircraft Casa and the purchase of further aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns had been approved by the government of Mirek Topolánek last year.
At the time, the Ministry of Defence had not tendered for the purchase, but addressed EADS directly.
The defense office at the time argued that this exchange would support the future export of the L-159 abroad.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines, of which it only uses 24, the rest of which it wanted to divest.
By the way, the purchase of the planes Casa should also have a judicial aftermath.
The European Commission sued the Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice. The reason? It should have chosen the aircraft due to a whole-European tender and by no means by addressing a single manufacturer.
The army has already taken over three aircraft Casa, the last one is to land at Kbely Airport within fourteen days.
A longer index finger than ring finger means a lower risk of developing cancer
Men whose index finger is longer than the ring finger are obviously at a lower risk of developing prostate cancer.
That's the surprising finding of a study published Wednesday by the British Journal of Cancer.
This is due to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
"Our results show that the relative length of the fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostate cancer, and this in particular in men to sixty," explained the study's co-author, Ros Eeles, a professor at the Cancer Research Institute at the University of Warwick.
The finger could thus help determine which men should necessarily undergo a prostate cancer test, especially if there are genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health burdens, Ms Eeles added.
In the period from 1994-2009, she followed more than 1500 patients with prostate cancer with her colleagues in Britain, but at the same time 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the participants in the study, the index finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men, the same probability of prostate cancer was as for 19 percent of those men whose ring and index fingers were the same.
However, in men whose index finger was longer than the ring finger, this risk decreased by 33 percent, for men to sixty even by 87 percent.
The ratio of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which form in prenatal age, obviously reflects the different levels of sex hormones to which the child was exposed in the uterus.
Less testosterone is equivalent to a longer index finger.
Previous research has shown that testosterone in particular accelerates the growth of prostate cancer.
Václav Pačes, a leading Czech geneticist and former chair of the Academy of Sciences, told ČTK that he was fleetingly aware of this study, but that he did not consider the relationship between finger length and cancer risk to be "completely proven" so far.
Czech Republic in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Just like most of Europe, the Czech Republic is also lying under a blanket of snow on Thursday morning.
On the roads and sidewalks there is mostly stuck snow, the winter servicers were in many places all night on the road.
The D5 motorway between kilometres 89 and 90 in the direction of Rozvadov is closed due to some accidents caused by trucks and passenger cars and the D1 at Brno in the direction of Prague is also "standing".
Novinky.CZ told the dispatcher of the Central Auto-Moto Club (ÚAMK).
At kilometer 91, a truck crashed, at kilometer 93 two trucks collided, in this accident there are injured.
There are also a few cars in the road ditch.
There are also problems at kilometer 185 of the D1 motorway in the direction of Prague.
Here, too, two trucks collided.
The drivers should leave right behind Brno at kilometer 190 or drive over Brno and drive up at kilometer 182 at the town of Kývalka.
This is where miles of traffic jams form.
Also on the D11 an accident happened and that right on the driveway to Prague.
In Prague itself lies a snow cover several centimeters thick and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
Motor photo columns, for example, are formed in the district of Prosek, and the Štěrboholská road is also completely clogged.
The safest means of transport is definitely the metro.
The trams run with delays, for example on the line between Karlsplatz and Friedensplatz.
At eight o'clock in the morning, the Prague crisis team meets.
There are also problems with the railway and on the airfield.
The Czech State Railways had to cancel seven express train connections due to snowdrifts.
There are problems, for example, on the route Prague - Kralupy or Prague - Beroun.
Travellers should definitely inform themselves about the current situation.
Ruzyně Airport is closed until 5 a.m. since Wednesday 11 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravia are only passable with increased caution.
Around Vyškov three side roads are completely unpassable, in the vicinity of Brno snow drifts form in places and in the vicinity of Blansko you are forced to use snow blowers on some higher roads.
One of the most affected areas is Výškov.
There are three roads still completely closed: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and also Šaratice - Milešovice.
Here, too, snow blowers will have to be used for snow removal.
When they will become passable again cannot be estimated until now.
In the Hodonín region, caution is needed in the White Carpathian territory.
On the roads, which may only be scattered with inert scattering agents for nature conservation reasons, lies a snow cover up to five centimeters thick, ČTK said.
In the Czech Republic, fresh snow fell from two to ten centimeters, most of which fell in northern Bohemia - sometimes up to 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, up to 15 centimeters of fresh snow fell.
In the Czech Republic, however, it slowly ceases to snow.
American soldiers have a new "smart weapon."
The American troops have used a new "smart" weapon in Afghanistan for the first time, which is so far only known as XM-25.
The generals hope that this new automatic weapon will affect the conflict with the Taliban there and shift the balance of power in their favor.
The new weapon is something like a super-precise cannon.
Their projectiles are directed to the target by laser with an accuracy of only a few meters.
The special projectiles of caliber 25 mm, which were developed for this rifle and contain highly explosive explosives, work practically like small grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode not only on impact with the target, but at any point in their ballistic trajectory.
That is, you can use them against an enemy who hides behind an obstacle - a wall or in the trench.
From above, he is usually not protected, so the murderous steel shard rain from above can easily put him out of action.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new combat rifle is the first infantry weapon to take advantage of "smart" technologies.
"The soldier basically proceeds like this: he targets the target and sends out a laser beam that determines the distance, so he gains an exact visor point, after which he corrects the elevation angle, then he only needs to push off.
“Let’s say you measured 543 m.”
"When you push off, the gun recharges and shoots the projectile at the distance of 543 meters plus minus one, two or three meters.
400 jobs are being relocated
The Fujitsu Group is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move their workplace from the previous office building on Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese group Fujitsu is relocating its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As the industry giant, which specializes in computer and its maintenance, announced on Wednesday, 400 women and men will move their workplace from the previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park in July next year, which is a large office complex on Lyoner Straße in the Frankfurt district of Niederrad.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, another 100 jobs of the Group should be accommodated there, which are so far distributed to the region.
The rental offer was extremely attractive, and the open-plan offices in Astro Park would also be better able to accommodate the working methods of the employees.
In Bad Homburg, too, Fujitsu had only been tenants.
The managing director in charge, Bernd Wagner, said, "with Frankfurt-Niederrad, we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The excellent connection to the airport is of great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The recent relocation of an important company within the region yesterday provoked joy in the winners and disappointment among the losers.
The Frankfurt economic department Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "global player" had been won again.
This is a “great commitment to location.”
Fujitsu fits the city, the settlement is an important impulse for Niederrad.
The mayor of Bad Homburg, Michael Korwisi (The Greens), regretted the decision of Fujitsu.
The city was informed early by the management about the intention.
"We have, of course, offered our help to the company," Korwisi said.
However, the friendly contacts could not have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with the landlord of the property at Marienbader Platz.
Ultimately, economic reasons would have been decisive.
Now it is a question of preventing a long vacancy in such a prominent place.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building shows up cooperatively."
The house previously used by Fujitsu on the Rathausplatz and the neighboring "Little Vertical" were one of the most controversial construction projects in the spa town ten years ago with the other buildings on Marienbader Platz.
As a joint project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was created between the station and the town hall, which caused criticism both because of the massive development of the areas previously used as a parking space and the height of the buildings.
In 2001, the investment advisory and rating company Feri, the software manufacturer for travel sales systems, Start Amadeus, and the computer manufacturer Fujitsu, which was still connected to Siemens at the time, moved into the houses.
The building used by Fujitsu was acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid a year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu-Konuzer describes itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
For example, it provides companies with computers and servers and also provides the necessary service.
The branch in the Rhine-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has far more employees in Munich.
From Bad Homburg, the subsidiary Fujitsu Technology Solutions is moving into Frankfurt-Niederrad, the other subsidiaries at this location are to be Fujitsu Services and a company called TDS.
For this purpose, 7000 square meters were rented in the office building Astro Park.
In the twenty-year-old complex - the name alludes to its star-shaped floor plan - the Central Association of Electrical Engineering and Electronics Industry, among others, is based.
Amazon suspends server - threats against Assange
WikiLeaks is increasingly in distress.
Internet service provider Amazon has banned the disclosure platform from its servers.
There may be political pressure behind it after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic cables.
Wikileaks founder Assange is reportedly in England.
The disclosure platform Wikileaks is coming under increasing fire in the United States.
The Internet activists lost access to their previous American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman, meanwhile, called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
And Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol's manhunt lists, is said to be staying in the UK, according to a newspaper report.
"Replaces WikiLeaks from Amazon Server."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the revealing activists announced via short message service Twitter on Wednesday (local time).
Shortly before, the Internet company Amazon had banned the Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The Internet activists had resorted to the Amazon Web Service (AWS) when publishing the secret diplomatic cables in order to cope with the high access numbers to the documents.
WikiLeaks tweeted, “Great – our dollars are now being spent to keep people in Europe busy.”
If Amazon has such problems with freedom of speech, "they should stop selling books."
Amazon stopped the use of its servers by WikiLeaks after employees of Senator Joe Lieberman had investigated, the television station CNN reported, citing the office of Lieberman.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British "Guardian" reported.
"I would have wished Amazon would take this measure earlier in light of the previous releases of classified information by Wikileaks," the senator said.
Lieberman, meanwhile, called for the platform to be denied use to servers in other countries.
"Wikileaks' illegal, egregious and reckless approach is putting our national security at risk and endangering lives around the globe," the non-party senator said in a statement.
"No responsible company -- whether American or foreign -- should help Wikileaks in its efforts to spread stolen material."
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted by authorities in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol's wanted list.
According to a report by London's The Independent newspaper, the 39-year-old Australian is staying in the UK, with the exact location known to Scotland Yard.
The Internet activist has always described the investigation in Sweden as intrigue of his opponents.
Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London there had been threats.
"There have even been calls for a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why Assange rightly fears for his safety, Hrafnsson said.
The WikiLeaks founder will therefore continue to hide.
Hrafnsson apparently responded to statements from North America.
In America, former Arkansas Republican governor Mike Huckabee had demanded that the person in charge of the Wikileaks revelations be charged and executed for treason.
In Canada, an adviser to Prime Minister Stephen Harper - obviously ironically - said on television that Assange should be "killed" and Obama could "use a drone."
Between the White House and Assange, meanwhile, a blow exchange flared up.
American President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, called it "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange had demanded the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in case she is responsible for recently announced spying calls on diplomats.
"I'm not quite sure we care about a guy's opinion with a website," Gibbs said.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far more significant than its one website."
The American government is now putting the protection of its databases to the full scrutiny.
As a special representative, the vice-director of the Center for Counterterrorism Measures, Russell Travers, was appointed, the White House said.
Travers is responsible for developing "necessary structural reforms" that have become necessary after Wikileaks have been disclosed in the message reports.
The White House also wants to have the ways the entire administration exchanges and protects information.
The American government also announced that it would ensure the security of dissidents and the most active, should it be in danger through the WikiLeaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to get in touch with them," Foreign Ministry spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We stand ready to protect them if that should become necessary."
The Ice University
At the "Gelato University" near Bologna, ice cream pastry chefs are prepared for better seasons.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
From the gelating and the gelataio.
The gelatte, in German somewhat ancient the ice cream confectioner, produces the cream according to all the rules of Italian ice creammaking.
The Gelataio takes the ice cream out of the refrigerated counter with a spatula, swipes it into the waffle and then sells it.
To know this, you don't have to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice, you can't miss the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The ice-cream university established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003, so that the ice cream from its machines everywhere meets the high Italian ideals.
The three-day basic course for future gelatieri has the largest inflow and visitors from all over the world.
But there are also several days of special courses around chocolate ice cream and internships in the in-house ice cream parlor.
Some people dream of a new career in the midlife crisis, others just venture on the smooth ice of their vague longings.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents - from Brazil to Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, an art teacher from California, loves the slow-food movement and wants to offer a European quality product in the country of the industrial ice cream in the future.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to bag something of his own after years in a nerve-racking job.
Two young Egyptian women dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and one from Brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and the Canadian housewife Julia comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro-Gelatiere Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect ice cream to the participants.
The decisive factor is not only good taste, but also the silky suppleness and the good consistency.
Luciano does not forget the icing on the icing on the cake of the national and even southern superstructure: "Italian gelato is simply the best - and then there is still a lot of romance."
The first step to production seems simple.
Luciano dumps the basic ingredients of milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers into a large mixing device, which with an electronic program heats everything to 85 degrees and then immediately cools down to four degrees.
Then he turns on a tap on the machine, and out comes a pasteurized white base cream, foundation for all milk ice creams.
Immediately, the lecturer is stormed with questions: Can ice cream only be made with natural substances without a stabilizer?
How can you let your own experimentation run wild?
Luciano warns against being misled by the zeitgeist.
If you talk about ice cream "only from natural ingredients", you may still have used stabilizers - usually a natural product, such as guar flour from the guar bean.
Of course, you can also make ice cream without a stabilizer, only it has to be sold within a day, otherwise it collapses, and the customer bites on all the ice grains.
Certain variations on the base mass are allowed.
It will be more exciting with the flavors.
For the taste in the ice cream, Maestro Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that you buy in the fruit department or with the sweets of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
"The suppliers will all try to turn on dozens of flavored additives to you."
“But you should just experiment.”
Either in the case of the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit.
Or just with the ice cream from the white base mass, which becomes a yellow cream with eggs and with cocoa powder as the basis for all sorts of chocolate seductions.
Now the students are allowed to the ice machines.
Luciano makes them four different types of vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla flavor or other natural additives.
The same experiment is also subjected to the fruit ice cream varieties.
More flavorings, more fruit puree - this is not necessarily better in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream doesn't necessarily taste nuttier if it contains more hazelnuts.
The most popular kiwi ice cream is the working group, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
Only a balanced mixture correctly highlights the taste of a gelato, says Luciano.
Ice cream production is a computational task: If peach puree with a lot of sugar is used, the sugar content in the basic recipe must be reduced.
For lemon ice cream, an extra portion of sugar is required.
Luciano pulls out a device with which it determines the sugar content of the fruit varieties (winemakers measure the Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, tables make the computer shop easier.
Making ice doesn't require as much physical effort as it used to.
Not only the device for the automatic production of the base mass helps.
There is also a device in which the finished ice mixture is creamy and cooled to sub-zero temperatures at the same time.
Despite all automation, small breakdowns are not absent.
The Brazilian Gustavo spills himself and his course colleagues from top to bottom with fruit puree, as the oversized hand blender gets out of control.
"In every course," says Maestro Luciano, "it's only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in Twilight
The European food authority Efsa is subverted by the industry experimenting with gene plants.
The expert group Testbiotech, which sees itself as an independent institute for the impact assessment of biotechnology, is now formulating this accusation.
"It sounds like a conspiracy theory, but we documented it well," Testbiotech chief executive Christoph Then told reporters in Munich on Wednesday.
The head of the Efsa expert group for genetically modified plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa expert have also been under contract with the Ilsi lobbyist association for years.
It is paid for by corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has been instrumental in the Efsa test regulations for gene plants and is thus in a clear conflict of interest, criticizes Then.
The Efsa regulations are identical in the same way as the Ilsi position papers and thus carry the handwriting of the industry, which is actually to be controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a conflict of interests.
For example, a high-ranking Efsa manager is recently without conditions or transitional period to the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta - and has thus changed sides.
The Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk (MDR) had also recently revealed personnel links between the controlling EU authority and the industrial lobby, which has made the Federal Environment Agency as well as EU parliamentarians clairvoyant.
Efsa, meanwhile, cannot detect a conflict of interest.
We are relying on all serious data, including those of the industry, as long as they are of high professional quality, according to a statement.
From the experts who work for Efsa, one does not demand that they have no contacts with the industry.
But you would have to disclose them.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the USA.
This describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics - including the risk assessment for biotechnology without a lobbying mandate.
In the matter, independent experts such as Then criticize that genetically modified crops are currently approved without any feeding test in animals and that the reaction of gene plants to environmental influences is not tested.
"We want to know what, for example, genetically modified corn is doing on the field," says Then.
Current practice is to test only isolated proteins, but not the whole gene plant, which does not provide reliable results.
"If you're not looking for the risks, how are you supposed to find them?" Then asks accusatoryly.
Angelika Hilbeck sees it that way.
The scientist has been researching genetic engineering since 1994 and is currently working at the Technical University of Zurich.
In this area, as in the USA, the industry is now increasingly trying to influence or discredit critical scientists in this area, as in the USA.
There are therefore hardly any researchers who are not intertwined with corporations.
Critical studies for companies would generally not be published.
"The industry controls security research," Hilbeck claims.
The trace of the stones
Uli Gsell has also worried some, a total of about 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he stood in front of Stuttgart station, the tuba on his back.
It was demo.
It was snowing.
The story is well known: in September, the excavators had approached and had begun to abort a large piece of the north wing.
The Stuttgart world was no longer the same: tens of thousands demonstrated against S21, the billion-dollar lowering of the station.
When it came to the construction stop, much of the wing was in ruins.
Broken into 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer mussel limestone, a soft coarse stone, built between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, 43 years old.
He's got himself a few of the chunks.
"These stones are relics."
"You must not disappear."
He raves: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and earthly."
When he sawed one up, he smelled of cigarette smoke.
What he's going to do with the chunks, he doesn't know yet.
Stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The trace of the Stuttgart stones leads into a forest near Tübingen to a former ammunition depot of the French army, where Manuel Rongen has built his stone empire.
The 44-year-old is trading old stones.
He bought everyone who was killed when demolishing in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame they would be ground into gravel or disappear into the landfill," he says in his office, a wooden shop that was once a guardhouse.
He was insulted and threatened, he said, when it was written in the newspapers in September that he had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition contractor.
But he's been talking to the S-21 opponents for days.
And he explained to them that he could not do anything for the demolition.
And if it happens, it is the most sensible thing if the stones are used further.
About 200 S-21 opponents then took one of the on average 80 kilos heavy cuboids, unit price 6.50 to 14 euros.
As a souvenir, but also in the hope of being able to give him back during a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes, 25 large truckloads.
About half are still stored in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owners, landscape gardeners, housebuilders.
From everywhere they had come and dragged away what trunk space and trailers could carry.
The Stuttgart stones of the nudge have long since turned into "Mäuerle" or into boundaries of herb beds.
"Actually, this stone is nothing special," Rongen says.
"Wouldn't be the political component."
He gets into his SUV, takes a tour of his 20-acre empire.
He studied law and dropped out, later biology, then he became interested in computers and eventually became a stone merchant.
And stone lovers.
It stores 40000 tonnes of stones.
From all over Germany, he carts his treasures together.
He says he is the Republic's largest old stone merchant.
He's slowing down.
In the snow are elaborately hewn sandstones.
"They once belonged to the Dresden Marienbrücke," he says.
Elbe sandstone, yellow, warm, he raves.
"My favorite stone."
It goes up the way through the forest.
He points to a pile: red sandstone, formerly part of Karlsruhe station.
And on.
"Beautiful travertine."
Once the quads belonged to the grandstand of the Stuttgart Neckarstadion.
Everywhere in the snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgart police headquarters, reddish granite from the Cathedral of St. Blasien, Tuff from the Heilbronn Hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks of how the stones used to be carved by hand and moved with simple pulleys and ox carts, he becomes quite awe-inspiring.
“It would be a scandal if you shredded something like that.”
He has not become rich, certainly not rich.
But 14 people are employed by the stone merchant today, in addition, stonemasons, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassblower and a horticulturalist have settled up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it's satisfying," says the residual recycler.
Soon he will have to go to Cologne.
There are stones to save there too.
Talent struggle for high-potentials
There is a lot of crowding at the buffet.
16 students crowd around salmon rolls, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Volkswagen have invited the mechanical and design students to a workshop.
In a kind of idea competition, they are to talk about the car of the future together with VW developers - and get to know Volkswagen by the way.
In the competition for the brightest minds, many companies are now going into close combat and, like VW, rely on cooperation with the universities.
Their mission: to recruit the most gifted graduates as early as possible in the lecture halls before they come to the job market and are courted by others.
And because the universities do not publish any lists of the achievements of their students, one tries to see and bind the exceptional talents in practical projects.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunschweig, the car company advertises the talents.
A young lady from the HR department distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with VW logo.
She tells the hopeful young talents of internship programs and student jobs and shows them ways into the Group.
Nico Selle from TU Braunschweig is responsible for the project with VW.
He sees the benefits for both sides: "The students get in touch with industry and gain experience."
"VW can get to know students at the same time, take a closer look at interesting candidates and consider who would be eligible as employees."
Such collaborations, according to Selle, are not unusual.
It is new that the students are so aggressively cheered for.
"Otherwise, the focus was more on the professional project," says Selle.
The battle for the newly graduates is likely to get even tougher.
In many industries, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large number of applicants.
But they have to tout and especially balt for highly skilled workers.
Especially graduates from the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the Association of German Engineers VDI, more than 40,000 engineering positions remained unfilled in October.
And the so-called engineering gap will become even bigger, according to VDI forecasts.
For the auditing and consulting company KPMG, Roman Dykta is on the hunt for talent.
He organizes elaborate recruiting events such as the KPMG race, a kind of modern scavenger hunt, in which the participants have to find their way using GPS coordinates.
The company intends to send eight promising students across the USA next year.
By the way, participants can look at KPMG stores and get to know the company.
Who is allowed to participate, decides in two selection rounds in advance.
Only the crème de la crème of the many applicants flies to the USA.
When punching and stinging around the high potentials at the universities, the guns are getting bigger and bigger, according to Dykta.
"We want to stand out from the crowd with the race."
"Only a simple sailing trip was too little for us."
For talent hunters Dykta, the bill seems to be coming up.
"We have contacted all participants of a similar action in the last year to date."
"Some are about to graduate and want to apply to us soon," he says.
In addition to the direct booing on the campus, small and medium-sized companies in particular also go on the prowl at professional fairs.
"We're trying to reach graduates at trade shows."
"For example, at the Intersolar," reports Sitha Stübe, human resources manager at the solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe knows about the problem of young talent.
There are currently 35 jobs advertised on the company website.
"It's very hard to fill vacant positions right now."
"That costs a lot of time and money," she says.
Another way is to get in touch with the university professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various universities, such as the University in Freiberg.
"The professors give indications that you can do internships with us or write your diploma thesis."
Expensive promotions are not the order of the day at the solar specialist.
For this, the company tries to promote itself with other advantages: personal atmosphere, flat hierarchies and easy communication.
"A large corporation often cannot offer this," says HR manager Stübe.
Money no longer plays the main role in the job search.
Flexible working hours, childcare or good promotion opportunities are other decisive factors.
Solarworld reported the 55th in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute. Place among the 100 best employers in Germany.
The institute prepares an annual leaderboard of German employers.
To this end, it asks employees how satisfied they are with their work and their job environment and looks at the framework conditions for the employees.
Human resources manager Stübe hopes that the placement will also provide plus points for job seekers.
"I think applicants are looking especially for outside reviews about a potential employer," she says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler from the German Employer Branding Academy advises companies that want to build a good reputation as an employer with a long-term strategy.
He advises his clients to be more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, especially internal measures.
"The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through one's own employees," he says.
In industry jargon, this is called internal employer branding, i.e. employer branding within its own workforce.
"Satisfied staff are the best ambassadors."
If you treat your people well and they identify with the company, they would advertise their employer to friends and acquaintances all by themselves.
"This is like a game with gang," Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
There will be no new oil wells off the coast of the US state of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming years.
A corresponding ban has been issued by the government in Washington - and thus its earlier plans definitively revoked.
Even off the Atlantic coast, new drilling remains prohibited for the time being.
Interior Minister Ken Salazar said on Wednesday.
The trigger for the strict ban, which is to apply for at least the next five years, is the explosion of the "Deepwater Horizon" drilling platform in April.
Before the disaster, which cost eleven workers their lives and led to the largest U.S. environmental disaster, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The proponents want to reduce the dependence of the US on oil supplies from abroad.
Who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf has not yet been conclusively clarified.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy company BP, which is confronted with billions of claims.
A commission of inquiry on behalf of Obama is scheduled to present its findings later in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling stop imposed after the explosion.
Subsequently, various oil companies had immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
With tighter controls and stricter security regulations, Obama and Salazar want to rule out a renewed disaster.
Currently, the competent control authority, which has fallen into disrepute after numerous allegations of corruption, is being fundamentally reformed.
In parallel, Obama has said he plans to close lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies.
The industry is now publicly warning that the production volume in the Gulf would be significantly lower than before due to stricter regulation.
"The government's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry," is the result of a recent industry survey by consultant firm BDO - even before Wednesday's drilling ban.
The American Energy Alliance also laments the uncertainty in the industry: "Nobody knows what exactly will change with the regulation."
Investments in new funding projects would be postponed until further notice - at the expense of growth.
Ogoniland burned down
The water in the rivers is oil-brown, it smells like at the gas station: billions of liters of drained crude oil have destroyed nature in Nigeria's Ogoniland.
People live on theft, corruption and illegal oil cooking.
Celestine Akpobari means well.
"Don't worry," the eco-activist reassures the journalists: "You're still going to get enough oil mud in front of the lens today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has pursued the attempt to photograph a boy wading up to the chest in the water with the streaks surrounding him: in the rainbow-colored water shine, the scene looks almost pretty.
That brown crude oil swaths float beneath the surface is not to be seen.
She used to collect shrimp here, says Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the sluggish flowing water is completely dead.
Five years ago, tons of crude oil poured out of a bristled pipeline into the huge wetland.
Fishermen from the nearby town of Bodo now have to row for six hours to get into fish-containing waters: Ogoniland, located in the heart of the Niger Delta, is considered one of the worst polluted regions in the world.
On the journey through the mangrove swamps crisscrossed by rivers, the full extent of the devastation becomes apparent.
Instead of bright water, the motorboat digs up brown broth, whoever dives his hand into the water pulls out oily fingers.
The roots of the mangrove trees protrude like black liquorice sticks from the ground, sadly leaving occasional palm trees hanging their fronds.
Swarms of birds, as are otherwise customary in wetlands, are sought in vain: as soon as the outboard is silent, ghostly peace spreads in the former paradise, which smells like a gas station.
"What's happening here is ecological warfare," says Celestine Akpobari finsterly: "We live in constant danger to health."
The war comparison is appropriate.
The settlement area of the Ogoni is a battlefield that has been contested for decades: more than 60 years ago, the first explorers from Europe invaded here, here in the 1980s the first resistance was organized with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, here the Shell Group had to stop its production in 1993, because it became too dangerous for its oil workers.
Even today, the company is still denied the return to Ogoniland: While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped daily from the entire delta region of three times the size of Switzerland with over 5000 drill sources and 7000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in the Ogoniland are broken, the situation is too unstable for the Group.
Every few hundred meters, steel frames protrude like bizarre sculptures from the water: "Christmas trees" are called the heads of the boreholes far too tender.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them corroded to the core.
Again and again, such a drill head breaks apart, says Akpobari, then a constant stream of crude oil runs into the water.
More than two billion liters have flowed into the Delta's ecosystem in 50 years, according to expert estimates: year after year, the amount of oil that penetrated the sea off Alaska in the accident of the supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago - one of the biggest environmental disasters in human history.
Who is responsible for the ongoing eco-GAU, is disputed.
While the Shell Group blames sabotage and organized oil theft for more than 90 percent of pollution, environmentalists see bursting drill heads and leaky pipelines as the primary causer.
Shell is in Nigeria much lower safety standards than usual in the world, the US scientist Richard Steiner accused the company in 2008: The rate of defects in the lines alone is "many times higher than elsewhere".
In a place that looks from a distance like an abandoned, oil-smeared workshop in the open air, figures emerge from the mangroves: they are naked and oil-smeared up to the neck.
Under one of the many barrels, some of which are connected to tubes, some of which can be seen arbitrarily scattered on the premises, a fire flickers: an illegal small refinery.
In the barrel, the crude oil is heated over the fire for several hours, explains Michael, the group's chief executive.
First, petrol penetrates through the pipes into the collecting pot, later dripping at the end of the line kerosene and finally diesel out.
Michael and four employees produce up to four barrels of diesel of 300 liters per day: "This brings us 34,000 naira" - around 22 dollars.
The Delta residents are taking advantage of the chronic fuel shortage in the largest petroleum state in Black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cookers can still undercut the ridiculously low diesel price with almost 40 euro cents per liter: because they get their raw material for free.
It comes from "bunkers" who tap the pipeline network across Ogoniland: According to experts, the country is lost at least 16 million liters of crude oil daily in the entire Niger Delta.
Only a vanishingly small part of the provisionally intermediate raw material, however, is illegally refined: organized criminal networks, which should also include politicians and high-ranking military personnel, fill the lion’s share into tankers and sell it on the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate whether the environmental disaster is more due to the activities of the population or the lax mode of production is purely academic.
"If the oil companies were not perceived as invaders and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the livelihood of the fishermen, there would be no sabotage, theft and illegal refineries."
In the meantime, however, the relationship between Ogoni and Shell, in particular, is so destroyed that only a withdrawal of the company would be in question: "Perhaps other nationalities such as the Chinese turn out to be better."
Michael's getting nervous.
"High time you disappear," says the muscular oil man.
"Every minute the soldiers can come."
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the special unit of the armed forces, they are not threatened with arrest, but a painful bribe.
The soldiers, who are mainly from the north of the country, also want to benefit - like all Nigerians - from the raw material.
"This damn stuff has put our country on the dog in every way," Akpobari says.
Investigators discover dangerous construction fault in A380 engines
The A380 apparently has a major security problem.
Investigators have discovered a possible construction fault during the investigation of an emergency-landed machine, which could lead to a "catastrophic engine failure".
The airline Qantas now wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
The passengers of the emergency-landed Qantas Airbus in early November apparently had much more luck than previously known: The Australian Aviation Safety Authority has identified a major safety problem in the engines of some A380 aircraft in its investigation - and now warns of a possible construction fault.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: With an oil hose connection, he could create fatigue cracks and leaks, it said in a statement published this Thursday by the agency ATSB.
This could have led to "a catastrophic engine failure."
Affected by Rolls-Royce engines in 20 A380-series aircraft.
Below is the Qantas Airbus, which is located on the 4th. November had to make an emergency landing in Singapore.
The Australian airline has now launched legal action against the UK turbine maker.
She filed a statement of grounds at an Australian federal court in Sydney that allows him further legal action against the company.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said his airline will seek damages for the incident in early November.
In the fire of the engine, parts had detached and the wings had been damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil fire as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines worldwide now have to be replaced.
Australian investigators announced they would conduct further safety tests on the superjumbos, which are equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The safety problem was considered to be sufficiently important to inform all those affected.
After the Qantas plane's emergency landing, the airline had kept its A380 fleet on the ground for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily left about three of its eleven A380s on the ground.
Lufthansa changed engines on an A380 as a precautionary measure.
The double-decker aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
Nationwide snowfall triggers traffic chaos
Germany all in white: Overnight snow has fallen almost all over the country.
There is chaos on many roads, trains and flights are down.
At least three people were killed in car accidents.
Winter frosts Germany: In freezing temperatures, almost the whole republic is snowed on at night to Thursday - which leads to traffic chaos in many places.
In the north and to the east there are partly 15 centimeters thick snow cover.
Traffic is severely restricted on several motorways and many roads.
On the A7 near Flensburg, the winter service was in continuous use, but was not finished with the constantly new snow.
In addition, violent gusts swept over the Baltic coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) expects storm surges of 1.2 meters above the normal level on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the morning.
In Saxony, snow drifts on the highways and federal highways led to significant problems.
According to the meteorological center Meteomedia, the alarm level in Saxony Switzerland was therefore fully announced - the highest level ever.
In some cases, 30 centimeters of fresh snow fell there, fresh and strong winds caused drifts.
There, several trucks and cars got stuck during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, too, police authorities reported major disruptions on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to stalled traffic and traffic jams.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by the snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and the north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rails or destroyed overhead lines and turnouts are the main problems.
In Saxony, long-distance traffic from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
In Saalfeld, Thuringia, an ICE had to stop its journey to Munich.
The 165 passengers were provided by firefighters and rescue workers with wool blankets, food and drinks on the train.
Snow winds swept across the streets.
At major German airports, the snow winds lead to numerous flight cancellations.
In Munich, according to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been reported.
In Frankfurt am Main, 40 flights have already been cancelled, according to a Fraport spokeswoman.
Winter service is in continuous use.
Although only a few stranded passengers are at the airport, there are still almost 400 camp beds available for them.
There were accidents on many roads on Wednesday evening.
In the evening, a truck driver died in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The engine driver was slightly injured.
A similar accident occurred near Nuremberg due to snow-covered roads: Here, too, a truck was caught on a level crossing because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver was killed.
Four passengers were injured in the train - the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was therefore closed until the morning hours.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after she had rolled over with her car near Aschaffenburg on a smooth road.
However, the meteorologists have good news: Although the snow will still be loose and powdery and therefore already stir up in light gusts.
But the wind will weaken.
Only the Baltic Sea is hit by fast and storming winds.
However, it remains very cold - locally up to minus 15 degrees.
Deutsche Bank is looking for a buyer for their twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its landmark: According to a newspaper report, the Geldhaus is looking for buyers for the two office towers at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could bring in up to 500 million euros.
Deutsche Bank has just made its corporate headquarters pretty: the twin towers in Frankfurt’s banking district have been modernized; in the meantime, the bankers have been allowed to return to their old workplace.
But now the financial group apparently wants to get the cost of the renovation out again - and is looking for a buyer for the two high-rise buildings, as the "Financial Times Deutschland" writes, citing a spokesman.
The spokesman did not give reasons for the planned sale.
"We always check whether it makes more sense to own or sell properties ourselves and subsequently rent back," he said.
Thus, Germany's largest credit institution is already resigning its headquarters after a short time.
The bank had only taken over the double towers in mid-2007 for 272 million euros from the investors of an in-house fund and subsequently extensively restructured it.
The energy conversion devoured the data according to around 200 million euros.
A sale would probably bring the bank a lot of money.
According to the newspaper, industry experts estimate the value of the towers, which have now been renamed "Greentowers", to be around 500 million euros.
Whether the buildings will be sold again to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor is currently still open, the spokesman said.
Thousands mourn dead buddies
More than 10,000 people have thought in New Zealand of spilled miners who were declared dead after several explosions at a mine.
The bodies could not still be recovered because the security situation in the accident shaft is still precarious.
Nearly two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred at the Pike River Mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried underground.
A probe had been let down into the accident shaft but had discovered no trace of survivors.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and other subsequent explosions, no rescue workers were able to descend for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts had assumed that there was no longer a chance of survival for the buddies.
The bodies have not been recovered so far.
Now relatives and friends remembered the dead with a memorial service.
Ten thousand people had gathered in bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
They were silent for two minutes.
In honor of the spilled miners, 29 tables were set up, on which helmets, lamps and the names of the buddies could be seen.
Pictures and personal items, including garments and surfboards, also found their place here.
In front of the country's government buildings, flags were waving at half-mast.
New Zealand has hoped that the miners would come to the surface "from the depths of the earth," New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told attendees of the memorial service.
"But they never came home."
He could not conclude with the death of his son until he saw his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the pit.
In addition to the prime minister and relatives of the victims, several foreign diplomats attended the memorial service.
In the first explosion on 19. Miners of British and South African origins had also been buried in November.
Rescue workers began putting out a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Once the explosive gases are displaced, it will begin to cool down the glowing temperatures inside the mine, Police Chief Gary Knowles told journalists.
Hell, warrior!
Does Splatter fit the art cinema?
The director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores old genre limits with his fighter epic "Walhalla Rising."
Which audience may the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought of when he shot "Walhalla Rising"?
A captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and relocates his opponents with almost superhuman powers - sounds ideal for young male spectators in search of bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to use rabid killing methods and tears his enemies's gedes out of the living body when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Einauge, as he is actually called, does not say the whole film about a word, and the other characters can only be carried away to one or two sentences or a few agonizing screams of death.
Otherwise, silence is made and revelled in the creepy-nice hilly landscape of Scotland, which offers the backdrop to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult cinematists with an interest in existentialism and very quiet camera rides.
Nice, if a film has several target groups, it only hurts if they exclude each other.
Director Winding Refn has been considered a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino since his wild and styled drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream with a little more humor or somewhat less brutality to the arthouse.
Most art cinema friends are likely to be deterred by the splashing brain mass and the guts.
The action fans die of boredom at the latest when Einauge, for freely interpretable reasons, sets off for a force of violent Christian missionaries via ship to Jerusalem and is stuck in an eternity in the slack and fog, before the crew apparently arrives in America and continues to remain silent there.
No wonder, then, that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a cinema rental in Germany and has now only been released on DVD.
This is particularly a pity because of the magnificent pictures, but also because behind the pretentious to blood-dripping facade hides a sometimes exciting piece of cinema that deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, it's all atmosphere, a film-made fever dream.
And there is no escape from this for the spectator.
Refn hardly gives him a moment of relaxation and slowly laces his throat with his icy pictures and the dark trance-like soundtrack, but above all with the unbelievable hatred that strikes him from the hearts of the characters.
Only a little blonde boy who stands faithfully by the side of the eye preserves something like innocence, all others are driven by anger.
Most of all the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, but who eventually becomes a warrior from hell for enemies and temporary allies, possibly the ambassador of the devil himself.
It means ruin, but perhaps only for the already corrupt.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that you can hate and admire, to annoy, excitement and wonder.
An experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The IAEA has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is resisting to comment on this - it still allows checks.
Around midnight from 5 to 6. September 2007 at least four Israeli F-15 I warplanes attack a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It stands on the banks of the Euphrates; the nearest larger town, 30 kilometers away, is Dair as-Saur.
Her name appears in International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) documents when it comes to the reactor that Syria allegedly built in the cuboid with help from North Korea, hidden in a valley that is coming off the electricity.
According to a briefing by the US foreign intelligence agency CIA from the end of April 2008, the reactor, which was also known as the nearby village of el-Kibar, would have been well suited to produce plutonium - from which nuclear weapons could be built.
For other purposes, however, the technology from the 1950s is hardly suitable.
The CIA presented a video presentation with blurred satellite images.
By computer animation, she blended in where which components of the reactor were supposed to have been before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model from the Yongbyon nuclear center.
In addition, she presented photos showing the building up close or even the interior.
The reactor was about to be put into operation, it said, but had not yet been fitted with fuel rods.
Today, more than three years after the bombing, hardly any more is known than then, even the puzzles became rather larger over time.
Former President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoir that although the CIA was quite sure before the attack, it was quite certain that Syria was building a reactor in el-Kibar, but saw little evidence that there was "an active nuclear weapons program" in the country.
Some intelligence officers in Europe prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of an "alleged reactor," even if they consider the CIA presentation "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as is the IAEA.
Asked how safe he was to have a reactor in front of him, a senior U.N. diplomat responded only lapidarily in the summer, the IAEA had "enough material to ask questions."
The debris of the alleged "untapped military building" was hurriedly removed by the Syrians and thoroughly planned the site.
Still, in June 2008, an IAEA team under former chief inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium made by humans in el-Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA received satellite images of commercial providers from the period immediately after the attack, which should be more meaningful than those presented by the CIA.
However, these recordings are not available on the market because the unknown client - perhaps Israel - bought them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot verify its authenticity independently.
Syria has always claimed to have never operated a secret nuclear program or built a reactor.
Uranium comes from Israeli weapons, Damascus said.
But the IAEA rejected this as unlikely after analyzing the particles.
Since then, Damascus has refused to discuss it - as well as the satellite images.
In addition, it denies the inspectors a second inspection in el-Kibar and access to the debris of the bombed building.
Israel is also silent.
"We will never comment on this," the Premier Ehud Olmert, who was in office at the time of the attack, recently reaffirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has been dragging on inconclusively since June 2008 and "is increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," as a senior Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna admits - after all, there is a serious violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which the IAEA is attending.
As a key to progress in the investigation, the IAEA apparently sees three other facilities that are supposed to be "functionally connected" to the suspected reactor - and, unlike this, still exist.
So far, the inspectors have not disclosed which systems are, nor what function they have or what makes them seem suspicious.
According to information from the Süddeutsche Zeitung, they are internally referred to at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah, again derived from nearby cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these locations and located a building complex at Masyaf on satellite images, which is most likely one of the suspicious objects.
It may be located in or directly next to a military base - with that very reason, Syria is denying the IAEA access to the three places.
In Vienna, it is said that the Syrians feared a fishing expedition - that the IAEA would be forwarded by the US to spy on military installations.
Because the nuclear detectives had become aware of the facilities through a tip from the U.S. intelligence services.
The IAEA has clues, including satellite photos, that material has been transported back and forth between the three locations and the cuboid on the Euphrates.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the plants could be "related to fuel production."
However, there is "no evidence of sensitive activities", i.e. uranium enrichment or reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The reactor type is operated with uranium, which is not enriched.
But where the uranium should have come from and where the plutonium for the bomb was to be separated from it later, there are at most plausible assumptions on these central questions.
It is also unclear whether debris that could contain valuable traces was stored in the three locations.
As if the hundreds of truckloads had disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the rubble has gone.
Located just a few kilometres from el-Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, the al-Tibni salt mine, which Syria investigated in 1998 for its suitability as a storage facility for radioactive waste, the IAEA is considered unlikely.
Former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley had recently linked them to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the renowned Jane's Intelligence Review magazine.
But images from orbit show that Syria was doing earthwork in the three suspicious locations and removing large containers after the IAEA demanded access.
This can be coincidence, but it has hardly helped to remove the suspicion.
In addition, diplomats say that the IAEA has spent several months developing a plan for inspections there that should allow Syria to maintain any military secrets - only the effort shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
Meanwhile, Damascus also ironed out this proposal.
Had Western diplomats in Vienna anestimated a year ago that the reactor was destroyed, so the matter has no high urgency, brings, for example, U.S. Ambassador Glyn Davies for a few months so-called special inspections into play, one of the sharpest funds that the Vienna nuclear authority has to enforce controls.
IAEA chief Yukiya Amano, who would have to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "an option for which I am open in the future," but he is still hesitant.
There is a high risk in this way: on the one hand, a majority in the Board of Governors of the IAEA is needed, and some of the 35 countries represented there are anything but eager for escalation.
On the other hand, as one diplomat points out: "What if they find nothing in the end?"
Love in times of war
Since Angelina Jolie started working on her still-nameless directorial debut in the summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself, a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
You don't know much more about it - but that's enough for unrest.
The rumor persists, the woman, a Muslim woman, falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Bosnian women's associations immediately protested, after which some of the days of shooting planned in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary at short notice.
Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary and in post-production, but it is still protesting in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the organization of female war victims wrote about the UN refugee agency UNHCR to Jolie and demanded a meeting with the actress, has now reported a Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is herself an ambassador of the UN refugee agency.
She is not diplomatic - she offered the women a meeting in Hungary weeks ago, but they refused.
The meeting must take place in Bosnia, according to Hasecic.
There were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie’s attitude towards the victims tells her enough about the script.
Her organization has recommended to fire Jolie as ambassador, according to the UN refugee agency, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for scenes?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture, which got to read her script, granted a filming permit for Sarajevo after some back and forth - it's not entirely clear why Jolie didn't come anyway.
The young author herself asserts that she pursues no political intentions with her film, has worked her way into the Yugoslav conflict with a lot of effort, wants to show the terrible consequences of the war and give a voice to all the sides involved.
However, it remains vague with the content.
So a second synopsis circulates to the film on the net, which sounds quite different: The lovers knew each other in it even before the outbreak of war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp, in which he works as a guard.
Which sounds considerably different from the variant "rape victim has a crush on torture servants".
That Jolie's film actually starts before the war - that much is certain.
The pressure on them, according to Jolie, is "unfair and based on misinformation."
Now only the hackers of Hollywood can give her peace: By putting the script, like so many before, illegally on the net.
Nothing like getting out of here
This evening it is finally really round for the Irish.
No sign of sadness.
The home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the USA too much.
The fans are jobbing with joy with loud music, they stomp with their feet.
The Bailey pub in southern Ireland's Cork quakes because players throw table tennis balls over a three-metre distance into beer cups - and hit.
"Beer pong" is the bizarre spectacle, there is 500 euros victory premium to win plus plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championships in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy; this shrill drinking game and the reserved computer scientist, that doesn't really fit together.
And yet the 26-year-old is trying to enjoy distracting himself from the drilling question of what the future will bring.
His plan is not gaming fun in Las Vegas, he will hold job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a queasy feeling about it," he says.
"It's so far away from home and I don't have any work there yet."
After all: His girlfriend is already waiting for him in Auckland - "she had jerk, she had her desired job as an event manager, maybe a good sign," says the young man, smiling.
Because of poor prospects at home, two of Tanner's three siblings have already sought their fortune abroad.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a job as an IT consultant in London.
The boys go: As with the Tanners, it looks on the island in many families.
100,000 Irish people will probably leave the country in the near future, predict experts from the economic and social research institute ESRI in Dublin.
By 2015, they expect 200,000 emigrants.
For the small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, a heavy loss.
If the forecasts are true, there is a wave of emigration comparable to the one that Ireland suffered from in the 1980s.
After a decade of recovery, which brought great prosperity for the Irish, drearyness is now spreading again.
The economic crisis is particularly unsettling the young, well-educated Irish, for whom it has so far only been uphill.
Job loss and social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone was needed, money was in abundance.
Meanwhile, three out of ten women and men under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, there are plenty of letters from young emigrants who complain: "Everything is going down the drain in Ireland."
"There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers - but who can, goes away and our country loses an entire generation with it."
"The last one will turn off the lights, please."
Law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Irish Student Union, sees a bleak future emerging because the government is just eye-wiping and no longer offers young people future prospects.
"They are reducing minimum wages, but they don't have a strategy on how to create new jobs," the 20-year-old says.
She watches her fellow students hang themselves from one unpaid internship to the next.
Her biggest concern, she says, is to have to emigrate herself in four years.
"This thought is sad and depressing."
In the process, men like Stephen McLarnon try to cast the issue positively.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a trade fair that offers an all-round service on the subject of work abroad.
"For young professionals, working abroad is a great opportunity to take the first steps on the career ladder," says the manager.
On its website, photos show surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada.
The message is clear: working abroad is not a galley service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something elsewhere, Seán O'Donovan has known for half a year.
Because there was nothing more to do for the 29-year-old engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
In Gelsenkirchen, they are currently pulling up a fashion house.
In January we continue to Hannover or Berlin, the next project.
O'Donovan rarely sees his homeland in the meantime, because he does extra shifts to be able to pay off the loan for his house at home.
"The situation is already a bit crazy," he says as he steps over the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time.
"I earn money in Germany for a house in Ireland where I'm almost never again."
He laughs a little embarrassed and walks through chilled-out rooms.
The small house stands in a fine residential area with well-kept front gardens, in the driveways large, expensive cars park.
Together with a sister, O'Donovan bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent credit-financed.
"It was crazy times, there was simple money without a lot of questions," he says.
Is he afraid it could go wrong with the loan?
O'Donovan ponders for a while, pours hot tea and says, "I don't have children to feed through and I'm young; even if everything goes wrong, I can start over again."
The civil engineer does not like the lamentation that he hears often at the moment.
"Nobody has to go hungry - our situation is far from as dramatic as in earlier times here on the island," he says.
"Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - maybe that's how we feel like Irish people."
He laughs and then tells of his father, who went to England in the last major economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and life went on in Ireland, quite simply."
Cian Tanner likes that thought.
Leave the future open and just see how life goes somewhere else.
He has already had a few years of work in London and why shouldn’t things be going well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
But there is still one thing that worries him these days: the celebration of his 27. Birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He fears it could degenerate into a farewell party.
"Just not too many emotions," he says, drinking a big sip of his beer.
"Goodbye, that sounds scary."
"Let's call it a walking party, quite loosely, with a few friends, a few drinks, a few games."
The Democatric Routine
The democracy movement in Latin America is getting stronger, just like supporting private companies.
Crime is a bigger problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than that of the United States.
These were the results of the Latinobarómetro survey, which was conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively in The Economist.
This survey has been conducted regularly since 1995 and thus shows the change of opinion in this region.
Two facts are particularly striking in this year's September and October poll.
First, the good mood in Latin America
and secondly, the growing interest in democracy and its main institutions.
In many countries on the South American Pacific coast, the democratic movement has increased sharply (s. Table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has been around approx. 6% is growing, the number of democracy advocates rose from 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
Even in Mexico, where the economy has been recovering since last year's sharp slump, such a trend can be seen.
Yet only half of those surveyed in Mexico and Brazil, the region's most populous countries, are staunch Democrats, which lowers the regional average (e.g. Chart 2).
Ca. 44% of respondents said they are satisfied with their country's democratic practice. That’s as many as last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
About 34% trust their country's congress and 45% of their government. Both values correspond to those of last year, but show a significant increase compared to 2003 (17% and. 24%).
A decade ago, Latin America's economic crises undermined efforts for more democracy.
That this continued even during the Great Depression is possibly because Latin American countries experienced only a short period of recession and have recovered quickly.
In addition, the poor were caught by a stronger social network.
(According to reports by the UN Economic Commission for Latin America this week, the poverty rate in Latin America increased only slightly in 2009 and has fallen again by 32% this year.)
But from country to country there are strong differences in sentiment (s. Chart 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the popularity of outgoing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is reflected in widespread progress thinking.
In Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more noticeable and violent crimes have increased, this is less the case.
Only for the second time since the poll began, many respondents in Latin America see crime in their country as a bigger problem than in unemployment (s. diagram 5).
Ca. 31% say either they themselves or a family member have been the victim of a crime last year. But compared to 38% last year, the figures have fallen, reaching the lowest level since 1995.
The rising economic output is reflected in the stronger support of the private and market economies: approx. 71% of respondents nationally said that the private sector is essential for development, compared to 56% in 2007 (p. Diagram 6).
Ca. 58% explained that only the market economy can bring progress to their land, compared with 47% last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela have retained this view (and 80% are in favor of a private sector), although their left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, nationalizes many private companies.
Brazil has the largest weight in the region, according to 19% of respondents (18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared with 11% last year).
Respondents in Mexico and most countries in Central America, on the other hand, see the most influential country in the U.S., taking on this role in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua from Venezuela.
An election slouch
No one had expected the elections on 28. November in Haiti would be perfect.
But the facts far exceeded the fears of the election workers who rushed to the aid of the battered country.
Crowded ballot boxes, multiple votes cast, ballots in the gutter, destroyed polling stations and intimidation were just part of the problems.
Polling stations opened with hours of delay.
Many Haitians, many of whom had become homeless by the earthquake in January, roamed around in search of a choice.
Some eventually gave up altogether.
A dozen presidential candidates, including some suspected frontrunners, demanded the cancellation of election results due to alleged fraud.
There were some violent protests across the country.
Still, Edmond Mulet, the head of the U.N. mission in Haiti, described the election "as quite good in many respects."
According to a cautious statement from observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community, "these irregularities, however serious, do not necessarily invalidate the process."
In other words, the show goes on.
The electoral authority, which is supposedly committed to the unpopular outgoing President René Préval and his candidate, Jude Célestin, will the preliminary results on 7. Announce December.
The expected runoff election is scheduled for January.
There is still hope in the election.
The two leading opposition candidates, rap musician Michel Martelly and former first-lady Mirlande Manigat, have withdrawn their initial invalidity lawsuit.
If Jude Célestin, who finds little or no approval among the voters, declares the winner of the run-off election from the election authority, this could lead to problems.
Due to the cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of earthquake victims still live in tents, a low turnout was feared.
On election day, many Haitians were prevented from voting by a lack of organization.
Shortly before the election began, approx. 250,000 IDs needed for election have not yet been issued.
There's a lot at stake.
The donor countries regard a legitimate, recognized government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti.
The Haitians themselves agree.
Secretly to the middle
In the weeks after her husband's sudden death, Argentina's president, Cristina Fernández, experienced a wave of sympathy that drove her popularity rate up 20 points to over 50%. That's the highest level since her election in 2007.
Whether this will help her to re-elect next year, however, depends on whether the visibly grieving Cristina Fernández is more willing to compromise than her late husband, her predecessor and political partner Néstor Kirchner.
The signs of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also steered economic policy after his wife's election, frequently set out budgets that did not fully take into account tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential couple to spend the extra revenue at their own discretion.
On paper, the Fernández administration lost the majority in Congress last year.
Yet the opposition is divided and Kirchner's death after a heart attack on 27. October led to further quarrels.
Some regime critics from the ranks of the ruling Peronists stood behind Cristina Fernández.
Yet after chaotic sessions (where one parliamentarian punched another in the face and others accused the government of bribery) Congress failed to pass the 2011 budget.
"I will not discuss this," the president said.
The 2010 budget now also applies to the next year, which gives the president even more opportunity to spend money at her own discretion.
The economy is running hot: it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently 11.1%, but numerous private estimates - and wage demands of the unions - drive the value to almost 30%.
Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina was shaken by economic crises, declared growth and poverty reduction to be his main goals, rather than the inflation cut.
He refused to cooperate with the IMF, harassed the private sector and cleaned up the National Institute of Statistics and Census INDEC, which subsequently highlighted official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández take a more moderate path now?
She has called the private sector and union leaders for talks.
And according to official statements, wage increases are to be limited to 18% next year.
High world market prices for Argentina's agricultural products have given the economy a strong boost.
Yet inflation undermined the growth spurp by a major devaluation in 2002.
For this reason, Cristina Fernández may want to reconnect Argentina to the rest of the world in terms of finance.
Earlier this year, the government struck an agreement with securities holders who had rejected the country's earlier debt restructuring in 2001.
Now Fernández seems to be pushing for an agreement with the donors from the Paris Club, to whom they ca. $6.7 billion owes.
The Kirchners had always rejected a review by the IMF, as is customary elsewhere.
However, last month, Economy Minister Amado Boudou announced that the fund will provide "technical support" in the creation of a new national consumer price index. It looks like this is the first step towards cleaning up the INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active even without her husband's support after her term ends.
If so, she needs the support of the middle class, which has largely had enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy that has been shown to it will have ebbed away.
If she wants to win another election, she has to decide whether to quietly overturn many of her husband's political decisions.
Weak applause for China
Taiwan's voters are slowly approaching a closer connection to the mainland.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother beyond the strait?
On the 27. November more than 7.5 million voters, which is 70% of all eligible voters, set out to elect mayors and city councillors in the five city districts. This is seen as a broad assessment by President Ma Ying-jeou.
By building groundbreaking business relations, including a partial free trade agreement, Ma himself is a symbol of relations with the mainland. His policy has permanently changed the relationship with the Chinese motherland for the first time since 1949.
Ma passed the exam, but barely.
Although his Kuomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five mayors, it did not receive a majority.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates greater Taiwan independence, received nearly 50% of the vote, which received KMT 45%.
In a presidential election, this would have meant problems for Ma.
Since his election two years ago, his party's share of votes has been around about. 8% fell.
For the first time, the DPP even moved into the city councils together with the KMT.
During the election, the usual incidents in Taiwan, such as truck convoys with riot makers, flag-waving mass removals and only scantily clothed dancers, occurred.
There was even the obligatory, mysterious attempted murder.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan and honorary chairman of the KMT, gave a speech on a KMT candidate on the eve of the election,
When a man from the crowd shot him in the face. Lien was wounded and a bystander killed.
Bizarrely, it is not clear whether the shooter wanted to kill Lien or settle a dispute with the candidate.
Separately, the attack has affected the election, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, and put the DPP in a bad light, which has given the KMT more votes.
China may have been the biggest winner of the campaign.
Remarkably, relations with the mainland were not addressed.
Instead, candidates debated plans on social housing and job creation.
The Taiwanese love their de facto independence and reject China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like to focus on its relations with the government in Beijing.
But this time the DPP also avoided stoking the anti-Chinese feelings too much.
She responded to the new awareness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
For his part, he wants to be confirmed that the majority of Taiwanese support his China policy.
The government in Beijing will continue to pursue its strategy of luring Taiwan back to the community with economic incentives.
China immediately sent a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment security and medical cooperation.
It certainly also wants political integration. But the most important thing first.
It would rather wait until after the 2012 presidential election.
The DPP has since reinvented itself.
Two years ago, she was severely weakened: former party leader Chen Shui-bian was in prison for corruption.
During his presidency from 2000 to 2008, he vehemently advocated absolute independence.
But under Tai's reign, a new generation of moderate politicians developed and the DPP is fighting for the voices of the working people and the youth.
Tsai found great approval as the presidential candidate of the DPP, like Su Tseng-chang under Chen.
Her party is now doing everything it can to show that she, too, is capable of building close ties with Beijing.
Tsai is planning a think tank as a point of contact between the DPP and China. However, this requires unprejudiced discussions.
Tsai publicly stated that her party offers a "trustworthy alternative" to Mas's rash approach to China.
Chen seems very upset about this change.
From his cell, he declared that the candidates of the DPP had done better to insist on Taiwan's independence.
He even urged the pragmatist Su to forgo the presidential candidacy.
Even without Chen's interference, the DPP is struggling to elect its possible candidate.
The KMT will have to undergo its own self-analysis.
The values are poor, despite the rapid economic growth; the KMT candidates wanted to run their election campaign without him.
The main reasons for his unpopularity seem to be unemployment and the ever-increasing gap between rich and poor.
According to a KMT spokesman, he will redesign his cabinet as well as the local facilities.
The strong appearance of the DPP suggests that Taiwan only advocates a reapproach to a limited extent.
At the same time, most Taiwanese see economic cooperation with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "there is already no turning back."
Grammy nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding was surprisingly awarded in the Newcomer of the Year category
If you perform at a president's request, people will notice.
President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to perform at the ceremony on the occasion of the 2009 Nobel Prize ceremony. Now the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer has been surprisingly nominated for this year's Grammy in the Newcomer of the Year category.
Given that Spalding has already been a celebrated star in the jazz scene since her 2008 album "Esperanza," the nomination seems a little unusual. But it corresponds to the Grammy rules, according to which an artist may have published the album, with which he became known to the general public, at most three albums.
Her ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," is certainly a step forward. And with her buoyant voice and a good flair for pop, funk and Latin music, you can quietly compare Spalding with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success comes closest in 2003 as a jazz performer in this category of nomination of Spalding.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of the Vijay Iyer Trio was nominated in the category instrumental albums. This favorite of the critics experienced a huge success.
Competitors Iyers include. "Moody 4B" by veteran saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" by keyboardist John Beasley.
Trombone Shorty, a raubnant favorite from New Orleans and frequent guest in HBO's "Treme," was awarded in the category of contemporary jazz, where otherwise more albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber can be found.
The Secret Societ by the wild steampunk musician Darcy James Argue received well-deserved attention in the category large group. He is thus competing against the Billy Childs Emsemble with his chamber jazz and the adventurous Dave Holland and his octet, whose life-ablum "Pathways" is a good example for a bass player as a Democratic bandleader.
Grammy nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead in the classical categories
The classic nominations for the 53. Grammy Award includes a colorful mix of musicians and composers from all over the world.
The list is headed by Michael Daugherty's "Deux Ex Machina" for piano and orchestra with five voices, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work, with three voices.
Among the nominees with connections to South California, the Estonian composer Arvo Pärt is with his Symphony No. 4 "Los Angeles." This piece was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
L.A.-based composer Avner Dorman was also nominated for his mandoline concerto.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, from orchestra, opera, choir to solo recordings.
In the category of classical music producers, five artists were nominated this year - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
Among the nominated classical albums are Bruckner's Symphony No. 3 and 4 by the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" played by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey's "Dreamhouse" by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - the Art of the Castrati" performed by various artists; and Verdi's "Requiem" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and choir.
In the opera category, Berg's "Lulu of the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" by Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho's "L'Amour de Loin" by the German Symphony Orchestra Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" by the orchestra and choir of the Mariinsky Theater; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivan
As composers, Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty nominated for "Deus Ex Machina," Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer" for a Grammy.
Pärt's Symphony No. 4 was on the 4. January at the Disney Hall of the L.A. Philharmonic Premiered and Recorded under the direction of Esa-Pekka Salonen.
That about. 30-minute piece is titled "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is in prison in Russia.
Dorman's "Mondoline Concerto" received a nomination in the category Instrumentallo with orchestra.
The composer from L.A. stated that he had written the 15-minute piece especially for the mandolin artist Avi Avital, who performed the concert with the New York Metropolis Ensemble.
"I have used sounds from the Middle East and numerous North African tones and rhythms," Dorman explained in a telephone interview.
The conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category Orchestral Performance for a recording of the works of Stravinsky with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under his direction.
The instrumental soloists were the pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin, the organist Paul Jacobs, the violinist Julia Fischer and the harfinist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Only women were nominated as vocal soloists this year, including Anne Sofie of Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Mosque in Temecula wins approval of planning committee
The construction of a mosque in Temecula found the unanimous commitment of the local planning committee after a five-hour, often heated public hearing.
Critics accused the project of promoting both terrorism and traffic congestion.
But according to a statement from the Commission on Wednesday evening, the new religious centre complies with local regulations and will become an aesthetic eye-catcher.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahais, and many others," Hadi Nael, chairman of the Islamic Center of Temecula Valley, declared on Thursday morning.
"As an American, that makes me proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
"There are few opponents," he added.
"They're just very loud."
"There are wonderful people living in this valley."
The session began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center lasted almost until midnight, with the voices distributed fairly fairly evenly on both sides, according to press enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"There is no more America," was one comment.
"It's another planet of the monkeys, and the Statue of Liberty is dead in the sand."
"America is at an end."
Planned Islamic centers have also led to protests in other parts of the country, such as near Ground Zero, the scene of the terrorist attacks on the City of New York on 9/11. September 2001.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has called for non-violence.
His community with approx. 135 families have lived peacefully in Riverside County for years. But they wanted a bigger and better place than the warehouse they rented together with a manufacturer of water filtration systems.
The new, approx. 2,300 m2 mosque in the Mediterranean style should have two minarets and become about 13m high.
I want her on the approx. 17,500 m2 of plot of land on Nicolas Road near the Chaparral High School is being built.
Opponents can still appeal to the city council against the project.
Arsenic-resistant microbe could allow new life forms on Earth or elsewhere
The discovery of a foreign species of bacteria, which can live on arsenic, among other things, opens up new possibilities for new life forms on Earth and elsewhere.
Although scientists discovered this unusual bacterium here on Earth, it is a sign that life is possible even without the elements previously considered vital.
“This organism has two options.”
"It needs either phosphorus or arsenic to grow."
"That makes it very special, even though it's almost a kind of 'foreign' life form," explained Paul C.W. Davies of Arizona State University and co-author of the report, which appears Thursday in the online edition of the journal Science.
So far, six main elements have been considered vital - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
But as the scientists found out, the bacterium in California's Mono Lake grows even further even when it replaces phosphorus with arsenic.
"You wonder what else is possible," said the co-author of the report, Ariel D. Anbar from Arizona State University.
The discovery is an important step in the search for alien life, as scientists need to recognize life and its forms, according to Anbar.
The study deals with microbes found on Earth.
The announcement of a press conference in which no details of the discovery were disclosed gave rise to widespread speculation on the Internet that the report could be about the discovery of alien life.
This is not the case.
The discovery "shows that in other planetary systems, organisms can set in motion with the help of other elements and that the 'standard elements', which in our opinion are absolutely vital, are not necessarily firmly predetermined," explained Charles Cockell, a professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute at the Open University of Milton Keynes in the UK.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a novelty, because it shows that in basic biochemical processes and structures one element can be replaced by another," Cockell added.
This discovery was not accidental.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiological Institute, who led the study, chose Mono Lake due to high arsenic levels.
Because arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar, they assumed that microbes that are exposed to both may be able to replace one element with the other.
"The toxicity of arsenic is mainly based on the fact that it behaves chemically similarly to phosphorus."
“This makes it difficult for organisms to distinguish one element from the other.”
"But the difference is so great that arsenic is different from phosphorus. It enters our biochemical system, where it smudges virtually everything," explains Anbar.
The researchers exposed the bacterium GFAJ-1 to an increasing concentration of arsenic. It adapted and grew.
Although the microbe grows better in phosphorus, it can also survive in arsenic, shows that an arsenic-based life form can occur naturally, either on Earth or on another planet or moon, on which arsenic is more common.
According to Jamie S. Foster, a lecturer in microbiology at the University of Florida, is not new to the idea that phosphorus can be replaced by arsenic. But so far, there has been no working example.
Arsenic occurred more frequently in the early Earth years, she says, that's why science has assumed early life forms have used it.
"This gives reason to believe that life may also have developed differently than in the early Earth age," according to Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon's research team.
The research work was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Other stolen exhibition dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibition dogs stolen in front of a Bellflower motel were found Thursday, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's statement.
The four exhibition dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Tuesday when unknowns stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van where the animals were housed outside a Bellflower Motel 6 at night, according to authorities statements.
Two of the dogs were discovered Wednesday afternoon, and the last two Wednesday night, explains Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is that the dogs are well up," Whitmore said.
"They're in good condition."
"They were returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not provide specifics on the location of the dogs, nor about the circumstances that led to their discovery.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
"We don't want to say more about that," Whitmore explains.
"We're tracking some tracks."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available for information on Thursday.
They took their two dogs in reception Wednesday afternoon at a district animal shelter in Downey.
Representatives of the sheriff found the van and the two dogs in different locations in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old bitch - were unharmed, according to authorities statement.
Yet the Corgis Bunny and Peter, who Rickard and Peek wanted to introduce this week on behalf of their Japanese owners at the competition, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach because Trace was scheduled to take part in the contest.
As Peek told the Times on Wednesday, the other dogs should take part in other competitions on the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba show.
Southern California is a stop on the couple's nearly month-long tour from dog show to dog show.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked in at the motel.
They frequently stay in motels and park their van in front of their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer puppy, a Parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with them to their motel room.
The thick-fured Akitas and Corgis stayed in the van because it was cooler there.
They left the window a gap wide open so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their car stolen at 6:00 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek promised anyone who could give a clue to the Corgis a finder's wage. The animals were implanted with microchips for identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet clear whether a finder's wage would be paid.
The lion is again roaring after court approval of the MGM restructuring
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainties, MGM finally got the green light for a new start.
A New York bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "prepared" credit plan to pay off the $5 billion debt and pave the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company for new movies and television shows.
According to Thursday's statements, the plan meets the requirements of U.S. bankruptcy law, so nothing stands in the way of the restart of MGM led by Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spyglass Entertainment. Barber and Birnbaum will preside over the somewhat slimmed-down studio as chief executive.
The number of employees is from over 400 to approx. 320 lowered.
For MGM, Chapter 11 will not actually take effect until JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned $500 million bond to finance the new MGM productions.
At the moment, a consortium of the investment bank, which itself contributes $75 million, is managing the company. Funding is expected to be in place by mid-December.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the order to the investment bank Moelis & Co, the company management, which struggled with interest payments of $300 million/year, to help solve its financial problems.
In August, managing director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert who became known through his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis & Cooper's efforts to resolve the financial worries of MGM and pay out the studio's more than 140 dides lasted longer than expected.
After months of discussion, the parties decided at the end of 2009 to offer the company for sale.
But the auction attracted few bidders and no one wanted to pay the $2 billion demanded by the creditors.
In the spring of this year, it all started all over again when the MGM team began the restructuring plan, which was finally signed by creditors after months of debate and internal disputes in late October.
If MGM has officially weathered the bankruptcy in the next few weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a multi-million dollar bonus for their work.
The share for Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, amounts to $9.5 million.
Cooper, who was paid $375,000 a month for the management of the company, will receive a "success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production at MGM. This year, the studio released only one film and created an annual plan of seven or eight films to hit theaters in early 2012.
They are also planning two films after "The Little Hobbit" in co-production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate bond of between $265 million to $275 million for its financial stake in these two films, which are to be created under the direction of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who. 18% of the MGM loan funded, attempted a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, of which he is the largest shareholder.
But the last negotiations between the two companies did not lead to any result.
Tech Toys Keeps Your Gift Budget in Balance
This year's favorite among the gifts is the iPad, possibly followed by a Microsoft Kinect video console. Both gimmicks can tear a considerable hole in your gift budget.
An iPad costs as much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price of a Kinect game costs about 10 classic skipping ropes or approx. 48 doses of Play-Doh is equivalent.
But you can save your gift budget.
Recently, in search of three electronic toys, I visited under $80 three national toy retailers - a Wal-Mart, a Toys "R" Us and a BJ's Wholesale Club.
I immediately realized that Moore's law had come into effect. This year, the technology toys are more powerful and at the same time cost a little less than last year.
And although fewer new toys appear with their own website, in the most famous of this kind, Webkinz and Club Penguin, there is a wider offer.
More and more button cell-powered toys are coming to the market, and many contain rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(If not otherwise stated, all prices of Toys are "R" Us.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are plush figures, as big as guinea pigs singing a note when you press on their stomach.
Once pressing corresponds to a note, by pressing several times you can play a song.
Several sing-a-ma-jigs sing in harmony.
Attention: Once you have started pressing, you cannot stop.
For a combination of sequestration and dance, the dance star Mickey (Fisher-Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the Elmo Live technology developed last year, the animatronic doll offers interplays such as 'Simon says', and thanks to the novel hinged feet with wheel blocking, it dominates the Moon walk.
Children who tested the device use Mickey as dance teachers. However, her parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you're a child of the 80s, you're certainly remembering Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
Now he is back (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole bunch of question cards with which a car ride can become a lesson, with a know-it-all with autocorrect function as a teacher.
If you don’t want to entrust your smartphone to your child, here are three independent alternatives.
MobiGo by VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the cheapest and most user-friendly solution, equipped with a qwerty keyboard. However, the games included on it are not as educational as the one on the Leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is equipped with a new, brighter screen after Leapfrog's first major overhaul of the Leapster series.
None of the versions is compatible with older cassettes.
iXL by Fisher-Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) uses a system similar to iTunes for the games and eBooks, and thanks to the SD card drive, family photos can also be viewed on it.
Last but not least, there is Scrabble Flash ($30 by Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are no bigger than a matchbox and have their own LED screen.
The game is about putting the blocks together into words before time runs out. It is great for an impromptu spelling contest.
More and more toys have a kind of online connection.
If you go to the toy stores alone according to the offer, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To give your child an online animal at Club Penguin, for example, you can buy a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match figure package ($5 for children from 6 to 12) that contains a coin with a secret code.
When you enter the code online, your child will receive enough credits for two more parts in the Club Penguin Store.
These can be roller skates or a puffle stuffed animal.
The latest head cell-powered microrobot, Hexbug Nano ($10 for children from 5) is no bigger than the head of your toothbrush.
The bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicone legs in any direction.
It's fun to send him through a maze of blocks.
And he can take a lot of things.
Our fell from the kitchen table and even survived for some time in the mouth of our dog.
Police operations in China get softer
Like a training officer, Tang Shenbin walked across an urban square, checking his nervous subordinates, issuing orders with military authority and subdued voice.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's robust guardians of the urban order to fear and despise for their arbitrary raids and their penchant for violence -- impress viewers.
"Just stand!"
"Look straight ahead!"
"Show them," he whispered to them, "how pretty girls are like that!"
Four girls, barely outgrown to the teenage age, wearing white gloves and identical olive green jackets and trousers stood tight.
Four pairs of black pumps were in a straight line.
Four neat hats sat perfectly on the hair held with blue-and-white striped bows.
"To me, they look average," Mr. Tang remarks disdainfully.
"Models are pretty."
Several governments have already tried to polish the image of China's city inspectors.
In a city, all new applicants must have a university degree.
The province of Guangdong introduced a bright blue uniform instead of the grey-green ones.
Wuhan in Central China replaced violence with low-staring: in 2009, 50 officials reportedly circled an improperly set-up food truck and stared at the operator until he packed after half an hour and left the square.
Xindu, a district in Chengdu with a population of 680,000, wants to fundamentally change the image.
Since 2003, 13 women have been strengthening the city's police strips. They were selected special because of their appearance, good figure and youth.
They are supposed to give the crude police a softer, more feminine aspect.
But unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would hardly succeed in improving the bad picture the Chinese have of these city commands.
Rightly so, according to the critics.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce municipal laws with the help of fines or other administrative penalties.
Yet the Chinese media routinely show a different picture.
In January 2008, officials in Hubei province beat a spectator to death when he filmed them with his mobile phone, as they crushed a protest against a garbage dump.
Last year, a Beijing official training manual was stolen and published on the Internet. It describes how criminals can be beaten without bloodshed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon dealer suffered brain injuries after a scuffle involving five officers.
A video game brimming with violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows trained officials in China in an attack on street vendors.
"Chengguan scares the government," the national newspaper China Daily lamented last year, after further controversy over the tactics.
The newspaper demanded a "really thorough cleansing."
Skeptics are clearly inadequate in the current approach.
When the district searched for eight female recruits by advertisement in October, an editorial in the Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women should have real tasks or should only serve as an optical distraction.
Probably both.
According to job advertisements, women aged 18 to 22 were sought with good figure and "harmonic facial features."
You should be above average - over 1.5m or 5 feet, 2 1/2 inches.
The employment relationship ends when the 26th. Year of life.
According to the officials, the activity is too physically exhausting for women over 25.
"The most important thing is their image," an unnamed district official stated on the quasi-governmental website Rednet.com.
"Whether the candidates get the job depends first on their outward appearance, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then come temperament and "inner qualities."
"Female chengguan are like flower vases," he said, adding, "but beyond that, they have other duties."
Zheng Lihua, deputy head of the district's city administration, does not wish to agree with this description,
However, it admitted that in China, size requirements in job advertisements are not uncommon for both sexes.
The same applies to even facial features.
Whether this is equivalent to good looks is controversial in China.
But people with disabilities or physical discards do not need to apply.
"Unfortunately, we cannot use lame or hunchback here," said Mr. Zheng.
"Your image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, has apple cheeks and a well-shaped mouth.
She did not perceive as sexist that so much emphasis is placed on her appearance.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asks with an ironic look.
Her colleague with the dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, comments, "We have the task of representing the image of the city."
According to them, they do not regret the short attitude, as they have more ambitious career plans than simply chasing traders through the alleys to prevent them from doing business.
Every morning, the patrol deals with about twelve street vendors who try to sell as many rolls and tofu dishes as possible on foot or on a bicycle before they are chased away.
"Mr. Wang, please get out of here."
"We've told you this so many times!" explains Frl. Xu a dealer who had fled on foot and had temporarily let down his pasta kitchen, which was attached to a bicycle cart.
According to the officials, the activity is more monotonous than exhausting.
"It's the same almost every day," explains Huang Jing, 20, who studies sales in leisure time.
"All routine."
One reason for this is that the female officials are not allowed to confiscate the merchandise of the traders, like their male counterparts.
They can only threaten criminals with reporting them to their male superiors.
This is to protect them from public hostility, which officials in China are frequently exposed to.
This year, hundreds of residents of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan province, rioted after the rumor circulated that Chengguan officials had killed a merchant.
More than a dozen police and Chenguan officers were injured in the night-time incident, with 14 government vehicles overturned or set on fire.
Xindu has so far been spared from such riots.
But unrest cannot be ruled out.
Just two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang Square where the female officials patrolled that morning, over 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officials had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired contrary to the regulations on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop.
The owner shouted Zeter and Mordio.
After 15 minutes of hesitation, officers made their way to their vehicles with a grim face and continued with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator of the male patrol, was left behind. In the process, he turned over his white name tag to remain anonymous.
Like their colleagues, the coordinators - men over 40 - play a purely supportive role.
But they were not trained to present a clean image.
"Sometimes we're going verbal."
"Sometimes physically," explains Mr. Li soberly.
"Most of the time people start the argument."
Prosecutor won't indict Senator Ensign
Attorneys at the Justice Department have acquitted Senator John Ensign of the allegations raised against him after his affair with a former election worker and his attempt to lobby her husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
That decision ends the most serious legal accusation against Senator Ensign, the Nevada Republican. Until the scandal, which made headlines nationwide and put a damper on his career, he was considered a possible presidential candidate of the Republicans for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office announced, he was "highly pleased" with the verdict after the year-long investigation.
However, the Senate Ethics Committee could still impose a disciplinary penalty.
According to Ensign's lawyers, they were informed by the Justice Department that the investigations against Senator Ensign were discontinued and that there were no further charges on the matter.
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The verdict was a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department. In her opinion, there was sufficient evidence that Ensign disregarded the lobbying ban.
Interviews, emails and other documents first disclosed in the New York Times in October 2009 gave rise to the assumption that Ensign Douglas Hampton, one of his election workers, was helping to purchase lucrative assignments to buy his silence about an affair with Hampton's wife, Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton served as treasurer during an election campaign, Ensigns.
Ensign made contact with some political friends to make Hampton work. According to the documents and interrogations, he took over for them after hiring Hampton's lobbying.
Since Hampton was recently still on Ensign's election team, it was he was not allowed to take on any lobbying for his former employer or the entire Senate for a year.
According to ethics experts, the unusual agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, violated the so-called ban on revolving door lobbying.
According to the evidence published, "it appears to be an agreement and a violation of the revolving door statutes," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients who are in the government's sights.
While the Justice Department officially declined to announce the reasons for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. said. Brand and other ethics lawyers, the ministry seems very cautious in taking up political charges after a variety of defeats followed by the media with great interest, including last year's decision to drop the charges against former Senator Ted Stevens for misconduct on the part of the prosecutor.
Prosecutors "are obviously terrifying," said Melanie Sloan, the chairwoman of the "Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics Association in Washington" (an organization whose goal is to combat corruption in U.S. parliamentary and government circles), a group of lawyers who file various charges against Mr. Ensign took to court.
"That basically means that high-level government officials can now assume that the laws don't apply to them," she added.
Paul Coggins, chief defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that he had received a phone call from a prosecutor on Monday and another the next day in which he was told that the ministry would not file any lawsuits against his client.
Mr. Ensign's defense attorneys had been cooperating with prosecutors to convince them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, had "acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins declined to explain in more detail the legal arguments he had put forward to prosecutors.
"I'm not in the process of going into the conversation details between the Justice Department and me. Only so much is said: We think we have made the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to stop investigating a separate lawsuit by the ethics group, according to which a payment of $96,000 from Mr. Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated the federal election law.
The Electoral Commission said there had not been enough evidence that the money had been anything other than a gift.
NV Energy, a large Nevada company that for a long time supported the senator, was one of the companies where Mr. Hampton thanks to Mr.'s help Ensign lobbyist work found.
An December 2008 email proves that after the company Mr. Hampton has taken on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensing's chief of staff, John Lopez, a conversation with Mr. Hampton, in which he told him, had that he was "knocking" at the Home Office because of a cause.
Mr. Ensign was also with Mr. Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, arranged for lunch and asked the Transportation Secretary to schedule a meeting on behalf of the airline after those Mr. Hampton had hired for lobbying.
When information about this affair first came out to the public last year, Mr. apologized. Ensign among his constituents and gave up his position in the Senate, where he had stood fourth in the ranking of Republicans.
After many months of not being noticed, Mr. Ensign two weeks ago reporters, which he is seeking a third term in the Senate.
In the announcement that Mr. Ensign no longer the target of police investigations, explained his press secretary, Jennifer Cooper, the senator hopes that the ethics committee will very quickly follow the example of the Justice Department and stop his investigation.
"Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work in serving the people of Nevada," she said.
Cheshire appeal draws attention on Twitter
Half a dozen of them tipped away in the riots in the courtroom.
Every minute, they sent out their reports of grisly witness statements via Twitter.
In the end, according to the defense, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the trial over rape and bed-skewered children in a house that went up in flames.
On Thursday, the closely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was accused of killing three members of a family from Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end if the judge's verdict on the death sentence the jury pronounced falls.
But Mr. Haye's lawyers have already filed applications to the court, which set out reasons for an appeal and which will keep the courts busy for years to come.
One of the most provocative reasons is that the intensive coverage of the process - also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - has led to a "circus atmosphere" and such widespread, immediate penetration of riotous details, so that the jury was inadmissibly influenced by the public indignation.
This objection could prompt the appeals courts to deal with the question of whether the new technologies make new rules necessary in the courtroom.
"Just as I experienced during this process, I believe it is really a danger if the entry of the new technologies into the courtroom affects each individual's right to a fair trial," Thomas J said. Ullman, Mr. Haye's main defender.
The presiding judge, Jon C. Blue of the Supreme Court of Appeal, dismissed the motions by decision last week, briefly, when he said that the New Media would be "carefully controlled," and that there was no evidence that the jury had been driven by passions.
But that was certainly not the last word in this matter.
For decades, court objections have found that reporting on infamous cases raises doubts about the fairness of a trial.
In its historic 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court has the verdict against Dr. Sam Sheppard, a Cleveland osteopath who is said to have killed his wife, sold in his decision that there had been a "carnival atmosphere in the courtroom" because of the New Media.
Some believe that the television series and the feature film "On the Run" is based on this crime.
Some lawyers say court appeals, which Mr. Looking at Haye's conviction half a century later, the argument could follow that new rules have become necessary to the lines of communication from the courtroom, which at the time of the case Dr. Sheppard was still unimaginable to settle.
"There is a good reason to be concerned about the influence of the New Media in processes pursued by a broad public," John J said. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut. According to his report, it will be arbitrarily imposed.
Professor Donohue said some appeals courts might be intrigued by the idea that restricting immediate communication from the courtroom could make the trials fairer.
The Twitter matter is just one of many that the lawyers of Mr. Set out Hayes to discuss for years and thus delay a conviction.
The defense attorneys also claim, for example, that Mr. Hayes may have already been pre-convicted when Judge Blue had not allowed them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing them gruesome crime scene photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jurors have said photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and their digner, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, would have filled them with revulsion.
The defense lawyers say they would also question the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge mistakenly exchanged a juror who had been a critic of the prosecution, and that he had improperly put pressure on the verdict when he made the unusual decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jurors were not isolated.
Yet their arguments about the influence of the extensive coverage of the process attracts perhaps the greatest interest.
In a judgment contest they filed last month, they found that the case had dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed by the candidates during the election campaign for the governor's office and for the American Senate.
They argued that the New Media had continuously rekindled the flames of emotion over the case.
"Such a daily rush of media beepers, cameras and reporters outside the courtroom," the lawyers wrote, "have not been experienced before in New Haven and perhaps even nationwide."
Her focus on Twitter's reporting is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that this direct news was more inciting than reports, which are more slowly refunded, was a anti-tech view that suppled coverage of future processes.
Yet some lawyers said appeals courts were often confronted with the argument, social and technical changes would require adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayer's lawyers are reinforcing this claim.
In their objection, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision in which the conviction of Dr. Sheppard was lifted due to the coverage and made it clear that the New Media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21st century."
Can courtesy connect the divider?
After a campaign of swear words and negativity, little courtesy has broken out in Washington this week.
Is it the omen of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of illusion before you quickly return to the battle of the parties in the capital?
Tuesday's meeting between President Obama and top Congress did not bring a breakthrough on the big issues that had to be dealt with during the so-called "lame duck session," the session at the end of a government term in which no decisions are made.
After all that you hear, it was neither a polite discussion between two different sides nor a respect for their shared responsibility to govern, but rather a blank episode of a partisan point collecting.
The public meeting of the President's deficit commission on Wednesday was also civilized, despite the political differences that continue to exist between the members.
It seems clear that a close interaction over a period of months gives rise to mutual respect, obscuring the ideological divide that continues to separate members.
That's barely enough to claim it's a new era of cooperation has dawned.
Both sides are now in a testing phase - in which one demands from the other sign of cooperation and compromise, while trying to weigh the limits of public opinion and the patience of voters after a renewed party warfare.
Therefore, Tuesday's meeting itself and its assessment by the participants were limited to a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too big and too deep to be expected to quickly change the atmosphere that has prevailed over the past two years.
Whether it is taxes, donations, health or entitlements, the two sides are miles apart.
Last but not least, the November election has made Washington a mild vote for at least a short time.
"No question, the tone has changed," said Pete Wehner, an official representative of the Bush administration who now works for the "Ethics and Public Policy Center."
"This is inevitable after elections.
Elections create partisan passions that die again.
And that's a good thing."
On some issues, especially those that are on the agenda of the "lame duck session," Republicans and Democrats have little choice but to find a solution."
Bush's tax cuts end at the end of the year, and no one advocates that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or even all, whether it is temporary or permanent.
Likewise, a compromise on the increased unemployment benefits is to be expected, if only because Republicans cannot afford to believe that the favored tax cuts for the rich, while denying unemployment workers support.
After Tuesday's meeting at the White House, optimism has risen that one can agree on these issues during the "lame duck session" and at the same time ratify the New START Treaty.
Yet William Glaston of the Brookings Insitution warns that successful cooperation on urgent issues of the lame duck session" does not necessarily lead to permanent cooperation of the parties if the new 112. Congress will be convened in January.
Instead, he says, a phase of disagreement is more likely, perhaps even inevitable.
"After the things that need to be done are done, this short-term psychology will turn into confrontation," he said.
Wehner is also skeptical - and this skepticism is shared by many - which leads courtesy to true cooperation.
"I see a lot of what's happening from today until 2012, as a pre-fight, or shadow boxing, for the main event of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have much to do with the presentation of the new Republican majority in the White House and with the tea party voters who served their education.
How worried Republican leaders may also be about them pokering too high, they know they need to try to keep their promises to cut government spending and override health care reform.
These party lines are already clear in the first reactions to the recommendations of the deficit commission, which include a tax reform and the raising of some taxes, as well as the raising of the retirement age and the lowering of government expenditure.
Vice-chairmen Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, according to their own assessment, have pushed so much to put the deficit issue on the public agenda that these can no longer be ignored.
But they need 14 of the 18 votes within the Commission to make their plan the official recommendation and they are very much struggling to even get close to that number.
The greatest resistance can be found in the elected representatives of the panel, since there is little room for manoeuvre or little sympathy for compromise on financial issues, at least today.
Galston predicts two phases in the battle between the White House and Republicans in Congress.
The first fight will take place next year in the form of party clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama regarding the state budget, taxes and the health care system, later followed by a period of greater two-party cooperation.
What will lead to this change?
Public opinion.
It is proven that, despite the partiality of the current election, the majority of Americans still want the two parties to work together.
If confrontation leads to an impasse, as happened in 1995, then both parties must pay careful attention to the public reaction.
Whoever is condemned to lose will have to change course and seek the compromise.
This may indeed be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid-1990s, and they seem to be a larger ideological divide between Obama and the congressional Republicans than they were between President Bill Clinton and the Republicans at the time.
At the same time, the activists of both parties see 2010 as a pure prelude to a far more far-reaching election in 2012.
Seen in this way, the courtesy that is being displayed this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
But it will take much more effort on both sides to find a common denominator in the questions that still separate the two.
Leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as port of corruption
The city's control is in the hands of the "kleptocracy" and it passes on part of the bribes and the protection money it collects to the Kremlin. In February, the American Embassy in Russia reported in a memo.
Both the police and the state security service are extorting high protection money so they can maintain their expensive standard of living in Moscow, it says.
They raise money not only from legitimate business, but also from organized criminal gangs.
Every shift in the bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called a "vertical of authority" - takes his part from the money that the ladder is migrating upwards.
The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was released Tuesday by WikiLeaks on its homepage.
The memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it accuses him of corruption.
He was fired by President Dmitry Medvedev in October, but there is little evidence that in the meantime would have been cleaned up.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a well-known construction company, have repeatedly denied corruption allegations for years, and he has won numerous slander charges against such allegations.
In September, he explained to a Russian television station when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It's crazy, it's dirty, it's dirty."
> An incredibly large number of Russians believe their society is corrupt. That's what polls have revealed.
But it is unusual that, as happened in the ambassador's report, individual persons are named, and it is unheard that this is done by a diplomat of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the government of Moscow with crime has led to some calling it "disrupted" and to conclude that the government is acting more like a kleptocrat than a government," according to the memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "kryshna" (a term from the world of criminals / the Mafia, which literally means "roof" or protection), which extends over the police, the state security (FSB), the service supervisory authority (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor as well as through the entire Moscow government bureaucracy.
Professionals have discovered a three-layer structure within Moscow's criminal world.
"Luzhkov is paramount."
"FSB, MVD and the militia are on the second stage."
"Lastly, the ordinary criminals and the criminal inspectors follow at the lowest level."
"This is an incompetent system in which criminal groups close a gap in some areas because the city does not offer any help."
The report goes on to say that the FSB is cashing in money from the biggest firms and that police are arresting small businessmen.
One source, it is said, "explained that Moscow's business owners understand that it is best to get the protection from the MVD and FSB (and not from organized crime) because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than the criminals, but also because they are protected by the law."
"For this reason, protection by criminal gangs is no longer as in demand as it used to be."
The memo notes that while the raising of the funds is comprehensive, the protection itself is very modest not one; even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
Those who don't pay find their business closed very quickly - due to one or the other pretext.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but at the same time has noted that he has made little progress.
The message's memo contains descriptions of men going to the Kremlin with suitcases that were presumably full of money.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must rely on the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of Indem, a Moscow commission of experts, said in a recent interview.
"But he's part of that bureaucracy."
"It's not a part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without politicians, without an opposition, without a separation of the powers, he says, corruption is inevitable.
Nationwide, estimates Indem, corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
The country ranks 154th in a more recent investigation into the global perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparence International (countries are listed by "least corrupt" to "most corrupt").
The revelation of the memos of the American Embassy, which happened late after Moscow, will certainly cause displeasure within the Russian government, although, since Luzhkov can be accused for Moscow's mistakes, it may also be a way for the Kremlin to claim that one solves the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin claimed that the WikiLeaks documents could be a fake and reacted angrily to the revelation that American diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that it's about our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic politics in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we didn't expect this to happen with such arrogance, with such pressure and in such an unethical way, you know."
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront the past
In a dimly lit, concrete classroom with dirty and flaking walls, the director of Anlong Veng High School recalls the man who built it, to the later Khmer Rouge guide Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader and he took care of his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Because of his brutality during the Khmer Rouge rule known as "the butcher," the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals and bridges, developed infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
Yet this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, longtime supporters in Anlong Veng are being challenged.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to public confrontation with the people who once supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a textbook that for the first time tells children of former soldiers the story of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a UN and Cambodian community tribunal for the first time convicted a former member of the Khmer Rouge when it sentenced the former head of the infamous Tuol Sleng torture chamber, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these developments, fear grew among the Khmer Rouge veterans of Alnlong Veng, complicating their efforts to reconcile and reintegration into Cambodia's society.
"There is still rejection and fear in the former Khmer Rouge, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of Cambodia's Documentation Center, an independent organization that is exploring the regime.
"For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It divides even families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodia, between 1975 and 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or they died of disease, overwork or starvation.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-Ied government in 1979, the regime's remnants and its military fled to the border of Cambodia in Thailand.
Here they spread unrest until December 1998, when the last movement surrendered.
When Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary waged the guerrilla war from their base in the west of the mountains and jungles of Cambodia, Ta Mok drew the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, when a UN-funded peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge militants began to overrun the government, resulting in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died a natural death in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had not yielded, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek Mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in Phnom Penh prison, where he was awaiting trial.
When their patrons stopped protecting them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters fled into the grueling poverty of rural Cambodia and many kept the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though a few elite officials of the Khmer Rouge retained their local government posts because they laid down their weapons, the ordinary soldiers remained poor, uneducated peasants.
"These people have benefited very little from the surrender," said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng
"They are anchored in the utopian agricultural ideology of the regime."
"They grew up without any professional knowledge."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Rhmer Rouge in 1974 as a teenager, fought in the jungle for Anlang Veng before settling down in 1998 to lead a life as a poor rice farmer.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
"Ta Mok gave everyone something to eat."
"But now life is hard because we have to take care of ourselves."
The ongoing Khmer Rouge Tribunal has also raised concerns here.
Early next year, the court will try to bring Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister, to justice.
The order of the court is to condemn the old leaders and those who are principally responsible for the atrocities, but it is not said whether it will pursue further acts beyond these four cases.
That has done little to mitigate the fears in Anlong Veng.
Current media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who had been district chief in Manteay Meanchey province during the Khmer Rouge rule in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told commissioners of the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had led the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project in which thousands of forced laborers probably died.
On a hot evening, Im Chaem returned from work in the fields to her wooden house on a dirty road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun cast long shadows on the withered grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her past at the Khmer Rouge.
Should the court subpoena her, she would refuse to leave, she said.
"Cambodia lives in peace and in stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, there would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who fled the Khmer Rouge in 1878, has also repeatedly warned that the situation would become uncertain, would the court indict more suspects, although experts and historians are discussing this.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he said.
But confronting the past is what Cambodia needs to do to be able to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the Documentation Center.
"Reconciliation with the Khmer times means gathering the broken pieces," he said.
"It is our duty to put these broken parts together so that, like anything, can understand."
The center created the first government-approved textbook on the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "History of Democratic Cambodia."
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an appendix to the History Book for the Department of Education's High School, which contains fewer than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As is often the case in Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city's links to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new school book helps students understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted skeptically when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family rejects many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are suspicious because they are not sure how many people will be convicted by the court."
Such resistance makes the reconciliation process complex and complicated, Sok Leang said.
But the public forums, the textbook and the court are gradually gaining influence," he said.
The Khmer Rouge still has a powerful attraction here.
Up in the Dangrek mountains, a path overgrown by shrubs and dirty with plastic waste leads to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body had been burned here after his death in 1998 on a tire heap.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a mobile phone saleswoman by the side of the road, said she didn't know much about the man who had been burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and a lot of people here go to him to pray," she said.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday and later in the day she wanted to go to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she will put down a bush of ripe bananas - hoping he brings her happiness.
Belarus agrees to continue to accumulate weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, the government of Belarus announced on Wednesday that it will no longer collect highly enriched uranium, which is a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was announced in a joint statement following a meeting of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov in an additional article from the security summit.
The U.S. government had tried for years to convince Belarus to no longer collect highly enriched uranium and appeared to have hit a hurdle last spring.
But U.S. government officials told the Washington Post that two secret agreements with Belarus have been struck in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a Belarusian research institute.
That set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - according to an official employee who remains anonymous due to the sensitivity of the subject, about 500 pounds.
The deal appears to be one of the key findings of Obama's "Nuclear Security Summit of the 47 Nations" of April, which had ruled out Belarus.
And it was obviously good enough to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
"I was really excited about the fact that they want a seat on the Nuclear Safety Summit (from 2012)."
"This proves to me that it works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear safety.
Clinton called the agreement "a very significant, important move" by Belarus.
Obama promised in Prague in April 2009 to secure all precarious nuclear material within four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will be the seventh.
A dozen countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
At the time of Obama's nuclear security summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko has declared that the nation will never give up its uranium.
"How do highly enriched uranium retain - hundreds of kilos, which is fundamentally weapons-grade, and less enriched uranium," Lukashenko said at the time.
"This is our raw material... We're not going to make dirty bombs out of it and we're not going to sell it to anyone."
"We use it exclusively for research purposes, that's all."
Belarus nevertheless approached the US a few months ago when it indicated interest in meeting an agreement.
The first attempt to remove Belarus' uranium in October was particularly complicated because the material was slightly irradiated, officials say.
It was loaded into a special train that will be more than 1,300 miles to a Russian factory for storage and disposal for, officials say.
The second attempt was decided on Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the officials.
The U.S. government is paying $14 million for these efforts, with much of the money going into Belarusian research with weakly enriched uranium, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"This was extremely carefully coordinated and coordinated to build trust," which led to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, a representative of the Department of Energy working on global hazard reduction.
The James Martin Center for Non-Dispassage Studies estimates that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of gun-capable uranium this year, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus wants to dissolve its camp by 2012, according to the joint agreement.
Relations between Belarus and the US have been strained for years, primarily because of Lukashenko's harsh disregard for human rights.
But Wednesday's statement suggests a possible rapprochement.
"Welcoming the progress of these global security issues, the United States of America and Belarus announces that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue in improving bilateral relations and it is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
No objections by the Spanish government to CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners over Spanish territory to Guantánamo, according to a telegram from the U.S. ambassador to Madrid.
This is reflected in the documents unveiled by Wikileaks and forwarded to the daily newspaper "El País" (via cable). It is added that former Deputy Prime Minister María Teresa Fernández de la Vega called for the Spanish government to be informed "to prove that foreign aircraft flying over Spain are adequately monitored."
In June 2006, following the publication of a report by the Council of Europe indicting the aid to human rights practices in a Dozen countries, including Spain, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega discussed.
The deputy head of government admitted that the Council's report "met Zapatero in the offside" and reiterated that Spain had nothing to hide on this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
"They just want to be informed" so as not to be "unpreparedly surprised," Aguirre reports via cable.
The former foreign minister, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish government "does not want to pay much attention to this matter, even though the government has little influence, as it would be in the hands of the judges."
For his part, prosecutor Vicente González told the embassy in January 2007 that he would not seek judicial initiative to request the declassification of the documents from the Spanish intelligence headquarters (CNI) and the defense minister over the CIA flights.
"These reports do not contain any incriminating or sensitive information," the ambassador explained after a conversation with the prosecutor.
Even so, the U.S. was more concerned about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish prosecutor and German prosecutors" than about the declassified information provided by the CNI and the Ministry of Defense.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly handle between governments," Aguirre laments.
At a March 2007 lunch attended by the U.S. ambassador and Spanish interior minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges are insanely intent on their independence and would do what they deem appropriate," he has given instructions to his staff to "avoid inflated rhetorical comments to let the tension down."
The ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's approach to this matter.
"Despite its generally pro-American stance, our experience teaches us that the PP will not doubt it, pointing out that the government will tolerate or willfully ignore Zapatero's actions of the U.S. that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, capitalize, even if those revelations could have a negative impact on the U.S. government," he points out.
The child killer confesses she complained on the Internet about the "toilet" of motherhood.
The young woman spoke of the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terror in a Galician way"
Mónica Juanatey Fernández is "Muki" on the Internet.
Under this epithet, which she carries from an early age, she keeps in touch with a cousin and at least one friend. Both are from Noia, a village in La Coruña province where she was born.
The notices are from 2008.
To understand these, you have to know their love life, which the daily newspaper ABC reconstructs on the basis of witness statements of its family members.
The 30-year-old Galician woman entered into a relationship with Iván Túñez, an industrialist, in 1998.
She lasted a year.
Shortly after she broke up her relationship, it became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his alumni never had him perform a DNA analysis.
Shortly after, she entered into a different relationship.
The chosen one was Alberto, a young man from Lousame, a neighboring community.
She lived with him for a long time.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balearic Islands to look around the labour market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even accompanied her to Palma for a week.
But from the content of their messages, it can be concluded that their love affair broke up and they separated.
In March 2008, she is alone in Menorca and writes: "Alberto is very strange and angry because I came here to work."
"When I told him that, he thought it was good, but now, of course, he realizes what it means to be alone with the boy all day long and not be free to do and leave what he wants."
Later, she mentions a message she just received on her phone: "I want you to come back this month or send me an address to send you the boy."
She complains: "If he doesn't like the fact that I'm leaving the boy with my mother, I'll pick him up when I'm back."
In May, she talks of returning to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'll only stay there until the 19th because I have to introduce myself to a job on the 20th if I don't want to lose those."
She explains that she takes her firstborn with her when everything goes well.
"He'll be with the one he has to be with, that is, with me. Never in my life will I leave him with anyone except my mother," a dubious intention considering their bad relationship.
There will be another email in July.
When she writes these, it is assumed that the boy who came to the island on the 1st of the month and was allegedly murdered on the 10th is dead.
"On the one hand, César is satisfied, on the other hand not."
"On the one hand he is with me and the place he likes a bit, but on the other hand he has to go to school every day."
She is talking about moving to Mallorca.
"There he (the boy) will attend a summer course, so I have less expense for the nanny."
On the 17th: Memories and Complaining.
"A huge kiss from César asking me when you're coming."
Alberto says he sent me some video on the email. You see, if he wants, he'll find me, such a crap."
On the 30th, one more thing: "The boy is fine. He goes into a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Víctor, her current partner, there's one: "He's shooting me money ahead of me."
On the Internet, in anime and manga blogs, there are messages from her.
She even had her own blog in MySpace, which is now locked down, and in which she called herself "Muki, the prison releaser."
"Terror a la gallega (headline) ".
The last man who lived with her, a sworn hunting supervisor, declares to have remorse because he feels guilty.
He can't believe everything happened because she hadn't told him she was a single mother.
Mónica was transferred to Palma Provincial Prison yesterday by the Centre for Prisoners in Menorca.
The public defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the course of the matter, "and she had no intention of causing harm to the little one."
Previously, however, she had confessed to drowning César in the bathtub and stowing his body in a suitcase.
Defense and prosecutor's office requested a psychiatric evaluation.
Partido Popular won 4 seats in Congress and PSC lost 9
With the results of 28. In November, the PP could play a crucial role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and deputies in the last regional elections, the PP is already focusing on the parliamentary elections - brought forward or not. Their expectations are more than positive, because the number of votes this party scores in these elections is usually twice as high as that in the elections in Catalonia.
So the Catalan People's Party received 610,473 votes in the 2008 parliamentary elections, while that digit was only 316,222 in the 2006 regional elections.
Last Sunday, the PPC scored 384,091 votes.
If this rising tendency - result of the redirection of the PSC's share of votes and the retention of the PP's electorate - should continue, the PP's analysts predict that in the general election, the PPC could rise from 8 to 12 congressmen, while even CiU (it now has 10) would gain and the PSC would lose at least 9 MPs (out of 25).
These calculations demonstrate the fundamental importance of Catalonia for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People's Party, the ERC would lose an MP - currently it has three - while ICV could hold its MP or win one.
However, should the election calendar be maintained, the next date with the municipal elections falls in May 2011. Even then, the People's Party (PP) can be the tongue on the scales to put an end to socialist supremacy, namely in four provincial capitals and with its majority in the Barcelona City Council, one of the city administrations with the largest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Both the Nationalists and the People's Party agree that the PSC will lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists will neither achieve a majority nor draw on their traditional allies (ERC and ICV).
After the Republican debacle, it is not absurd for this party to lose its representation in Barcelona's local council, in which it would have to score 5% of the vote.
The PP, on the other hand, recorded an increase in its share of votes in the four provincial capitals and could become the decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced they can play the lead role in Tarragona's turnaround. There they had ruled in front of the current mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros, along with the PP.
En Lérida, the PP is only 500 votes behind the PSC. The mayor, Àngel Ros, maintains good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during the last election campaign they met several times.
The People’s Party has also recorded a significant increase in other important places, such as in Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is represented in 34 city administrations of Catalonia and aims to form lists in as many places as possible.
The Catalan cell provided Al Qaeda with thousands of passports
In addition to the seven arrests in Barcelona, there were three others in Thailand
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerians, arrested by the police of the Barcelona Police Department, formed the jihadist cell controlled from Thailand, the different Al Qaeda groups, including the "Movement to Liberate Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Lashkar e-Taiba" (Let) - the latter was the author of the attacks in Bombay, which in 2008 demanded 106 deaths
The Spanish interior minister attributes great importance to these investigations, which goes so far as to assure that "Operation Kampai" has "weakened" the Al Qaeda counterfeiting apparatus worldwide and thus "its ability to act".
The researchers assume that in the two years in which the cell was active in Catalonia, thousands of passports were sent to Thailand, where they were forged and then sent to the groups that made up the criminal galaxy Al Qaeda so that their "fighters" could cross the borders of European and other Western countries without penalty.
The uncovered cell is not the only one of the jihadist network that has been active in Europe. Therefore, in addition to the Thai investigative bodies, other European police units have also participated in the investigations. It cannot be ruled out that there will be similar attacks on the territory of the EU in the next few days as the one carried out in Barcelona last Tuesday.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested) another was carried out in Thailand, in which the Pakistanis Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested, as well as the Thai
They had run the cell established in Spain and other European countries from Bangkok.
The Catalan network - part of which had been nullified in 2009 - stole in particular tourist passports in accordance with the requirements of the so-called "International Islamic Front."
This means that the documents must be issued in the names of men aged 25 to 45 and still had to be valid for several years; they were not allowed to have visa stamps.
In research circles, it is underlined that until now no links could be established between those arrested in Catalonia and the assassination in Bombay, although the author of this assassination, "Lashkar e-Taiba", was one of the recipient groups of passports stolen in Spain and subsequently forged in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be remembered that a few days before the assassination of Catalonia, several thousand dollars had been sent by means of a money transfer company, which were "invested" in the purchase of prepaid cards for mobile phones, which were later used by the members of the "command" who put an end to the lives of 106 people.
Police have seized extensive documentation.
PP calls for Mas to postpone tax agreement
The chairwoman of the PPC, Alicia Sánchez-Camacho, yesterday took the opportunity to personally present Artur Mas with her terms and conditions in support of his taking office as Prime Minister of the Generalitat. These are no different from those already put in place during the election campaign and can be summed up with the primacy of economic recovery and the omission of regionalist independence adventures, such as a financial compensation agreement, which the regionalist leader wants to propose at the culmination of his mandate.
The leader of the Catalan People's Party certainly turned to Artur Mas, who gave her the 18 MPs she had won last Sunday - a digit more than sufficient to feel indispensable. Because the candidate from the bourgeois-regionalist party CiU is dependent on at least one of the opposition parties to abstain in the vote when he takes office.
The future alliances that the regionalists want to enter into in the upcoming parliamentary elections in Congress depend on a possible entent with the PP. The talks that Mas is currently having with the other party leaders, however, revolve around Catalonia.
As for the party leaders of the PPC, it demands that in support of the inauguration, "all discourses concerning the sovereignty and independence of Catalonia" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the state and the Autonomous Region - similar to the Basque Country - and which the party leader of CiU even wants to subject to a referendum, are employed at the back.
It is common to both political leaders that they want to slim up the exaggerated political apparatus of the regional administration and abolish the inheritance and gift tax.
The details of the negotiations on the taking-off of Mas are dealt with by the PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Mas has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who announced a tough opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he will meet with Joan Puigcercós (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The nursing home reaffirms that the deaths are not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the old people's home in Olot do not rule out that their caregiver killed over eleven elderly people
Those in charge of the La Caritat nursing home in Olot (Gerona) gave a press conference yesterday in which they highlighted the damage to the criminal actions of Joan Vila Dilmé - the nurse who had killed at least eleven old people he was responsible for during his work - inflicted on the facility.
The head of the nursing home, Joan Sala, appeared in court accompanied by his lawyer, Joan Cañada, and announced that "La Caritat would like to indict the person responsible (for the deaths)" but "the right and our liability force us to do so to accept the process and civil liability."
The institution must not only accept a social loss of reputation, because it had not determined the criminal acts of the caregiver in time, but now also pay a high amount of compensation, which is calculated by the legal representatives of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that he had continued to murder since.
The judge ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the aged care home - because he suspected that no doctor had personally examined the deceased, but the formalities were handled by telephone due to their age and illnesses.
The head of La Caritat roundly denied this point, explaining that "missing measures could not have been the reason for the incidents at time."
The La Caritat's lawyer added that "in the litigation there is no evidence of negligent acts of a person other than the accused."
The already baptized as a "angel of death" confessed to eleven murders the day before yesterday and declared, the first crime on 29. August 2009 and a month and a half later murdered the second old lady.
In this case, he killed insulin with an overdose, unlike the first crime in which he had administered a mixture of various sedatives.
The head of La Caritat explained that the staff's access to the drugs was difficult to control.
The insulin injections and the sedative cocktail put the nurse in six out of nine crimes committed to free the patients from their suffering with death.
But the results of the laboratory investigations will highlight whether Vila is lying and actually choosing a less cruel death for his first victims, or whether he burned them out from the inside by administering bleaching liquor to them, as he had done, according to the confession, in three women he had done between 12 and 17. October murdered.
In La Caritat, the statements of the nurse are not believed, not even in terms of the number of confessed murders, which could well be more. This attitude is thus justified by the fact that Vila had made very different statements in court and that it makes no sense to suddenly change his course of action after eight successful murders.
They say they made themselves available to the judiciary for this reason and to clarify the scope of these incidents.
European Central Bank (ECB) threatening gestures
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to the threat of ECB President Trichet, who warned "the markets should not underestimate our responsiveness."
The risk premiums of the euro-peripherals have risen dramatically and the shares of European banks by more than 5%.
Nevertheless, we should underestimate the possibility that the ECB can be wrong and that the euro has barely increased in points, which causes concern, not to underestimate.
The events of yesterday are typical of an illiquid market, which, to the extent that it collapses, but as a result of the closure of short and highly speculative positions.
The institutional investor is far from losing his fear.
A month ago today, the European Central Bank urged us to reverse our liquidity measures, according to which the ECB will have to back down for the fourth time in two years tomorrow, and probably several more times in the future.
The Bundesbank demanded the termination of the plan to buy sovereign debt, as they were ineffective, as well as the cancellation of all exceptional fixed-term liquidity measures. Only one-week permanent access should be maintained.
Following the Ireland crisis, we expect the current liquidity measures to be extended "at least until March" and the quarterly tenders with unlimited access at quarter-end to ensure liquidity will be maintained until at least June.
We also expect that the program to purchase bonds will continue and issue a strengthening signal.
If the expectations created are not met, the excellent reaction of yesterday’s markets will be thrown back again and if we insist that we take back our liquidity measures, only God can help us!
As well as at the ECB meeting in May, at which the bank reaffirmed not to consider buying sovereign debt securities and markets collapsed, that story could repeat itself tomorrow.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May, she showed her teeth and on Wednesday she said she had already bought a lot, which provoked a new collapse of the market.
Yesterday, the auction of one-year government titles in Portugal was quite weak.
State asset management spent only 500 million in 5.28%, up from 750 million to 4.81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, interest rates in Portugal fell by 30 basis points throughout the curve, reflecting a change in the perception of the markets according to Trichet.
In Ireland, the debt hole figures of Allied and Bank of Ireland were published.
The sum is estimated at about 10 000 million in the short term and possible another 15 000. There is time until February to raise private capital or these banks will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has completely lost its credibility after failing to recognise the problem with the stress tests in July, the figures under the rescue plan are acceptable and help reduce uncertainty.
However, the government must receive parliamentary approval for its new budget next Tuesday. Since it still does not have the sufficient support, Ireland remains a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has her discourse on the summit of heads of state and government on 14. December more moderately designed. There, political unity is required to show that together we play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the ninth symphony of Beethoven.
The Spanish President of the Government presented the plan of measures yesterday, which is to be adopted by the Council of Ministers on Friday.
Pension reform, transparency in the autonomous regions such as the financial institutions, reduction of the government deficit, liberalisation, privatisation and job creation measures. Measures that sound in the ears of investors like Vivaldi's Four Seasons.
The double effect of Zapatero and Trichet explains why the Spanish stock market has gained 4.5 percent, twice as much as the rest of the European stock exchanges.
Compared to February, the reaction from the government and the Spanish central bank was swift and convincing, and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a significant auction of a three-year government bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect. That is why we are counting on strong demand that will remove all doubts about our restrictive capacity.
For Spain, applying for an aid plan would be a self-sacrifice.
We would get liquidity that we don't need. The Treasury has 40 billion euros available, three times as much as in March. Interest rates are extremely expensive and access to the markets would be closed without notice.
Nevertheless, our strategy should correspond to Caesar's wife's motto: "Now not only the being counts, but also the appearance."
Just courage, we can do it!
At the request of his children, the Chairman of the Board of Management of Eulen will appeal to the shareholders’ meeting of Vega Sicilia
The storm in the open conflict of the Álvarez family, owner of the companies Eulen and El Enebro, does not slack off.
David Álvarez, founder of the corporate group, will appeal to the shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, which will take place at the request of five of his seven children on the 16th, as he considers them "absolutely void." His children will try to obtain a majority to control the management bodies of the company - owner of the Bodegas Vega Sicilia winery.
David Álvarez and his children Jesús David and María José are preparing the legal measures for a new judicial chapter in their dispute over the control of part of the group of companies.
The founder of the largest holding company for business services does not appear to be ready to give in in to his litigation over control of El Enebro's bodies.
He was driven out of the Board of Directors by five of his seven children. These were appointed at the shareholder meeting of 18. January of this year, which is already registered as contested in the Commercial Register, to members of the Board of Directors.
The shareholders' meeting of El Enebro, convened by the judge of the Commercial Court No. 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has triggered a new thunderclap in the lap of the Álvarez family.
Invoking the judge to allocate the meeting is the only legal path that ensures the convening of the shareholders’ meeting.
The last strategy of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Mezquiriz is interpreted by David Álvarez as a "desperate means of the applicants - his five children - in order to the annulled assembly of 18 by means of legal insensitivity, fraudulent machinations and abuse of rights. To have January acknowledged," as official spokespersons explain.
This reasoning is the basis for contesting the assembly in retrospect to declare it "absolutely void."
The same protagonists, who envelop themselves in discreet silence, tried unsuccessfully in June to convene a meeting by judicial means.
At El Enebro - asset company and holder of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets - David Álvarez's seven children control 100 percent of the capital.
On the other hand, according to family protocols, the founder of the service group demands the right of use of more than 51% of the capital.
That is the real background to the matter on which the judge has to decide in the hearing on the handling of the appeal for appeal, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull wins in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
The cars are improved in real time with software.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this exquisite universe of speed has been marked by surprises and successes.
Initially, no one paid attention to the newcomer and despite his steeply ascending career during the last season, everyone was betting on the Ferrari victory of Fernando Alonso in the final sprint last November.
Without wanting to reduce the skills of the German driver and world champion Sebastian Vettel or the performance of the engine of Renault, the "secret weapon", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put in the hands, and thus created a winning team, has become a legend.
In reality, this is powerful software for the simulation of processes that the German company launched in 2007 for purposes that are not related to car racing.
This computer science program, known as PLM, has been used to develop assembly chains in factories around the world, energy plants and high-precision instruments.
The purpose is to achieve a faithful reproduction or Simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid errors and unnecessary costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon's cameras, Sukhoi's aircraft and Nissan's most famous commercial vehicles.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens' industrial division, explains that with the use of this software in the Formula 1 factory Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time," the changes and improvements that are detected on the races and during the tests can design and execute.
Russwurm explains that in 1992, an average of ten technicians worked in the racing stables, who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements in a season.
Red Bull's team now employs 180 highly qualified young people. With powerful computer systems, they carry out analyses and all possible changes to the racing car.
The Siemens executive explained that the PLM software was able to analyze and improve all components of Red Bull's racing cars, with the exception of the engine for which only Renault is responsible.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality within less than 24 hours thanks to advanced production facilities and high-tech autoclaves.
The only limit set to this crazy technical perfectionism is the 40 million dollars that a Formula 1 team is allowed to spend on their races in a season.
Red Bull has built its high-tech factory for the development and manufacture of its racing cars in a location 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings in which visits - especially journalists - are severely limited.
Everything that happens there is Top Secret.
The workforce includes 580 people, including the two pilots, world champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bull's true Formula 1 - hero is undoubtedly the latest world champion Sebastian Vetell.
Behind the enormous technological resources that the energy drink manufacturer puts in the services of its participation on the race tracks, other protagonists hide, whose support is invaluable and whose reputation is zero.
The plant's technology chief, Steve Nevey, stresses that five years ago, it was still possible to say that progress in R&D for racing cars contributed 50 percent to victory and the drivers were in charge of the rest.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology accounts for 85 percent of success, while the contribution of the pilots is estimated at 15 percent.
Nevey acknowledges that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by IT, because they are "unpredictable gladiators."
HP will open twenty stores of its own with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated its first exclusive store in Barcelona yesterday in collaboration with its partner Ront Reyes.
It is the first of twenty stores of sales network, each with 80 to 100 square meters, which the Multi intends to open in Spain over the next two years.
The company agrees on this initiative with the existing 16 sales areas in multi-brand operations, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
HP España's vice-chairwoman, Helena Herrero, cited as an example the converted shop on the Gran Vía in Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom HP has been working for thirty years.
The North American group of companies intends to set up 200 sales outlets in Europe by 2010, including 20 branches in Spain.
The first were inaugurated last week in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Herrera did not want to reveal the upcoming reopenings, but did not rule out that Madrid could be the next target.
The vice-chairwoman, who is also head of HP Personal Systems, assured that the philosophy of opening the store is always the same. It relies on a local distributor with experience and industry knowledge.
The North American group of companies advises them and takes over the exclusive shop equipment (with interactive products to touch). In Europe, all stores will look the same.
HP is also responsible for the training of shop staff.
Helena Herrero said it was not a franchising system and emphasized that the exclusive sales outlet network would be intended to "optimize customer service and the advice of small and micro-enterprises when shopping and thereafter, even the packaging."
The store in Barcelona has a pioneer pilot program that solves the technical problems of the HP devices with warranty.
An online service establishes a connection to the technical headquarters in Maastricht (Holland).
"This way we can solve problems in ten minutes that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system was developed in particular for small and micro-enterprises as well as private customers, because the large companies already have their service contracts for technical customer service," Helena Herroro explained yesterday.
Sabadell wants to 'claw' his rival a million customers in three years
Banco Sabadell's executive board member, Jaime Guardiola, is more optimistic than other managers. He believes 2001 will be a tough year for the banks, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the debt war.
Even so, he foresees a slump in interest rate margins, which banks are trying to offset with increases in fees and the prices of loans.
Sabadell expects to capture one million private customers in three years - a still too existing subject.
Sabadell has found the way to exhaust the next three years, and thus survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will introduce a new three-year guideline in 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking public aid from the FROB, but also to increase the market share by one million private customers - 700 000, if you withdraw the customers that the bank will lose. That's the big challenge this bank faces, because so far it has paid more attention to its business customers than to its private customers.
This year it has added 250 000 private customers and 50 000 companies.
Their market share among private customers is 3.5 percent, while business customers account for more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the 2011-2013 business plan is to increase productivity, i.e. austerity, cost reduction. The challenges facing the bank will be presented together with the annual financial statements report.
Few banks dare to set and publish targets in these difficult times, as the financial crisis has messed up all the banks’ plans worldwide.
Sabadell will complete its Optima plan, which was set four years ago, this year. This was initially designed for three years, but as a result of the market situation, it was extended by one financial year.
The customers who will leave the savings banks are the main goal of the bank.
At a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 would be a "difficult" year "with long reach."
The manager assumes Spain would only "slowly" get out of the crisis.
Besides, it would be "very difficult" to "create work" in two or three years - fundamental to the survival of the banks.
Even if he assumes that the war over liabilities - which punishes the interest margins - will abate, the risk surcharges that banks and savings banks will have to pay for their issuances to obtain liquidity will already be passed on to the price of loans as compensation for dwindling profit margins.
"The issues of liquidity and financing are structural in nature and they will put pressure on the loans."
"We didn't turn off the tap, but the interest rate differentials are very high," Guardiola admitted.
Banesto already issued the order to its branch network on Thursday to restrict the granting of long-term loans and to increase the interest rate differential (cf. Cinco Días from 22 and 27. November).
The manager also admitted that the banks were currently pursuing the strategy of "increasing the fees" but "within a framework shaped by the competition".
Sabadell's leitplan is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not rule out corporate business.
It is not for nothing that he assures that in Spain "larger companies are necessary."
"Everything will change in the coming year," he assures.
He stresses that the demand for capital is currently "rising enormously" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institutions will slip into red numbers.
He is of the opinion that the FROB can replace the money market in the case of capital increases.
After reassuring that Sabadell could also survive a temporary closure of the markets, he invalidates the argument of some bankers who are already predicting a new liquidity crisis.
He emphasizes that nothing can be circulated, but in contrast to the incidents in June, short-term financing can be achieved via repo transactions and thus intercepted the crisis.
CECA rules out a second wave of mergers by savings banks
The director general of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, yesterday rejected the possibility that there could be a wave of mergers of the savings banks and emphasized the speed with which the industry will be restructured.
When the Spanish savings banks' concentration process began, several savings banks did not insist on participating in the first phase. They reserved the second round.
On the other hand, the general manager of the Spanish savings bank association (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured that this second round would not take place.
"I believe that most of the mergers have been completed. The inclusion of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered a second round, but rather adjustments."
"Most of it is complete. It may be that instead of seventeen or fourteen we have, but all the important processes are already complete. They were controlled by Banco de España, who strongly supported all the processes."
At a breakfast organised by the Association of Managing Directors and Managers of Aragon (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was "completed as soon as possible and that we must be satisfied with the timely expiration, the one in earlier times, not now, has been established as part of the business plans with Banco de España," he stressed.
"The transition from 45 savings banks with an average of 28 000 million assets to 17 with 75 500 million each is a historically incomparable process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and they are now much larger, with which we have fulfilled the Basel agreement," he highlighted.
Olavarrieta explained that "there were a number of indiscriminate opinions about the slowness of the process, the dubiousness and nonsensicality" revealed, because "Banco de España exhorts us to conclude on time before the end of the year."
The director general of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain had one of Europe's most rigorous financing systems and "perhaps" the whole world, adding that those who doubted this would do so "without any deeper knowledge."
The manager noted that we have to make "no worries" about the situation of financial institutions and savings banks in the current economic economy, which have gone through a "very significant" concentration process that will be carried out "as soon as possible."
He also recalled that Spanish banks had passed very well the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Zapatero and the red line of Germany
Berlin has opted for the retention of the euro, but at the same time set up conditions for the entire European Union.
The tensions in the markets have sparked a double response from the government.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero has presented new adjustment measures, ranging from tax reductions for small and micro-enterprises, the regulation of temporary employment, or the lifting of the 426 euros of support for the unemployed who do not receive unemployment benefits, to the privatization of 49 percent of AENA, the administration of the Barajas and El Prat airports, and 30 percent of the state lottery.
On the other hand, the deputy head of government, Elena Salgado, with the help of the former Prime Minister Felipe González, supports the criticism of the Chancellor Angela Merkel as responsible, who has summoned the current crisis.
How are these processes to be understood?
It is anticipated that Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her public relations.
On the contrary, it is a new round in the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
Germany occupies a fundamentally new perspective on shaping our future, which conflicts with the maintenance of the traditional traditions of a large part of its partners.
In view of the resistance in Europe, Germany is beginning to speculate about three possible ways out of the crisis.
The first: A strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries, while the south would have to leave the euro area.
The second: The reintroduction of the Deutsche Mark - although this currently sounds more like science fiction - , supported by a large part of public opinion, approx. 50% of the population.
The third: A transformation of the euro in accordance with German proposals. This means: more macroeconomic control; strict budgetary management; punishment of the countries that exceed the requirements; possibly the suspension of payments by some countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation measures to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has been emerging for some time. That's why there are no excuses now.
First in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission created incentives for deficits and the German government pulled a constitutional reform out of its sleeve to prevent this from 2016.
That was the first sign of drifting apart between what Germany felt was necessary (strict tax plans and stable public finances) and the practices of its European partners, including France.
The second sign was set by the Central European country when Merkel painfully postponed the decision to save Greece.
At the time, this was heavily criticised. But the fact is that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the published opinion were absolutely against a rescue of Greece.
Finally, Merkel comes out in the last days of October with a clear position. It calls for reform of the European Union's agreements to allow the rescue of a country while requiring private lenders to bear some of the costs.
This position was interpreted as anti-European as it drove the Irish crisis and everything following.
But their proposal, though somewhat sweetened, was adopted. In the coming months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will enable these measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that does not intend to cross it.
It tells everyone that - even if unpopular measures have to be taken now - there will no longer be the old functioning of the euro from this date.
2013 will be the birth year of a new currency area in which the infringing countries will be severely punished, forced to declare themselves insolvent and in this case the private sector will have to cover a portion of the costs.
Germany shows us that we have to take a hard growth course, with high savings and investment rates, moderation of consumption, improvement in productivity and competitiveness, and positive external balances.
The other alternative, which is based on debt and construction with huge holes in the balance of payments, as it was cited by Spain in boom times, simply will not be tolerated.
The offer is clear.
And we would do badly not to understand it.
It's not just about driving the government deficit down to three percent by 2013.
The demands are much tougher.
And the worst thing we could do in these conditions is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turmoil will turn into more calm.
And that we will take advantage of the opportunities we are offered by spring 2013.
It seems that Zapatero understood this as well, and his double announcement (the promised reforms after the discussion with the big companies last Saturday and the announcement of new measures from yesterday) points out that despite criticism of Merkel, the hypothesis of creating order in-house has paved its way.
But the red line drawn by Germany is there, and it doesn't look like anything would change about that.
Among the possibilities considered, the fact that we would have to leave the euro area, which is full of little serious countries, cannot be ruled out.
In this case, Germany could still tell us it has warned us.
Sport and rule circumvention
Tricks like those of Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax show inventiveness, but not the will to circumvent a sanction.
The allegedly instigated by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) exclusion in the match from 23. November against the Ajax in the Champions League caused a lot of ink to be spilled over whether it was an unsportsmanlike act or not and whether both players should possibly be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is generally known, the two players lost time a few minutes before the end of the game (their team had already clearly won) and played several fouls so that the referee showed them the second yellow card.
In this way, and since the Real Madrid would lead his group, the two players will meet the prescribed sanction in the next league game against the Auxerre and thus enter the next phase of the game without cards.
Finally, UEFA's disciplinary committee punished the club's coach, José Mourinho, with two games and the players involved with different amounts of money.
The provocation of a yellow card in such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more common in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos - the unwritten but followed in this sport rules.
Part of the debate surrounding the case presented goes back to the fact that a team from the Real Madrid football club (who, in his anthem, pretends nobleness and honor and on other occasions had punished his players for similar incidents) played the lead role in the process, and on the dramatization by Mourinho, who added an episode more to his long history as a theatrical and provocative technician.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this not explicitly prohibited by the statutes of conduct contradicts the principles of sport, that is, whether these actions constitute a rule circumvention. In fact, this approach adheres to the statutes of sport, but seems to circumvent its meaning.
In this matter, the damage caused to the sports spirit should be investigated.
The sports spirit defends the physical integrity of the opponents, an aspect that was not endangered by these actions, because it was not an aggressive game.
Another aspect of a clean game is to avoid the infringing players getting an unjustified benefit from the counterteam. That didn't happen either.
The paradox of the action of the players of the Real Madrid is that it does not correspond to what we usually mean by wrong play or bypass, because the circumvention of the rule was not carried out secretly in order to avoid a sanction, but it should be as conspicuous as possible so that it is punished by the referee.
The players waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage the indiscribes pulled out of the intentional fouls.
Here it should be emphasized that the rival was neither put in a less favorable position nor advantages for the game played were expected, because the obvious result of this action was that the own team had to continue playing with fewer players.
It is also not a useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The advantage is obviously that players start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game.
But it is a long-term, to a certain degree uncertain advantage, since the team could eventually also retire. In addition, players will receive a sanction with this procedure and move on to the second cycle of cards, in which they are eliminated less than in the first cycle because of card accumulation with one card.
This is not so clear whether it is really an advantage.
Ultimately, such practices are not directed against the spirit of sport, which also includes strategic decisions to make the greatest possible benefit from the regulations.
In this case, the players did not want to bypass a sanction (that would actually be a clear case of rule circumvention), they were more likely to choose when to undergo it.
They made a strategic decision without evading or fleeing from it without a penalty.
Although the boundary between inventiveness and the rule environment is blurred, I believe that this matter is a clear case of inventiveness.
I have the impression that the polemic was created as a result of two factors: because it was about two self-exclusions and because of the type of provoked rule transmission.
The harm inflicted on the principles of sport by these actions is less ethical than rather aesthetic.
Customer catch offer for group Christmas dinner in Barcelona
The dictatorship of the calendar this year leaves an avalanche of reservations to days 16 and 17. December falls.
The celebrations paid for by employees themselves are spreading. They don't want to spend more than 20 to 30 euros.
Like the Turrón and the Christmas lottery, there are also group dinners in the run-up to Christmas, which supply oxygen to the restaurant and leisure industry of Barcelona. But as a result of the economic crisis, they trigger a price offensive to capture the customer segment, which is the large mass,: Almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros for a lunch or dinner, confirm the surveyed entrepreneurs and associations.
So that the accounting becomes even more complicated, the calendar (New Year's Eve falls on a Friday) has all orders into the week of 13. dropping December, with the result of an avalanche of reservations from dinner to two peak-timers (the 16th and 17th) and almost no orders the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad times began, many companies have ceased group dinners for budget reasons.
In order not to have to give up on this tradition, many employees pay for it out of their own pocket.
However the economy is, low prices are demanded, confirms the chairman of the Barcelona restaurant committee, Gaietà Farràs.
The representative of the umbrella organization does not dare to predict until now what the holidays will look like this month.
"People think about it 'tweny times before they reserve.'"
"They would like to go out, but they pay close attention to the prices," he insists.
The business will go well with those "offering quality at good prices with a good service," he adds, and reminds us that customers save in times of crisis, which is why prices are in the most demand by 25 euros.
In a survey in various centrally located restaurants, it turns out that the evening of the 17th. December's providers lead to collapse.
The Soteras group says the demands for this Friday with the intention of spending less than 30 euros would boom. The group has adapted its menus with complete offers between 25 and 35 euros to the economic situation.
At another leading group, Andilana, which maintains 16 hospitality venues in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has led to early reservations, even from early November.
"We have made the impossible possible to maintain the previous year's prices with menus for every taste of 19.95 to 30 euros," he explains.
At AN Grup, which manages El Mussol, Attic, QuQu and a total of 23 locals, you do not lose the optimism, after the revenues have blossomed again since the second quarter and good, if focused on a few days, prospects for the Christmas business are looked forward.
Sources from the group of companies highlight that even the 18th will be an overactive day with groups of friends who pre-celebrate Christmas.
A Christmas menu for 30 euros or more as a price hit has been added to the six group menus. One has the impression that customers are willing to spend 10 percent more than in the previous year and in return want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, too, green sprouts can be seen sprouting, which is why the employees are invited again. This gives the impression that the group dinners are back on the upswing.
On the part of the umbrella organization Fecasarm (with mergers such as the pub, restaurant and leisure association of Barcelona), the deputy chairman, Enric Gomà, trusts to see the end of the tunnel and notices that the reservations are quite "lively" overall, although the customers "slap out a maximum."
However, the fun of celebrating has not declined, no matter who pays.
Pakistan's nuclear program is causing great concern in the US
Islamabad manufactures nuclear weapons "faster than any other country."
WikiLeaks revelations confirm relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the North American Embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department, revealed by the Internet portal Wikileaks, confirms the enormous concern of the Pakistani nuclear program Washington.
On the sidelines of the clarifying and hefty details that the documents on the content of the talks and the mindset of accredited North American diplomats in Islamabad provide, they reveal that cooperation between the two countries in terms of nuclear security is not strengthened, but on the contrary "detracts," and that the unstable Asian country produces more nuclear weapons "to a faster rhythm than any other country."
In particular, the peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that the weapons are not assembled, but their individual parts are stored to make their destruction more difficult in a possible attack - Washington is preparing sleepless nights.
The following risks count the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before the visit of the former head of the National Security Council, James Jones, to: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities to the area attacked by the Taliban, the presumed scattering of the nuclear material and the vulnerability to the transport of nuclear material."
The large number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is no longer seen as sprawling by the U.S., but also by Russia, and reason to exercise caution.
"Pakistan must hire strictly religious personnel to guard the nuclear facilities; due to the low level of education and cultural, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working on nuclear or missile programs," expert Yuri Korolev of the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a meeting with his North American counterparts.
New to the documentary, revealed by Julian Assange's internet portal, is that cooperation between the US and Pakistan in terms of nuclear distribution is waning and the increased pace at which Pakistan manufactures nuclear weapons.
In May, an office of the embassy describing communication with Pakistan as "frustrating" is declared: "There is often no transparency; we do not get answers to offers of help or they are rejected."
In another statement, Peter Lavoy, official of the state intelligence service for South Asia, confirms that "despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan is producing nuclear weapons as quickly as no other country."
Ambassador Patterson is asking Washington during a visit by the chief army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, to "clarify" to the person in charge that "Pakistan's army must cease its tacit support of terrorist groups."
On the hunt for Wikileak's boss
Obama appoints a high leader in the anti-terrorism struggle to prevent new revelations.
Interpol issues a red warning to the persecution and discovery of Assange.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Jullian Assange, is a complicated labyrinth in which the facts can be difficult to clarify.
Yesterday, Interpol issued a "red warning" to "find and persecute" Assange.
However, this is not a traditional order for arrest.
Besides, she's not new, she's from the 20. November.
It also has nothing to do with the last disclosure of over four million diplomatic documents from the US, but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian must face in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of the founder of WikiLeaks, Mark Stephens, assures, "the police know where and how to contact Mr. Assange."
Already on the 20th, the international police authority, based in Lyon (France), issued the order at the request of Sweden, but it was not announced until yesterday after receiving the authority by the Swedish authorities.
That's how things are. The 188 Interpol countries are instructed to identify and locate Assange "to temporarily arrest and extradite him."
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red warning, according to the organization, many member countries regard the red warning as a free pass for an arrest - which must be carried out by the national police - especially if they have a bilateral extradition treaty, as is the case of Sweden and England, where Assange is presumably staying.
The crackdown outraged Assange's lawyers, who gestured a letter informing them that the 39-year-old founder of WikiLeaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities via video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested the exit from Sweden and received the appropriate approval from the prosecutor, who is compared with the fabled Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, security chief of Stalin.
"This is like a hunt, not like a legal prosecution," the letter is charged.
While the world is looking for him - and his mother from Australia asserts her son's innocence - Assange is staying in an undisclosed place, but not silently.
On Monday, he gave an interview to the head of Time magazine via Skype from an indefinite location. At the meeting, he requested the resignation of the Secretary of State of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it can be proven that she was responsible for ordering North American diplomats to spy on the UN and thus violated international agreements signed by the US, it would have to resign," he said.
His opinion was condemned yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who described the request for resignation as "ridiculous and absurd."
"I'm not sure why we should value a guy's opinion with a website," he explained to CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a high-ranking figure for the anti-terrorism struggle, Rusell Travers, with preventing new document revelations.
The spokesman Barack Obama's attempt to pay less attention to Assange contrasts with the opinions that conservative politicians and commentators are proclaiming these days.
Congressman Peter King, who will chair the House of Representatives' National Security Committee from January, has called on the State Department to investigate the possibility of putting Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations "to seize their funds and to pursue anyone who supports them or makes a contribution."
Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, had gone even further, and he had to recant his statement that Assange would have to be "murdered."
"Obama would have to turn him into a target and use a non-manned plane or something like that."
Whoever did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former governor of Arkansas and possible presidential candidate.
"Whoever it was, who leaked information in government, he is guilty of treason and all that is not execution is a too mild punishment," he explained to Fox.
Puigcercós seeks peace in the ERC with a wink to the Carod
The Republican leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued existence in office.
Huguet proposes a more pluralistic government and the end of the general assembly principle.
Joan Puigcercós appears to have found a prescription to avoid for the tenth time an internal turmoil in the ranks of the directionless ERC after losing 11 MPs and half the electoral votes.
The party chairman is aware that his resignation threat is not enough for the close ones of former party leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira. But he also knows that the influence of this sector today is as weakened as their mentor himself and will not give him the same headache as other former currents.
That's why the leader of Esquerra is trying to win the new critics with a wink, which would secure his position until the next local elections.
For the beginning, yesterday announced that the more than 200 regional council members of ERC could secretly comment on his stay in office.
With ballot papers, not with an upscale hand.
If the carodists wanted to give the president a ticket, they could do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the boss wants to avoid both the impression of division and that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he reiterated that he would feel unvinced with half of the votes plus one, and he added without indication of percentages, a result "in the Bulgarian style" would also not be good.
The Carod-affected are demanding from the president more than just making his office available to the party. An inadequate gesture, as Puigcercós controls the supreme organ of the congresses.
But since they do not have a sufficient majority to push for resignations, they will agree with the board a plan of action from now until May.
To this end, they expect to be able to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic reorientation that the management will submit to the Council for a vote on the 18th.
Their intention is to vouch for Puigcercós. In return, this is to promise to move the congress to the autumn of 2011, which the party leadership already considers a fact.
The party chairman of the ERC is of the opinion that the "polyphony" is a pity of stability and he strives once and for all to enable the organization to wash its dirty laundry behind closed doors.
In this sense, the article signed by the incumbent conseller Josep Huguet in his blog is symptomatic.
Given that which Puigcercós is an ideologue, the holder of Innovació considered it a fact that the party chairman would be backed "in exchange for various goals."
He listed five, two of which are in the foreground.
First, the "restructuring" of the board, so that it represents at least 90 percent of the party members, that is, the inclusion of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC should finally abandon the principle of the General Assembly as a function.
In doing so, he is championing a reform of the statutes, which should make it possible to hold the congresses with elected delegates.
From the end of the general assembly model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós's team, which was already fighting for it at the last two congresses, as obsessed.
In fact, at the quaking 2008 assembly, the party leadership was tasked with reviewing the general assembly principle at a congress that was to deal with the reform of the statutes.
This date is still pending, since infogle did not recommend the internal restlessness of recent years to address this matter.
Now, without the critical sector lying in wait, the time may have come to take up this matter again and conclude it forever.

According to MILENIO's count, four fewer cases were recorded in México than in 2010.

Next to him, police found a cardboard with a message.
China maintains its greenhouse gas reduction targets
Speaking at COP16, China's representative stated that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce carbon traces and that it would maintain its supply to reduce 40 to 45 percent of its greenhouse gases by 2020.
China is keeping its supply to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country's representative at COP16, assures.
At his first public appearance on the 16th United Nations (COP16) climate summit assured Su Wei that his country had made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprints and change its industry.
He explained that over the past four years, his country has invested 245 million dollars to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases.
On the other hand, he explained that China would not change its goals, but would work together with the international community on this matter.
He explained that the Chinese strategy on climate change is divided into four aspects: dialogue, capacity building, institution-building and support for pilot programmes.
Progress has been made in all aspects, including the adoption of a new energy law last year, which includes the objectives of reducing the emission of gases, he said.
On the other hand, he emphasized that in China, the state authorities had worked with those of the central state and the municipalities to achieve the energy saving targets, effective use of energy and the reduction of emissions.
He also stated that several years of plans have already been embarked on or completed, both those financed by the Chinese government and those who received funds from other countries.
For example, he was referring to the Energy Effective Use Program, which had been introduced over the past five years and had received United Nations (UN) investment, the government and private hands.
There is also a project at the provincial level on climate change, another to exchange the traditional light bulbs by energy-saving bulbs and another to weaken and adapt, he explained.
Martin Krol, a scientific government adviser on climate change in this country, confirmed that China's efforts were far greater than commonly thought.
He pointed out that the per capita emission of greenhouse gases in China was six tons per person, while in the United States it was 100 tons. China is responsible for a nine percent total contribution to pollution.
It is also making unprecedented progress in the field of energy use. Energy effectiveness has been increased by twenty percent in the last five years and another is to happen by 2020, he explained.
Legal exclusion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN stated that the former panistic party chairman had the right to turn to the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right was entitled to him.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former party chairman of the PAN had the right to contact the National Commission of Order and to demand what the right granted to him.
In an interview that took place before the complaint Gabino Cué Monteagudos as governor of the state, he explained that the exclusion of Espino was a decision that had been made at the local level.
"This is an independent decision of the Commission of Order in Sonora."
"Mr Espino has the right, in his case, to contact the Comisión de Orden del Consejo Nacional via the way of appeal so that a decision is taken by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained, it was not time to think about 2012 and that an alliance with the presidential candidate had never sat at the negotiating table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that Acción Nacional strengthened from the internal vote on the coming 4th and 5. December, at which his successor is elected, emerged.
"That (an alliance in 2012) is an issue that has never been on the negotiating table, at least not until now. It was a proposition for the municipal election, he was successful and served his purpose," he said.
The panistic leader explained that the PAN looks back on 71 years of dialogue, so "the internal competition does not scare us; on the contrary, "we enjoy it and it strengthens us," he commented.
He said that the Council would undoubtedly select the or best chairwoman Acción Nacional needs for the next three years. That is why he would hand over the relay "to the one that the council would determine."
"I'm completely unconcerned and open. I would be proud to transfer the office of party chairman to each of the five.”
He predicted that in the last elections of 4. July saw the upswing of the party will be reflected in the next election, although "it is not time to think about 2012."
"Now it's about supporting Governor Gabino Cué in his task."
In this context, he highlighted that the three governments emerging from alliances between Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa would carry the flag and be observed across the country. That's why "a lot of hopes and longings are placed in them and I'm sure Gabino is at the height of the demands."
When questioned about the PRI's criticism of President Felipe Calderón over his disc course as part of his four-year government, César Nava called on the PRI's supporters to reflect on the six-year period of former Presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, should they start defending them should they finally come out of the closet," he affirmed.
He is of the opinion that the owner of the federal government expresses such as that he can make in his discourse in the Auditorio Nacional, because in this country there would be no ban on mouth and even less censorship.
Obama is campaigning in Twitter for the law in favor of undocumented students
"If you are in favor of passing the Dream Act law, then call your senators and urge passage of this law," the president of the United States tweeted on the popular social network.
President Barack Obama today supported the nationwide mobilization in support of the Dream Act - Law on the Legalization of Undocumented Students with a message on his personal blog on the social network Twitter.
"If you're in favor of passing the Dream Act - law, then call your senators and urge passage of this law," Obama tweeted.
His briefing includes a cyberlink to a more extensive document calling on the public to make understandable contact with their senators as the vote of the law is imminent.
"With your voice waiting for, the time has come to listen to you," he insists.
The news was circulated after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block all votes for any law, except the expansion of tax reductions from the times of Bush and the government's funding would be expanded.
Such a blockade, announced on a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could impact the vote of the Dream Act - law and other projects such as ratifying the new START agreement with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Questioned about the blockade of the Republicans of the Dream Act and other projects, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said he trusts that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable for the remaining projects can be set.
"I think we still have a lot of time..."
"All of us agree that the tax matter must be settled before the end of the year..."
"I believe that we can make an agreement on this at any time and after that we can plan the expiration of the rest," he said.
Democratic Majority Chairman Harry Reid announced Tuesday that "he would request the vote at the end of the debate" so that the Dream Act law, with which the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate from next Thursday, though next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act or the Law of the American Dream would legalize approximately 800 000 young people who immigrated to the United States when they were not yet sixteen years old, while the last five years have lived in that country and are enrolled at a higher educational institution or in the Army.
But the law's advocates need sixty votes to pass the initiative, which is why they rely on the votes of a handful of Republicans. Currently, the organizations of the advocates of this project are organizing an intensive influence on the adoption of the law.
The Democrats, the majority of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, said he would vote against and only one Republican, Richard Lugar of Indiana, has announced his support of the bill.
That's why Dream Act defenders must get several Republicans on their side should other Democrats choose to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are those from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Florida Senator George Lemieux, who took over the mandate from Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republicans who have supported the Dream Act in the past include Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but they declared they would no longer support it on any other occasion.
Another Republican who had spoken out in favor of the law, John McCain, has yet to set his stance.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, the analysts agree that the Dream Act in the Senate faces the biggest obstacles.
Put your finger in the wound with literature
The second round of 'The Lust for Language' was a walk in which the participants stood up for the narrative
"I understand the sex in the language, but... The finger in the wound? What is expected of me?" asked writer Luisa Valenzuela, who was to open the second round of 'Los placeres de la lengua', a cycle that celebrated Spanish-language literature and on this occasion used the subtitle of her question (at another event the round table was dedicated to sex in the language, she explained).
The finger in the wound... "brings us into trouble," the Argentine scriptor sweetly spit to the audience, which was composed mainly of young people who came together at the International Book Fair in Guadalajara (FIL) to attend this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz, attended by Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garcí
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio, and after which Shultz marked as a great narrative. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for it to learn what is a "wound" and goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she receives no answer, but clues for the guide of her narrative.
She leaves the infectious logist with conviction: "Patience is not my strength, maybe that's my wound."
Finally, after a frustrating approach to the traumatologist, who took her breath away in the middle of the corridor, and who explains to her that wound is not a scientific term, the psychoanalyst reveals the secret: "the wound is the really open, the symbolic is the scar."
The main character of the narrative sighs in relief and concludes that she "only learned from the wound that it was really open and does not exist." But she is convinced that the desire for the language and its traps mix.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented an adorable narrative, which he called 'praise of the invention', and in which the finger in the wound is not mentioned, but discovered.
With allusions to magical realism, he tells of a famous sorceress who touched the clouds, brought back well-traveled men, or restored the virtue lost by a girl. The narrative made a U-turn and reported on America, the great novel that was not lacking in its own chroniclers from the beginning, and he quoted Bernal Díaz del Castillo, who criticizes the abundance of stories told by the conquerors.
"Cervantes, who invited all of us (the writers), scoffed at the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories depicted as true, but in another way, the story of America would never have been told - with imagination that even lost the feeling of shame."
However, he emphasizes, "it is the madmen and liars who best imagine things," and there reality and lies approach each other, where one no longer knows to which side the narrative belongs, where fictional literature reaches the summit.
He actually calls this the 'tradition Cervantes'.
"From him we inherited from being what is being told."
When it was Mayra Montero's turn, the writer commented and praised the variety of interpretations to which the FIl's invitation to the round table 'The Finger in the Wound' had contributed.
The Cuban and Puerto Rican devoted her contribution to the great wound of social violence that befalls her country - like all of Latin America - as a result of the fighting over the drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs contain a tacit, not intentionally planned commitment," she explained, after highlighting that literature is communication and commitment that build up between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction."
The evening was decided by the Spanish poet Luis García Montero, whose contribution also highlighted "this finger of the dedicated writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a fast-paced world, even the intellectual habits and control of consciousness boil down to dogmatisms, and will forget "that behind every confirmation is a little no and behind every denial a little yes."
"To be in possession our thoughts and reality, we must nuance: And nuancing often means putting your finger in the wound and harassing those who feel much more comfortable when they think in the form of caricatures, in black and white, in pre-made ideas without nuances, and also to harass the powerful, who prefer to divide the world into black and white
Romano is fighting for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duel between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the endgame, two different styles prescribed by their respective coaches are also opposite each other, and their encounter, characterized by opposites, is reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks back on three defeats in finals, he has experienced ups and downs in his career, but three times he has had decisive games, and so far he has held up well, which is why this opportunity is of very special importance to him.
The Argentine has played his way up to the second champion with the medal, he has been one step behind the winners and surprisingly he has played successive finals with the same team.
The santistic strategist reached the first final as coach at the 'Torneo Apertura 2002', when del Morelia had the reins in his hand, with which he experienced a great defeat against Toluca with 4-2; later, in the 'Clausura 2003' he reached the decisive duel, which he also lost to Rayados with 3-1.
Already with Santos Laguna on the 'Torneo Bicentenario 2010', in which they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to take a setback again, as the game went out with 2-2 against Los Choriceros after 210 minutes of play undecided, but on the penalty he came forward with 3-1 and got two opportunities to pocket his title, but ultimately three of his players missed the eleven steps and the game turned
Rubén had already lost two finals with the Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, his great rival. Therefore, he does not want to be pursued again by misfortune and free himself from the evil spell in order to be able to celebrate a title for the first time, although he affirms that for him the most important thing is the game itself.
"I want to be champion, I don't want to break a statistic, that's for a club, for my affection, which I give myself to, and that's why the title will come to me, but what happens before is the most important thing," the helmsman commented when asked about the lost endgames.
The last final match has remained strong in his memory, he assures him to have learned a lot from it: "The only lesson we can draw from it is that until the referee does not whistle the end, we can not celebrate, we are prepared at the line, the players are also, because the last time we were already prepared to retire with two penalties, and I believe that is a lesson until the game is not finished
Knowing that this series could be decided by penalty shootouts does not worry him, because he trusts his players: "You never want to arrive at the penalty shootout, you want to finish in the regular season, but sometimes there is no alternative and you have to be prepared for it, in the previous tour we were prepared, but unfortunately the fate prepared us a bad game, sometimes because of nervousness or the fierce questwill come."
It is in Romanso power not to be only second champion anymore and to taste for the first time the fame that the titles bring.
The U.S. is changing the rules for obtaining a visa
People must present themselves to the visa application services department before they are interviewed at the consulate; this will reduce waiting times.
From the 10. In January 2011, the procedures for applying for a visa in the United States Embassy and in the consulates are changing.
In the new procedure, most applicants must present themselves to the visa application services agencies (ASC, the initial letters) before their conversation in the consulate.
The personnel of the ASC shall record the biometric data of the applicant, which will be reviewed by the consulate before the interview.
The new method has certain advantages for the aspirants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa decreases, because it is no longer necessary to pay separately the appointment, the processing of the visa application and the transport service with which the document is handed out.
The applicant makes only a single payment covering the three services.
The current price remains unchanged: the equivalent of 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for visas with application (including visas for temporary workers) and 390 dollars for hands and investors.
Those who only want to renew their visa do not have to have a conversation in the consulate, they only have to introduce themselves to the nearest ASC, where they will present their documents and their fingerprints will be taken.
Since the biometric data is collected in the ASC, the applicants who need a second appointment for the conversation in the consulate remain there less time than before.
Those applying for the visa in the consulates of Ciudad Juárez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer have to pay the service surcharge of 26 dollars.
Additional information about the new visa application procedure can be found in the following website: http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQs.html
NASA announces the find of alien life
The North American Space Agency convened a press conference to present a find tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living things in space.
The United States National Aerospace Agency (NASA) announces an astrobiological discovery tomorrow, Thursday that could confirm the theory of the existence of alien life.
The find will be presented by experts at astrobiology experts at 1pm tomorrow at a news conference at NASA's headquarters in Washington. This is a science that examines the origin, development, distribution and future of life in the universe.
When convening the press conference, NASA assured that it would present "a prudential find for the search for alien life," sparking speculation among experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that in hostile environments that previously thought were uninhabitable, human-like creatures could exist. It was raised the hypothesis that these could turn into intelligent living beings - just like humans - if their living conditions improved.
Apparently it's a microbe found on the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California. She lives there in an environment that was considered too toxic to all conceivable life forms, since the lake is heavily arsenic.
In some way, the microbie uses arsenic as a survival resource. Taking this ability into account, the chances of there being similar lives on other planets that do not have our protective atmosphere increase.
If these organisms metabolize arsenic, according to the astrobiologists, it is proven that "there is actually a different life form, a second life form, which is different from the one known to us."
The space agency announces the actual reach of its find tomorrow, on Thursday, at the press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who is studying the possibility of life on Mars, and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists, who studies Titan (the largest moon in Saturn) on the question of whether its chemical composition resembles that of the Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergencia and Patrón form an opposition bloc
With the reform of the organ law on Congress, the two-party system will be introduced, they lament.
Just had the 60. Legislative term began, and an opposition bloc, led by the MPs of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesús Manuel Patrón Montalvo, was already installed, who introduced himself as an independent. The four questioned the following: the entry of the 'two-party system' into the chamber.
Before the start of the introductory session in 60. The legislative term was judged by Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo of the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organ law, as they would be excluded.
With this reform, they repeated, a 'two-party system' would be introduced, because now it would be two people, the same number as parties that controlled Congress.
These four MPs, along with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the bureau, led by the panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his capacity as deputy chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political fringe position with these reforms.
He explained that in the next few days they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme. In doing so, they proceeded from their political will and if they did not have it, they would be subjugated again by both parties, thus putting an end to the opposition coalition.
"Up to this point I (the opposition coalition), that is what I see, because we are excluded from all decisions, they do not even take into account the opinion of the rest."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodríguez of Convergencia explained that there were agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that a pluralistic group would therefore be formed.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that after being monopolistic, Congress is now supposed to be "duopolistic."
"It is not the spirit of legislative reform that there is supposed to be an eternal two-party system in Congress."
"For starters, this group begins with five MPs and they are talking to other colleagues so that they become more," the Convergencia member explained.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza of the PT stated in reference to PAN and PRI that Congress has currently turned into a 'loot' for two.
"Before, it was just a party, now they split it up in two."
Patrón Montalvo requested that the honourable Members be respected and assigned their place at the negotiating tables.
"There must not be five out of it because of top decisions, which are likely to be nine MPs. The five, currently seen as divided into different political groups, have decided to unite to take our place at the negotiating table, because because of the reform carried out and agreed by the others, we have stayed out and we do not agree with this reform."
200 000 more peso for "the supplier"
The municipality of Mazatlán pays another cheque to the controversial owner of the company for electrical materials.
Another cheque for just over 200 000 peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city government.
Thus, the sum paid in the second half of the year to the owner of the company for electrical material is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the city administration, this cheque issued to an amount of 200,144.56 peso with the number 9258447 was issued on the past 16. November issued with the purpose "Billing open invoices".
Treasurer Luis Miguel López Moreno had already sent ahead that more money would go from the municipality to this supplier. It is observed by the Auditoría Superior del Estado because it sells at inflated prices.
What has not been mentioned is the total amount still owed to her and, as a result, the number of checks still issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought from her, it's just the debt paid, just like with the rest of the suppliers," he said in an interview.
The last checks "suffered" "back on" in the last quarter of the year: 24. September, two of 15. October, 19. October, 29. October and this last of the 16th November.
Although the supplier has not yet been published in the Official Journal, as required by law, if a company is challenged by the ASE to avoid other administrations requesting its services, the treasurer assured that their services would not be used again.
After the newspaper Noroeste on 25. July the examination of the cheques issued by the city administration to its suppliers was announced that it had already been announced before, from March 2008 to the 9th. July 2010 during the three-year term of Mayor Jorge Abel López Sánchez, the municipality had paid over 10 million pesos with 42 cheques to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also deals with Jumapam, where she collected checks worth over 3 million pesos.
Tourist places need to be improved urgently
Tourist companies regret the accident of the foreign tourist due to the poor condition of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist into the break-in of the Glorieta Sánchez Taboada, the tourism industry of Mazatlán applied to the authorities to pay special attention to the areas that are in poor condition and cast a bad picture on the port city.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, chairman of the Zona Dorada merchants' association, recalled that on different occasions it was called upon to maintain the destination and to turn the bad conditions that tourists face into new employment opportunities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks had had a negative effect, as the tourists would be strolling and see the clutter, after which they would turn their backs on the nearby shops.
"Politicians don't know what it means to have to close a company one day and they don't worry about how much money you lose. Otherwise, they would not carry out the construction work in this way slowly and without a plan."
Hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said the tourist's fall had drawn attention to the lack of prevention and lack of maintenance work on the part of the city.
"The community must take on its responsibility and avoid that something like this happens again. How is she supposed to do that? Well, by providing preventive maintenance instead of repairing everything in retrospect," he explained.
"We are eagerly waiting to have a clean city. Because not only because it is a tourist area, it must be maintained, we residents also have a right to a clean living space. The city council needs to change its strategy to keep the city in good condition."
"There are other places that also look unkempt and unfinished," he said, "for example, el Escudo y el Venadito of Mazatlán."
"Today we need more than just advertising to attract tourists. A good product must be offered, a city that keeps its beaches and streets clean, and the tourist attractions constantly in shot," he added.
"Not enough attention has been paid to these precautions and these kinds of incidents expose what is evident to all: maintenance is urgently needed."
Raúl Llera Martínez, under-secretary of Promoción Turística, expressed the importance of saving the tourist places of Mazatlán, because they were not used properly and created a bad picture.
He mentioned a number of places that would have to be brought to the fore along with the city. Making the city clean, tidy and attractive for tourism should be a priority.
"Fortunately, Mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites that would first have to be cleaned up and cleaned to make them attractive for tourism and to supply them to the inventory with which we advertise this destination.
IP calls for results from Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE, suggested that MPs should take the great responsibility to set a role model for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
The corporate industry of Mazatlán calls for a dignified parliament, free from collusion between the parties and the government, because Sinaloa is agitated and faces major problems.
Yesterday, the 60. Parliament inaugurated. It is made up of seven political forces, 19 PRI MPs, 13 from PAN, three from Partido Nueva Alianza, two from PRD, one from PT, one from Convergencia and one from PVEM. That makes a total of 40 people's representatives.
The new members of the State Congress are expected to do a clean job, to be committed to society and to the different social groups that rely on responsible parliamentary work, and that the same patterns of partisanship and paternalism will not be repeated.
Eduardo Dávalos, chairman of the CCE business coordination council, suggested that the new MPs should take on the great responsibility to set a role model for a better Sinaloa facing many challenges.
"We hope that the MPs will really exercise their right to act free from collusion between the parties, because it is common for them to reach agreements with which they represent their own interests, thereby transforming themselves into carnival comparses of the rulers and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that they should demonstrate their commitment to building the necessary bridges to support the current government.
"We care that they carry out a trustworthy job and, above all, stand up for society and its groups, because it was the inhabitants of Sinaloa who expressed their trust in them in the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, chairman of the Tres Islas hotel association, thinks that one of the great challenges facing the 40 people’s representatives is the drive and joint work for the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is extremely complicated.
"The most important thing is that they drive economic growth, create investment incentives and infrastructure measures, which will in any way promote job creation."
With regard to the tourism industry, he called on the new MPs to assign the necessary status in the state budget to the Ministry of Tourism in order to promote them.
"I understood that it is the ministry with the second fewest means. This is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings foreign exchange and investment to the country and is in direct competition with the agro-industry."
The tourist projects must be allocated funds, state security must be supported and the Alcohol Act, which has not been recast in previous legislative periods, must be brought up to date.
Holy King is wanted
The children of the Coronado Valenzuela family want dolls, cars, bicycles and other toys.
For the parents, it will be difficult to fulfill these wishes on the next Epiphany, because the household is no more and no less than twelve people and a goat.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesús, José Alfredo, María Guadalupe, Isaías, José Juan and Miguel do not give up hope that Melchior, Caspar and Balthasar will give them the toys and garments they so long for.
The family lives in a modest house in the settlement of Salvador Allende. They live from hand to mouth, for the father has no solid work.
"Sometimes hard times are called for because my husband doesn't have a job. But we sell mandarins and potatoes... Already in the afternoon I go with the brats to sell on the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Four-year-old Adelaida would like to have a doll or a bicycle, while her three-year-old sister Isabel wants a Barbie doll.
Ten-year-old José Alfredo has been wanting to have a 'monster car' for some time and for his eight-month-old brother Jesús, Cayetana proposes clothes in size for one-year-olds.
" (José Alfredo) told me, 'I'd love to have this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let's wait and see, boy,' because it was very expensive," Cayetana recalled sadly.
For the older children who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Eleven-year-old María Guadalupe is size 12; ten-year-old Isaías is size 10, while eight-year-old Miguel is size 8.
14-year-old José Juan is missing tennis shoes. A pair in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help to realize the dreams of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family, you can participate in the campaign 'Holy King is wanted' by donating a toy or cash in the reception hall of the newspaper Noroeste.
14 suspected drug dealers arrested
On Wednesday, the destruction of a production and sales network of cannabis around the ten house searches in the administrative region of Estria was carried out.
Fourteen people were arrested and will be faced with various charges.
The house searches took place in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, where they were said to have mainly used drug production.
"Approximately 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, cash and equipment that have served the production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman for Quebec's security police, said in a statement.
A total of eleven men and three women were arrested, two of the men considered the main masterminds of the drug ring to be from Sherbrooke.
The arrested people are said to have appeared outside the justice building in Sherbrooke hours after their arrest.
They could be charged, among other things, with the accusation of the production of cannabis, its possessions for sale purposes, the plot and the service of crimes.
These house searches had taken place as a result of a lengthy investigative activity, which took place for over a year.
"The information received from the public purse has allowed us to carry out these arrests," M. Ruel.
Around 70 police officers from the Estonia Regional Investigation Unit of Quebec Security Police, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphrémagog Police Department had taken part in this police operation.
Secret immigration could easily be tracked
The Conservatives' bill, which, according to the government, is intended to address the problem of ships loaded with clandestine immigrants, is expected to be stamped out after the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot endorse the proposal.
"I strongly oppose this charter."
"I hold on to your feet with a party that has put shackles on your feet," Michael Ignatieff, head of the Liberals, declared in front of the assembled MPs after the weekly caucus meeting expired.
The Liberals claimed that the bill, which allows each person identified by a seagoing vessel to be identified to be the transport of illegal immigrants, to be detained for up to a year, violated the Canadian Constitution of Law and Freedom as proposed.
Gilles Duceppe, head of the Bloc Québécois, also indicated that he would not be able to support the draft law, as he opposes the wrong target group.
"We are against it and it seems that all opposition parties are against it, so we will wait and see what the government is doing," M explained. Duceppe.
Criticism of Olivia Chow's immigration issue, NDP, has dismissed critics demanding that her party was not behaving steadfastly enough towards the secret immigrants.
"The neo-Democrats agree to take action against the blind passengers, and this is precisely what we are trying to enforce by brokering another draft law, the C-35," Chow said.
We are therefore not in favour of the Conservatives' bill because it seeks the blame on the refugees and holds children captive for at least a year," Chow explained.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney accused the opposition parties of playing with politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians strongly inform MPs that they are not tolerating this kind of secret immigration, these criminal events that affect Canada and that treat the country like a doormat."
"They expect Canada to take tough action," according to Minister Kenney's reaction.
"The government has not announced any vote of confidence in its draft law that could have led the country to elections that the government would have rejected.
However, a conservative has told the QMI agency that the government would convene a vote so that every opposing MP immediately declares himself to his constituents.
The new unit finds no unanimity
Despite the announcement of the possible establishment of a new, standing unit to fight corruption and collusion on the part of Jean Charest, numerous observers continue to call for the formation of a public committee of inquiry on this issue.
Robert Dutil, public security minister, claims that this idea is not yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investigation about this issue as early as last January.
The metropolis has had a standing unit against corruption since 1870.
Still, Wednesday's announcement has taken more than one by surprise.
It must be said that this measure is taking place at the meeting of the Quebec Police Service Standing Committee on 29. October last year, despite Robert Dutil's presence, was not discussed in the least.
Nor was it lacking that Stéphane Bergeron, critic and member of the Parti Québécois, qualified this announcement in terms of public safety as a "rabbit conjured out of the hat" as well as "rebuked solution at one end of the table."
Minister Dutil, for his part, had turned to those who fear that political power had too much influence on the questioning, future unity.
"They will see the result when we announce it," he said, satisfied.
“You are aware of this problem.”
According to Réjean Parent, the president of CSQ, nothing can replace the conduct of a public survey.
"The more M. Charest insists on trying to prevent the formation of this committee of inquiry, the more people like you and I think he has something to hide," he explained.
"The only means to form a committee of inquiry is the resignation of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisvert, a lecturer in ethics and policy systems at the ENA (staatl. University for the training of high-ranking administrative officers).
In order to get out of this impasse, he proposes to Quebec to give financial audit control a special mandate so that it can conduct appropriate investigations on corruption and secret collusion.
"One should be able to extend the mandate of audit control," he decided.
He also believes that Quebec could give the same power to audit control as commissioners, which would also allow it to require people to testify.
The formation of a standing entity is not the only project in the drawers of the Charest government.
Quebec will also require Ottawa to amend the criminal law in order to be better prepared for this type of crime.
This demand comes from the Chief Prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law in this type of prosecution is not clear.
Vic Toews, Minister of State for Public Security, confirmed that his colleague from the judiciary, Rob Nicholson, is currently dealing with certain amendments concerning this dossier.
During Operation Printemps 2001, which affected the groups of motorcycle police officers, 131 people had been arrested, although the criminal law had not been amended.
Ottawa has enforced the law against gangsterism.
Rivers under strict surveillance
Several rivers continue to remain under close guard due to the high rainfall that has spilled out in some regions of the province since Tuesday.
In Shawinigan, in the Mauricie administrative region, a landslide occurred on Wednesday afternoon.
Two houses were evacuated preventively.
In the evening, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in the Lanaudiere administrative region.
A street has collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday evening, heavy rains of 40 to 70 milliliters of rainfall have spilled over several regions.
Between 20 and 40 more millimeters of rainfall were expected here according to the regions by Thursday evening.
The areas north of the river as well as the valley of the Outaouais region were the most affected.
A total of up to 100 millimeters of rain showers had fallen here.
Since the snow melt, which has already accumulated in certain sub-areas, is to be added to these precipitations, the crossing of several watercourses is feared.
On Wednesday evening, the Quebec Security Service issued warnings about the flood alarm regarding the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in the Lanaudiere region.
The rivers in the north, in Saint-Jérôme, in the Laurentine mountains and the Chêne in Lotbinière, become the object of flood surveillance and remain under observation.
In the Lanaudière region, heavy rainfall has led to the crossing of some lakes in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and also in Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, an evasive bridge was torn away due to the heavy rains.
Ten residences had to be evacuated as a preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the crossing of certain lakes has caused the closure of several roads, especially in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The security service remains on alert and monitors the situation closely, according to Security Councillor Annik Bouchard.
The Quebec State Flood Center, for its part, issued warnings on Wednesday of the sharp rise in several rivers, in particular of Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont partly rebuked
Quebec Radio presenter Stéphane Dupont has suffered a partial setback before the Canadian Supervisory Board for Broadcasting Standards (CCNR) because of his controversial comments on social welfare and Haitians, as well as because of his outlandish speech on radio.
The CCNR has the opinion, M. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their own opinion, but certain statements contained "inaccurate information about social care and unjustifiably negative representations of the Haitians, as well as such a rude manner of speech, which is not appropriate for broadcasts broadcast during the day."
The Supervisory Board had also concluded that a discussion of suicide involving the distribution of the names of two people who committed suicide violates the Code of Broadcasting.
The CCNR had received several complaints regarding the comments made during the 2008 and 2010 broadcasts.
The first injunction was lodged as a result of a complaint by the Front commun des personnes assistées sociales du Québec.
The activist organization had complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were inaccurate.
The moderators should rather give solid than misleading information.
With regard to the topic of suicide, moderator Stéphane Dupont had the opinion that suicide was an expression of cowardice.
The majority of the Supervisory Board members had concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to life crises.
"The majority of the Supervisory Board takes into account that the consequences of the broadcast "Dupont le midi" in question would have addressed a sensitive topic in a family-friendly and suitable manner."
Therefore, he was not tainted with any blame for his person.
The last point of contention was the statements that had referred to the earthquake in Haiti.
Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had delivered a media-effective dispute in this regard, which had provoked a lot of reactions.
The CHOI moderator had declared that he had not donated in favor of Haiti aid, since one did not know with certainty whether the needy would really receive the monetary donations.
The Supervisory Board is of the opinion that these comments were not of an abusive nature, but that their cumulative effect presented an unjustifiably negative presentation of the Haitians.
"I have already served my three-day suspension sentence in this matter."
"My file has been virgin for a year and a half," the presenter explained.
In all resolutions, the Supervisory Board denounces the dissemination of an unravaged mode of expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM had acted broadcaster announcer "beyond its obligations."
The consequences for the broadcaster, which, among other things, had to communicate its decisions once during the prime time within a period of three days, are minor.
A King of Kung-Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, of Montreal Algerian origin, has taken a very special course.
The athlete, who excels in "Sanda" (full contact Kung-Fu), in kickboxing as well as in Thai boxing, is now ascending to the tatami and into the boxing rings of the world in the search for new challenges.
"I started martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing in Algeria 12 years ago," explained Zemmal, who has been based in the metropolis since 2008 to develop among the professionals.
I personally seek the fight everywhere, because for those who do not like the ground combat as the mixed martial arts present it, competitions in North America are rare.
Recently, the one working of his sign as a security guard as well as employed by the company UPS had given his rivals bad news, in which he at the between the 23rd and 30. October in Edinburgh, Scotland, World Championship of Amateurs won two gold medals from the World Karate as well as the Kickboxing Association (WKA).
"I won the winning in the categories of full-contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explained.
"Currently, I'm preparing for the World Cup at the San Shou in China."
"It had been invited to those fighters from each category who had placed themselves in the top four at the last World Cup."
"I won bronze in Toronto in 2009."
“I finished eighth in Vietnam in 2005.”
"In 2007, I finished the tournament in fifth place in China, while I finished third in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"It's worth noting that I've made progress in every competition."
"With this rhythm, I'll be first this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are disciplines originating from China, where punches and kicks are permissible as well as floor throws.
The duels usually play out on a platform, less often in a boxing ring.
The most renowned boxing fighter who has emerged from this type of martial arts is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, who is well known in the world of martial arts.
Should Nacer Zemmal withhold only one event in his career, he would certainly call his presence at the "King of Sanda" super-tournament, the kung-fu's Super Bowl.
"This competition is the highest-ranking and most respected in China," the sympathetic pound guy explained.
"It's a bit like the equivalent of the Lumpinee stadium (the biggest stadium in Thailand)."
"That was a super experience."
Zemmal had won his first fight in the semi-finals of his category (80kg) before losing in the final.
"The one who defeated me was a real professional," he said.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals will meet in the final of their category."
"Then the winners of each category stand up to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tender
Hydro-Québec has mutually agreed to grant project planning companies 450 million dollars in contracts for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydropower project.
In the middle of this avalanche of more than 100 contracts stands a consortium consisting of the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has received the most important share, namely that of the project management, to a sum of 295 million dollars without tender.
This consortium, called "Énergie gérance," was formed in 2004 as a side effect of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector its responsibility to hand over this important hydroelectric project in the amount of a sum of 5 billion dollars.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium "Énergie gérance" got the lucrative treaty without a public tender.
For the Parti Québécois, resorting to corporate consortia poses a serious ethical problem that encourages the risk of competition displacing and increasing prices.
"This is a new way of a mapped-out game and invalidating the competition."
"This means that instead of played games instead of secretly, you are now in open form," Sylvain Simard, a member of the PQ, said at the press conference yesterday.
By early morning, Simard had raised the question before the National Assembly, because it seems difficult for him to understand how the public's interest can be served in this way.
Resource Minister Nathalie Normandeau had responded by the afternoon, denying vehemently that this contract would have been a mapped-out game.
"I remain true to my line," she slammed, confirming that the PQ had proceeded "dishonestly" and that it "lacked hardship."
She said it was "the least" the PQ apologized.
The consortium model is a common practice worldwide.
It is usually such a temporary alliance that allows two or more companies to pool their expertise in terms of a bid for a tender for a complex project.
The project "Eastmain" has a high level of complexity regarding its work level.
The construction process is underway and is due to be set up by 2012.
Nevertheless, the contract was awarded without any competition having taken place; negotiations had already taken place.
In addition, the consortium’s model in Quebec is by no means an exception, even for relatively simple projects.
As the newspaper "Le Devoir" noted last week, the consortium's model used in the civil engineering and consulting field is the subject of government investigations.
A brief flyover of the Quebec business register allows more than 200 to be named consortia, some of which appear to be of constant duration.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau cooperates in partnership with the majority of its core competitors, which include CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin or Roche and Tecsult.
Any linkage, and there are several dozen of them, leads back to one and the same legal person, namely Dessau.
As for the consortium "Énergie gérance," Minister Normandeau has stressed that "the territory of Baie James is subject to a special labour dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has been paying special account to this fact since the 1970s."
Réal Laporte, the great employer of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has issued a statement that has caused the nose over the fact that the contract for project management has been approved after agreement.
"If you make a tender and there are few applicants, your prizes will skyrocket."
"So you have two options: either you take the people who are on this mart and tell you: they will negotiate a satisfactory agreement at a good price."
"The idea, however, is that it is not the price that is decisive, but the expertise of the persons," Laporte affirmed.
This contract approved by the consortium "Énergie gérance" is part of a long list of contracts for more than 50,000 dollars received from the Parti Québécois.
The contracts were approved either by the Hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" counted more than 100 engineering and consultant contracts, which were approved by companies or their branches, including in particular resource laboratories, between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had reached 22 contracts, Génivar had received 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without including their participation in "Énergie gérance".
All these contracts have been negotiated.
They total 449 $783 344, including the contract with "Énergie gérance" for $295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard had announced that the four companies that form the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) of the "Parti libéral du Québec" were well known.
Minister Normandeau had hinted that the PQ was equally connected with the companies that "financed" it before clarifying that it was rather their executives.
Barometer of responsible consumption - The "green" label is not trust-inspiring
Greener, but unequivocally skeptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in the key players in sustainable growth, but also not with the brands labeled or the eco-labelling that are intended to govern his choice.
Too bad, although it bathes in a media-effective universe, where information in favor of a more responsible consumption is teeming: the barometer of responsible consumption has a lack of credible information to lament, an inadequacy that identifies itself as the brake of its commitment, as the first reading, which was held yesterday, showed.
Although they pushed ahead with the consumption of the so-called socially acceptable products in 2010, Quebecers still seem to pay little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of the Quebec population admits that it is in fact no more credible to the environmental commitment of the companies than to the green advertising of the company, the measuring instrument, which is sophisticated by the responsible consumer center of the University of Sherbrooke, reveals.
Another finding: half of consumers doubt the trustworthiness of the official certificates attached to the supposedly fair products, but also to the credibility of the products and brands, which declare themselves to be environmentally conscious, according to the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the discourse of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of the Quebec population.
However, the information on responsible consumption seems important to stimulate this consumer segment, which is currently animated by almost one third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, emptiness and doubtful nature of the information dampened the zeal of 46% of consumers.
This is the second brake identified by the barometer after the higher price of the products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers are suspicious of the stated performance of the green products and services that they are trying to put to their hands.
According to another communication, more than half of consumers had already changed their habits in 2010 and predominantly changed the brand of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to the barometer, they had also preferred 61% purchases from merchants in their neighborhood and favored the purchase of food grown in their region.
Greener and more responsible - the index of environmentally conscious consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 this year - Quebec's Homo consumus loves to present itself as the king of recycling, trying to reduce its traces left in the environment by taking care of animal welfare.
But the social and ecological consciousness still seems to stop at his car, according to the barometer: just 28% of Quebecers have indicated that they used public transport in 2010 or preferred the ride-sharing center to demonstrate their ecological interest.
The walking and cycling were also advocated by 39.1% of the participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which feeds the stereotypes.
Government bond for acquisition of eXcentris
The Quebec government, which was asked by Société Angus and the company Parallèle to participate financially in the takeover of the eXcentris cinema complex, agrees to cooperate, but only in the form of a competitive bond.
The developer company Angus and the company Parallèle, who had hoped for a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Culture to take over the Daniel Langlois cinema complex eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent, in order to hand it back to its actual cinematic function, apparently do not receive what they have demanded.
The government has accepted to engage in this matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Quebec government is rather offering a bond in less than the initially hoped-for amount, which could launch a viable solution on beneficial terms, at least in the opinion of the sources removable from the state rumour mill.
A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million had already been rejected by Quebec last spring, the request for a request has been revised downwards in total since then.
A proposal, together with an action plan, has already been sent by the President of the "Société de développement des entreprises culturelles" (SODEC), François Macerola, to Minister St-Pierre, who is leading the eXcentris file.
Several days ago, he sent her one last report.
However, the cabinet's counter-proposal was forwarded to the SODEC on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angus now have until 31. December time to respond to this.
In any case, the premise of state donation seems to have really been pushed to the side.
Do we recall that the Quebec ownership association of cinemas and cinema complexes had opposed a direct state investment to support the acquisition of eXcentris by making the argument that the Minister of Culture had no financial assistance to provide for real estate projects there, which he did not also send to other cinema halls.
However, several other market participants in the segment sued in contrast to substantial, economic assistance.
Cinema director Daniel Langlois had presented the author cinema in the premises of his cinema complex for over ten years under great difficulty, which could justify the exceptional position on the part of the state treasury.
The lack of cinemas showing independent films is more than obvious in Montreal, and eXcentris knew how to keep his clientele at bay.
The Société Angus and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the helm, in turn head for a privately financed campaign, from which they hope to raise a sum of $700 000 to boost the acquisition.
Since the spring of 2009, only a single screen has continued to show films in eXcentris, namely Le Parallèle.
The aim of the future acquirers is to reopen the three cinema halls on 27 February next year with the screening of the very successful film by Xavier Beauvoi's "Des hommes et des dieux".
Christian Yaccarini, however, did not recall the newspaper "Le Devoir" and one ignores what he and his group think of the downwardly corrected proposals that have been made to them.
Mystery of complex-shattered Canada revealed
The new, American diplomatic lines, which were circulated by WikiLeaks, reveal the secret of what the United Nations considers to be among the Canadians’ inferiority complex to the Americans, but they expose the latter sense of superiority to Canada with the same blow.
Consequently, the American diplomats are amazed that the Canadian voter does not have Canadian-American relations in mind on the ballot, and they believe that President Obama’s visit would have helped the conservative government to enforce its 2009 budget!
The four new messages between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington, which were publicly circulated yesterday, provide even more piquant details than the mere substantial content to nibble on.
One of the 22. September 2008 dating connection, i.e. in the period in which the federal election campaign was in full swing, reports on the point from which the United Nations no longer participates in the deployments discussed by its political chiefs.
To the great astonishment of David Wilkins, the American ambassador appointed in Ottawa.
Mr Wilkins offers various explanations of this situation.
“A vastly inherent invertability complex may potentially cause Canadian, political leaders to talk about internal issues of everyday life than to blame the United States on black Peter in this election (as in the 1988 campaign on free trade),” he said.
The United Nations, he concludes, is thus "the proverbial Goliath of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak of him."
The ambassador understands this "deafening silence" all the less, as the two countries have intense political and economic relations.
"Logically," he assesses, "it should be the ability of a candidate, a party and even more of a party leader to lead such an essential relationship that the voter has as a key factor in the sense of the ballot."
The other expression of this feeling of importance reads in the one on 22. Anniversary 2009 by Terry Breese, an Ottawa business executive, sent a message to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
"Their journey will help ensure the continued existence of the government in the confidence vote on the federal budget in early February, in which Canada will announce its first deficit after more than a decade, which has emerged due to a revival program in the amount of 30 to 40 billion dollars," Breese describes.
Nowhere had he mentioned that the government had to adjourn the parliamentary session before Christmas to prevent parliament from being overthrown by the coalition and the continued existence of the opposition parties would affect the quality of the proposed revival programme.
Another communication, dated January 2008 and written by the Ambassador of Wilkin, Washington notifies of the increasingly negative image that the dramatic series broadcast via CBC are spreading from the United States.
The ambassador is troubled by broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one can observe unsubtle innuendo of Maher Arar, the "no-fly-list" or even derivations for the purpose of interrogations conducted by the CIA's muscle protégé.
Another communication goes on to report in detail on how Hillary Clinten asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner at her first bilateral meeting whether Europe was ready to accept certain prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr Kouchner is said to have answered yes to the question, but on the basis of an individual "case on case" decision.
Àm end of the meeting, as described, "he handed the Secretary of State a paper in terms of Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary of State has pledged to review the file."
Finally, let’s note that the spirits are heating up with regard to the website WikiLeaks.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper very close adviser, had stated via CBC that those responsible for this massive leak should be "killed."
He had referred to Mike Huckabee from the United States here.
Global plan to renew lighting
The UN proposed a plan in Cancun yesterday to renew the lighting of households, trade and industry in 100 countries with a view to achieving a reduction in greenhouse gas (CFCs) equivalent to nearly one-third of the additional reduction that needs to be realized to stabilize the Earth's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in the steps of the concrete major projects that the UN hopes to implement in Cancun in order to compensate for the absence of mandatory reduction commitments of the industrialized countries.
According to the plan put forward yesterday, the main problem would be avoided in the form of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of the CFC released to the earth due to the lighting if the white-glowing bulbs, which so far still represent a monopoly of 50 to 70% on the market, would be replaced by fluorescent or better yet, by light-emitting diodes (LEDs).
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the exhaust gases of the worldwide fleet.
In Copenhagen last year, the major exhaust emissions, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, had committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global CFC emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, one would still have to deduct 5 Gt from this balance to stabilize the climate increase of 2 degrees Celsius from today until 2020 in order to prevent it from getting out of control.
In the white-glowing bulbs, 95% of the energy escapes in the form of heat, and the remaining 5% produce the light.
With the compact phosphors, the energy consumption is reduced by 75%, with the new LED light bulbs this energy requirement is reduced again by two times.
The compact phosphor bulbs average between 6000 and 10,000 hours.
The new LED light bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week - this company, incidentally, has taken part in the UN study - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a white-hot bulb, which conveys a hint of the savings possibilities of the exchange plan, which is to be applied in 100 countries.
In addition to the fact that these completely new light bulbs give off very little heat, they can also work with a control resistor.
And they do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have shown that compact phosphor bulbs have reserves, since they contain mercury and that they must therefore be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in the developing countries, unless the producers provide an acceptance point.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet, according to the report, is not the compact phosphor bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants that emit substantially more mercury to generate the electricity wasted by the white-glowing bulbs.
In the United States alone, these coal-fired power plants emit 25,000 tonnes of mercury annually.
The report details the profits that each country would generate thanks to this international programme.
Indonesia, for example, would save one billion dollars annually on the purchase of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3.5 coal-fired power plants, the construction of which would cost Indonesia 2.5 billion.
Ivory Coast excitedly awaits announcement of election results
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election immediately after its deadline.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need of the independent Electoral Commission to preserve its work and to announce the preliminary results without further delay," a press spokesman for the UN chief stressed.
"He asks all Ivory Coast parties and institutions to demonstrate their accountability and to abstain from any initiative until the preliminary results are announced."
Despite the pressure exerted by certain foreign governments, the Electoral Commission had let the deadline, which was set at midnight on Wednesday, three days after the election on Sunday, without the release of the results.
About forty minutes before the deadline, the President of the CEI had confirmed on television that the Commission would "continue with the work" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, many calls from all over the world have become loud that the CEI will finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round of the election under the outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponents Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo camp anticipates the cancellation of "fraudulent" votes in the north by the Constitutional Council, which was scored by the ex-rebel camp of the Forces nouvelles (FN) during the coup failed in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N'Guessan, head of the Ivory Coast presidential campaign, had confirmed that the FN's practiced maneuvers to intimidate voters in the north of the country had deterred the president's supporters from going to the polls.
The entire election could be annulled if the lawsuits filed by Gbagbo are considered by the Constitutional Council.
However, the Gbagbo counterparties are now more of the view that the country's highest court is not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a politically closely associated with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, man of the North who denies any connection to the ex-rebels, has judged the delay in announcing the election results to be "unacceptable" and asked Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies affirm that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he has lost; and to file a complaint before the Constitutional Court after the Electoral Commission is prevented from publishing the results is illegal.
Sunday's second round of presidential elections were held for the crowning of the unification and reconciliation process of a country that had been divided into two for years.
The United Nations on Wednesday warned Ivory Coast politicians that it could be held responsible for it in the event of possible riots.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first round of voting on 31. October with 38% of the vote against the 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who enjoyed the public support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round), as the top candidate behind him.
Unemployment rate in France remained stable in third quarter
The unemployment rate in France is in the interest of the International Labour Office (IAA) in the metropolis at a stable 9.3% (with the inclusion of the overseas departments at 9.7%), according to the preliminary, seasonally adjusted data published on Thursday by the Federal Statistical Office in the Insee.
The unemployment figure in the metropolis is establishing 2.631 million.
The second quarter data amounted to 9.3% of the working population in the metropolis and 9.7%, including overseas departments.
Over the year, the unemployment rate saw an increase of 0.1 percentage points.
In more detail, 3.4 million people in employment in the French metropolis were not employed in the third quarter, but wished to find a job, whether they were operational every two weeks or not or not.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to deteriorate with an increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2% in the metropolis (+ 0.9 percentage points within three months, +0.5 percentage points over the year) and 25% with the involvement of overseas regions.
In the third quarter, 637,000 of young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed, according to the IAA.
Senior citizens, for their part, have seen a slight increase in the unemployment rate of 6.4% in the metropolis (+0.2 percentage points over three months and over the year), i.e. 482 000 of the over 50-year-olds, 6.6% including overseas departments.
Only the 25-49 year olds had benefited from the stability of unemployment in the third quarter; 8.3% in the metropolis (-0.1 percentage point over three months, +0.1 percentage points over a year) and 8.8% in France overall.
After a dispute over his calculation procedures, the Federal Statistical Office insee has not published the monthly unemployment figures since 2006.
Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, on the other hand, continues in this method and announced on Tuesday a rate of 9.8% in France for October (including the overseas departments) compared to 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guérini charged and arrested
Alexandre Guérini, 53, head of a disposal company and brother of the President of the General Council of the Bouches-du-Rhône Region (PS), was investigated and he was sent to the prison in Luynes near Aix-en-Provence in the course of an investigation into the public and suspected markets.
Alexandre Guérini was charged with embezzlement of company assets, embezzlement of general goods, concealment, complicity in corruption, illicit bribery and possession of weapons, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is ready to fight and intends to comment on all the questions that the prosecution will ask him instead of spreading fantasies."
"It is easy to insinuate a number of criminal charges, another matter is to prove them," his lawyer Florence Rault told AFP (Agence France Press) before his client's hearing.
Mr Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti socialiste) in the department, had attached great importance to giving the judge a memoradum to his justification before his hearing through his lawyers.
A relative of Guérinis, Philippe Rapezzi, was also indicted and jailed on Wednesday night.
According to lawyer Lucien Simon, her client had never done anything other than keep his landfill, which he had to run, running.
He would never have been aware of the business competence area or the target of the associated funds, according to Simon.
In this affair, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the civil service of the Aubagne metropolitan area, was also indicted on Wednesday for embezzlement and complicity, but then released under the condition of staying away from the protagonists of these legal acts under judicial supervision.
"My client was able to provide explanations of the facts he was accused of."
"The lead prosecutor has taken into account not to deprive him of his freedom, said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other people had been charged and released from custody on the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, including two of them under legal supervision, according to deputy chief prosecutor Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy managing director of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) disposal company, is being prosecuted on the basis of "unauthorised influence and passive bribery."
Two civil servants from the Aubagne metropolitan area, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Eviction and embezzlement of common goods by a public service commissioner," the other for "complicity in the event of embezzlement of public funds."
The partner of Alexandre Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was also accused of "exaggeration and embezzlement of social assets".
Among the people who were juxtaposed with Guérini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, recently jailed for a similar affair of fraudulent machination from public hands that had affected Corsica.
The investigators suspect his company of having helped to launder money from "high" criminal circles.
The investigation against X for alleged fraud in the award of public contracts, in particular in the disposal branch, will be conducted in the files of several open investigative proceedings in April 2009 as a result of anonymous letters.
It is clear from nearby sources of investigation that the investigation focuses in particular on the conditions of the surcharge and the operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which also draws waste from the Aubagne area, as well as from certain cities of the Marseille urban basin (MPM).
Affaire Clotilde Reiss: the Elysee Palace is exaggerating its mediating function for Syria
Within more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher held in Iran for "espionage," kept the French public in breath, put diplomacy on high alert and accentuated the deterioration in relations between Paris and Tehran.
All this under the attentive gaze of the diplomats of the United States.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and reviewed by the newspaper "Le Monde" reveal some background of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysée had explained to the Americans his strategy, which went so far as to give this advice on how to deal with their own crisis of "hostage-taking" in Iran (a small group of hikers).
They show how the French leaders tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman did not result in the release of Majid Kakavand, a Iranian who was held captive in France and wanted by the American judiciary on the basis of trade in material in favor of the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they put the way in which the French Bureau tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making it credible the idea that Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
In truth, he had done nothing in that regard.
One on the 12. August 2009 Diplomatic Telegram edited in Paris is titled "Iran: French Commentaries on the Way of Dealing with Hostage-Taking."
François Richier, Elysée consultant on strategy issues, talked with American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone, accompanied by Patrice Paoli, director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East.
They explained the French method to her.
They advised the Americans to do everything they could to repatriate their own nationals who would be held violently in Iran.
"Makes noise," they said, "articulates loudly and clearly and without ceasing" the words "basic human rights," "innocence," "immediate release" in the media.
This is necessary to embarrass the Iranian regime, which pays very sensitive attention to its image.
“Do this all the more, especially since the Iranians ask you not to do so.”
Because "silence does not solve anything", over the discussion attempts in an inconspicuous way, the Iranians are "masters in evasive maneuvers".
Mr Richier adds that the arrest of foreigners was a "common, Iranian tactic": "hostage-taking for the purpose of political blackmail."
He announces the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (the one on 16. August was to come about on the day she flees to the French embassy) "demands the payment of a large sum of money to the Iranians" (230,000 euros bail).
And he lets it be announced that the Elysée anticipates further hostage-taking, a phenomenon that "will intensify."
The Iranians could "in the near future arrest another of the approximately 1,800 French citizens who live in Iran," he said.
28. August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss was released from prison twelve days ago, but continues to be held in Iran.
One piece of information has been circulated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition the United States is demanding due to illegal trade in sensitive electronic materials to Iran, has been released from custody after a judge in Paris decided.
The American Embassy, like numerous other observers, is asking questions about this disturbing coincidence.
For Washington, which is pursuing the illegal Iranian networks of acquiring the material earmarked for the nuclear program, the release of Majid Khakavand represents bad news.
Has France accepted a cow trade?
The liberation of the Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman?
On the occasion of a new discussion with Kathleen Allegrone on the 4. September assures François Richier that this is not the case.
The Elysée, he says, was not only "completely surprised by the judge's order," but had also tried to rebel against it.
"There has been a lively exchange between the French Bureau and the French Minister of Justice" (currently Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the judicial decision," he explains.
Mr Richier would also like to point out that Majid Kakavand continues to be under "strict" supervision of the French intelligence service.
The Elysée consultant dials a telephone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat, the Iranian "is currently in the buildings in Paris led by the Iranian Embassy".
While in the custody of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare its efforts to make, by means of pronouncements and media-organized "escape attempts," to make Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad play an "important" and "influential mediating role."
The Americans do not observe this activity without irony and state that the manipulation is bearing fruit, as several press articles reflect the official French version.
One of the 25. August 2009 dating telegram conjures up "the media flash of the French authorities."
What is so much "thank you" to Mr. Assad, the Paris Embassy wonders.
"Despite their declarations of praise, the French authorities secretly admit that they have only a vague idea of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then deals with the reasons that led the Elysée to fall into this fiction.
The intense communication efforts "aim to confirm Sarkozy's policy of opening up to Syria," he analyzes.
A 2008 policy launched, which at the time was "perceived by numerous critics' voices in France as well as abroad as premature and undeserved."
"Exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris tries to "bring Syria to the attention of what commendation you can make by playing a constructive role in the region."
The aim is also to "sow discord between Syria and Iran."
The American Embassy knows this from a good source.
On the 11. August had entrusted François Richier to her: "Of course we do not know whether the Syrians have done anything."
"But we thanked them in spite of everything."
"This should at least cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns on 16. May 2010 back to France.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her at the Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in favor of the release of our countryman."
No online games for young Koreans after midnight
The South Korean government will pass a law called "the Cinderella," which will prohibit young people from playing online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials indicated.
A draft law to urge online game operators to deny young people under the age of 16 access to these games after midnight will be submitted to parliament in December, representatives of culture and family ministries described.
"A lot of kids play these games all night long and then have difficulty learning at school and also with living a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," explained Jo Rin, the ministerial commissioner of the French press agency Agence France Presse, who is entrusted with this draft law.
The online games will be open again from 6 a.m.
The manufacturer companies would have one year to prepare for the application of the law, he specified.
The government is also envisaged asking manufacturers to reduce the time limit granted daily for access to these games to those young people whose parents are asking for it, the person in charge added.
He will also provide free programs to those who wish to have free programs that make it possible to limit the time spent on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "networked" countries, and the newspapers regularly report on various events associated with intensive Internet use.
The country is also an undisputed champion in worldwide online game competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals in the World Cyber Games, up from 58 other nations.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host country
In bright excitement due to suspicions of corruption, FIFA's executive committee on Thursday appoints the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a highly political choice in which the wrangling for influence as well as lobbying threatens to push the technical criteria into the background.
One thing is certain, however: the 2018 edition of FIFA's supreme discipline will take place in Europe, its traditional stronghold (the 4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain Portugal, Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will then be a little more exotic; the International Football Association hopes to win over new territories (Qatar, Australia) after its premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue pursuing its branch in the United States or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities belonging to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch Prime Minister, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) sets out the measure of the economic and political commitment of a World Cup.
The machinations behind the scenes are therefore threatening to stop until the last minute.
It is difficult otherwise to establish a hierarchy of candidates.
According to FIFA's evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts offer better arguments than those of their competitors.
But these considerations will not be so important for the 22 members of the executive committee at the hour of the election.
The Sunday Times, which was at the beginning of the revelations with the introduction of the suspension of two members of the Executif Committee (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could just as well have ruined the chances for their own country, the cradle of football, which was only allowed to host the World Cup once, namely 1966.
The BBC had again given the breeding ground to on Monday by airing a documentary report that is firing on three influential members of the committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Reason enough to upset FIFA and embarrass the English leaders who had been lobbying intensively with David Cameron in those last few weeks.
The head of government hopes for a new edition of the successful move by his predecessor Tony Blair, who had achieved the organisation of the 2012 Olympic Games for London in 2005.
Would this intense effort suffice to enhance England's image before the committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the duo Spain-Portugal do not lack trump cards with their already finished stadiums, their expertise (World Cup 82 in Spain, Olympic Games 92 in Barcelona, European Championship 2004 in Portugal) and his football culture.
Yet the economic and financial downsides of the two countries could dampen their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English, as well as the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal, increase the chances of Russia, which despite its gaps in the dossier (stadiums, hotels, transport) has become a weighty outsider.
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided to denounce the unwonderful hints of the English press's accusations of "an unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" on the part of the committee members.
"You throw dirt at them, you try to compromise them," Putin said.
For 2022, the United States, strengthened by the experience of 1994, seems to be the logical favorites.
First economic world power, seat of the FIFA main sponsors, the country seems to have a long list of advantages over Japan and South Korea, which have separately set up a very nice project.
Yet these new candidacies seem premature for two countries that co-organized the competitions in 2002.
Another threat: FIFA's highly anticipated approval of the 2026 World Cup for China, which makes the Asian chances of 2022 lapse.
With Australia and Qatar, which had pulled out all the stops with the expectation of futuristic stadiums, FIFA is pursuing its expansion towards new areas, but these two countries represent a greater risk, because certainty.
Australia, like Japan and South Korea, could suffer from the weakness of television rights (due to the time difference) acquired by European countries, the sensitive nerve of FIFA.
Second mandate: the obviousness
De Gaulle had really trimmed.
Mitterand had made it possible to believe that he was stumping.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac showed not the slightest hesitation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less than this.
One mandate in the Elysee summons the next.
The current head of state will be ergo candidate in 2012.
But the obviousness does not look good on the side of the mystery attached to the presidential function.
So you have to pretend that the doubt exists from now on.
One, as in the other sense.
In 2006, Jacques Chirac’s supporters pretended that a third mandate was not excluded without believing it.
On the 15. In November, Nicolas Sarkozy, in a serious tone, assured his decision to make his decision "sometime in the autumn of 2011."
The fact that he would hint at the perspective of "two mandates" on Tuesday evening in the Elysée in front of the UMP parliamentarians had spread a little feverishness.
Was that the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from it.
The president merely reminded that the 2008 constitutional amendment limited the number of five-year terms to just two.
He made a statement, not an announcement.
It's not the first time he's mentioned the presidential election on the occasion of such meetings in a humorous tone.
"You still have seven and a half years with me at worst, or at best," he explained to them in July 2009.
To a new in May 2010: "Don't think I'm thinking about the phase after."
His words from the day before yesterday make him no more a candidate than the previous day; but neither do he any less.
Should they provoke comments, then for a twofold reason.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy with the PS on one side.
But it is not the inclusion of the competition with Ségolène Royal, which is driving Nicolas Sarkozy to reveal herself.
On the contrary, it is his obvious candidacy in 2012 that many members of the PS admonish earlier than assumed to fight.
The bad polls on the other side.
For the first time, voters of the right would prefer a candidacy of François Fillon of that of Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to poll of the BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate, and there is no discussion about it whatsoever with the UMP," the prime minister's environment responded immediately and cautiously.
"If he were to be a defeat as possible, he would not be a candidate," Jean-Pierre Raffarin shares.
"He will always believe in winning," corrects Alain Juppé, who has come to terms with the obviousness.
Euro: the ECB is forced to maintain its purchases of government securities
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB last year should provide an opportunity to point out ways to get out of the crisis, or at least to announce the order of a large number of unconventional monetary policy measures to be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of European public debt obliges, the central bank in Frankfurt can undoubtedly not afford to forfeit even today's, more than tense situation on the European bond markets, so as not to provoke their aggravation.
The political costs would be far too high.
Yesterday, at a press conference, French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role taken by the ECB in favour of resolving Europe’s national budget debt.
She did not dare to say whether she thought the central bank could do more, for example by boosting its program of purchases of government bonds.
"I reserve my considerations for my European trading partners (...) ".
Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, had not shown himself very edincated in relation to his plans the previous day in Brussels on the occasion of his hearing by the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament, but rather was content to point out that the programme of purchases of government securities on the secondary market would "continue" and that we will "see at the meeting on Thursday how the decisions turn out to be."
The only certainty: the ECB will keep its key interest rate unchanged at 1%, the historically lowest level since May 2009.
In practice, the Treasury's bond purchases were doubled by the ECB last week to about 1.35 billion euros.
And according to indiscretions of some traders, she is said to have made new purchases of Irish and Portuguese government securities yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Eurosystem have made purchases of 67 billion euros since May 2010.
Among the traders, the anticipation of a follow-up of the purchase price is not doubted (see page 29).
The economists no longer expect a remarkable change in course.
If the bond transactions of over three months have already disappeared from the ECB's arsenal, the latter will still face the unrestricted cash reserves in a generous way, over a period of one week to three months.
The economists are already looking today that this measure will continue to expand for a few more months.
"I cannot imagine that the ECB will change its programme in an essential way."
"Otherwise, it would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term," Michael Schubert, Commerzbank's economist, suspects.
"A progressive exit planned for the course of the first quarter of 2011 seems more likely to me," said Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In the area of its interventions in the market of public debt, "the ECB should maintain such a volume of purchase of bonds that enlivens the sluggish market," adds Norbert Bräms.
Considering the relevance of the exposed position of European banks in the markets of public debt in the eurozone, the central bank has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must, at any cost, take the place of the lack of investors in the market and act in this way to prevent the rash enthusiasm for the returns paid to the weakest countries," a key bondholder testified yesterday.
Because if interest rates start to high, the states would be even more prevented from reducing or even stabilizing their debt.
This is the price to protect the euro.
The Berlusconi government is taking cover in Italy
After a worrying start to the week for Italy, the situation eased a little yesterday with the decline in corner interest rates to 10 years.
A return to deceptive silence.
At the end of the meeting with the economy minister, the region's chairmen Giulio Tremonti had qualified the situation as "indecipherable" and heard him expect an "unpredictable" weekend, which the person concerned immediately denied.
On Tuesday, in any case, the scissors with the German interest rates would have reached its record of 210 basis points, and the prices of the contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy had risen to 263 points, which had provoked a certain headlessness in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi had pointed out to his Council of Ministers that Spain's discrepancy at German interest rates is 400 basis points.
However, his right-hand man, Gianni Letta, had spoken out as "severely concerned" by the "market turmoil" and a possible risk of contagion from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, the eurozone's third economy, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal," explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In plain language, this means that his problem is the absence of economic growth and the associated, swindling tax inputs that put the state at risk of no longer being able to meet its financing needs.
The latest Brussels forecasts were a cold shower for the government.
In the future, Italian growth of 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012 is expected... although the budget available for examination at the Senate expects 1.3% and 2% respectively.
Under these conditions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget deficit will still account for 4.3% of GDP next year (contrary to the 3.9% predicted by governments) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the turmoil over a new budget collective, which could be used after the holidays to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," says auditor Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy is receiving the support of international institutions.
"The foundations of Italy's economy are fine and its accounts are regulated, we have been repeating that for a long time," assures Arrigo Sadun, Italian trustee of the International Monetary Fund, which is entrusted with Italy at the IMF.
"At the moment there are no problems, neither in the short term nor in the long term, since from Italy, despite its high debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, A.d. R.) lower stabilization progress is required than from other countries," observes Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist at the OECD.
The question remains about political instability.
On 14. In December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of no confidence in the Chamber of Deputies, as a result of which the early elections could be organised at the end of March.
So there is a little favorable period for a decision on a serious crisis.
Europeans are considering the expansion of anti-crisis measures
Christine Lagarde had emphasized it yesterday at a press conference in Paris: "I think it was proved on Sunday afternoon and also in the evening: The Europeans clearly stick together, are ready and committed to defend their currency and their currency area".
Although perfectly relative - the deduction recorded yesterday in the interest rates of the European government bonds was water on the mills of the governments and the ECB.
However, there can be no mention of a start of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's had announced that it could reduce the debt notice of Portugal, probably the most effective target of the speculators today.
"As in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political perceptibility that is particularly based on the banking systems," according to the opinion of the economists of the Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially since "political time is fading much slower than that of the markets."
The European countries, which are well aware of both this gap and the danger that lies in it, are intensifying the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis measures.
The informal discussions between the most directly affected finance ministers and, in the broader sense, with their counterparts of the G20 are progressing well.
And this is also with regard to the meetings of Eurogroupe and Ecofin early next week.
The ECB is meeting today.
The plan includes the lot of unconventional measures to strengthen the backs of eurozone countries in the crosshairs of the markets (see below).
As far as the EU stability funds are concerned, its executive director Klaus Regling started its Asian tour in Singapour on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the developments regarding the crisis in Europe.
If the aim of his visit is not explicit fundraising, he certainly prepares the terrain for it.
The first securities expenditure on the part of the EU Stability Fund is scheduled for next month.
Yesterday, an official American representative had entrusted Reuters to the agency, the United States supported a possible increase in the funds mobilized by the additional, direct commitment of the IMF.
Portugal and Spain, the countries at the forefront, are in turn preparing to undertake structural reforms, particularly in the area of labour market organisation.
Reforms that are added to the austerity measures, but should show effects in the near future.
Lisbon and Madrid take a different path than Greece and Ireland have done.
Both one and the other are at any cost to avoid having to ask for international assistance before they have set up their own budget correctives and decided on inevitable structural reforms that will bring them back in the long run.
European investors, in turn, are talking about the options available to accelerate the normalisation process of the markets of government bonds.
Axel Weber, who will meet on 24. November in transit in Paris had become the first to produce the idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilised by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to reach into its own pocket again.
The economists of Barclays Capital, in the foreground of the market of European public debt, judge that an extension of around 100 billion euros would be sufficient, "preferably" in the form of a direct liquidity injection.
This remedy exists: the European mechanism of endowed financial stabilisation, which currently amounts to 60 billion euros.
An advisory board that has all the chances to be closely examined in the European capitals.
Especially when market conditions are tightening.
Snow and freezing ice: 24 departments in alarm level Orange
The snow episodes still entail traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary transport networks of Brittany and threaten to affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now in Orange alert due to the looming risk of snow and freezing ice.
The regions of Eure-et-Loir, Deux-Sèvres and Vienne have been added to the 20 departments already on alert level Orange; 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, the Dordogne and the Gironde, then later in the night.
According to Météo France, the intense snow showers affect the north of the Gironde as well as the Charentes, it snows easily on the et Ile-de-France.
In the affected departments, snow covers of 2 to 5 cm, sometimes also from 7 to 10 cm, and 1 to 3 cm, even up to 5 cm in the Paris region are expected.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Côtes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Basse-Normandie, Ile-de-France and Limousin are affected.
The snowfall is considerable enough to cause traffic obstructions and to affect certain economic activities, Météo France predicts.
In the Côtes d'Armor region, several regional roads are closed to heavy traffic of over 7.5 tonnes, including the traffic axes Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac.
The traffic situation of the secondary transport networks in Brittany is very difficult, according to the traffic police, who advise against using their own vehicle only in case of emergency, and the use of some TER coaches has been cancelled throughout the day.
In the Picardy, school traffic has been lifted for Thursday.
No specific restrictive measures were envisaged for heavy traffic on Wednesday evening.
The prefecture "urges motorists to exercise the utmost caution on the roads and to adjust their driving behaviour accordingly."
The Directorate-General for Civil Aviation (DGAC) urged airlines to cancel 25% of their flights departing from Paris's Roissy airport and 10% of flights departing from Orly on Thursday due to expected heavy snowfall.
The DGAB recommends air passengers to contact their airline.
Gatwick airports in south London, as well as Edinburgh, Scotland airport are closed until Thursday morning.
Métro Grand Paris: first financial sketches
Since the debate over the modernisation of the transport economy on the Ile-de-France is in full swing, it has been raining billions.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billion for the Metro Grand Paris, which is to be built by the Société du Grand Paris, is to be remembered.
In order to initiate the start of construction of the SGP, the state has declared a capital dopation of 4 billion euros.
In the theoretical scheme, this is the sum that would then allow the SGP to lend a portion of the financial sum to its double in the markets.
Today, the first projections finally occurred.
The Supplementary Budget of 2010, this morning reviewed by the Finance Commission of the National Assembly, contains the measures envisaged to raise the first part of these funds.
These are two measures: the creation of a special tax to access and increase the taxation of the offices on the Ile-de France.
The former, according to Article 15 of the draft law, goes "in favor of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
This is quantified: "The product of this tax amounts to 117 million euros per year".
The second is a reorganization of the already existing corporate taxation: "to modernize it, to increase the product resulting from it and to hand over this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would that bring in?
A mystery.
This sum is not numbered in the text.
The 4 billion is a long way off.
"It is stated that the tax resources will be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital dotation that is raised by the state and will gradually be provided to the Société du Grand Paris for the project," the statement said.
At the SGP you can't find this system offensive at all.
"Since the moment you record income (the two taxes, d. R.), you can cover the project planning for over three years and then only draw from the 4 billion," it is explained.
"This is noted in the budget and gradually deducted."
The SGP estimates that 2013 will be started to record the 4 billion for the 2014 budget.
This measure, the 4 billion promised, will be able to be sought for a long time, runs the risk of evoking a rather moving, parliamentary discussion.
The first public meeting will take place on 7. December instead.
Vindictive hackers and busy spies
The Affaire WikiLeaks has a double meaning.
On one side, it has turned out to be an obvious scandal, a scandal that is merely a scandal in the sense of hypocrisy, which governs relations between the states, the citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it announces profound changes at international level, and gives a taste of the future dominated by regression.
But let's proceed in turn.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by an intelligence service (of any nation) is composed solely of newspaper clippings.
The "extraordinary," American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi cast nothing more than what you've been reading for months anyway in any x-any journal (except those whose owner is Berlusconi), and the frighteningly cartooned profile of Gaddafi has been offering cabaret artists material for their sketches for a long time.
The rule, according to which the secret dossiers may only consist of already known news, is essential for the dynamics of the intelligence services, and not only in this century.
When you go to a library dedicated to esotheric publications, you will realize that every work (about the Grail, the Mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars, or the Rosicrucians) repeats exactly what has already been written in previous works.
This is not only because the author of occult texts does not want to publish research (not yet that he did not know where to find news about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism believe in nothing other than what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Likewise the secret files.
The informant is lazy, and lazy (or limited mind) is also the head of the intelligence service (otherwise he could be whatever, for example editor at Libération), who only considers true what he acknowledges.
The top secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome had sent to the State Department, were the same as those that Newsweek had published the week before.
So why was such a fuss made around the revelations of these dossiers?
On one side, these say what every educated person already knows, namely that the embassies - at least since the end of the Second World War and since the heads of government can also call each other or take a plane to meet for dinner - have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of a few small representational tasks, have turned into spy centers.
Any viewer of investigative films knows this very well, and it does not happen out of hypocrisy that you do so to ignore this.
Still, the fact of publicly repeating it violates the task of hypocrisy and serves to put American diplomacy in a bad light.
Second, the idea that an x-arbitrary hacker can tap into the most secret secrets of the world's most powerful country holds the significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
In addition, the scandal does not bring the victims, but rather the "snipers" into distress.
But let us focus on the profound nature of what happened.
Formerly, in Orwell's time, you could bundle all power like a Big Brother that controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell's prophecy could have turned out to be perfectly right since then, where you can control every movement thanks to the phone, every transaction made, the hotel visited, the chosen highway, and so on; the citizen would become the total victim of the eye of power.
But if one remembers what is going on today, that even the secret crypts of power can no longer escape the control of a hacker, the control session ceases to be one-sided and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - chosen as the citizen's avenger - can find out the secrets of power.
But how can a power that is no longer able to keep its own secrets?
True, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that any knowledge of the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is basically a secret of secret, since it reveals the public sphere; but in the style of WikiLeaks reveal that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, means to deprive them of any power.
WikiLeaks has not wronged either Sarkozy or Merkel, but Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this offense inflicted on such a tremendous power?
It is obvious that in the future, the states will no longer provide any reserved information online - this would amount to a notice attached to the street corner.
But it is equally obvious that with the current technologies, it is in vain to hope to be able to keep confidential reports secret over the phone.
Nothing is easier than finding out if and when a head of state has moved on a plane and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could private relationships, which are only for certain ears, be maintained in the future?
I know very well that my prediction sounds like science fiction and novelistic at the moment, but I see myself compelled to imagine the government agents, moving in secret on uncontrollable routes, hiding their messages nowhere else than in the mere memory, and hiding the little written information they have received, in the shoe heel.
The information would be stored in the only copy in locked drawers: basically, Watergate's espionage attempt had less success than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that technology is progressing like a cancer these days, namely backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (phone) wire.
The (analog) video cassettes had enabled the film researchers to scout out a film band by band by being able to coil from back to front and reveal all the secrets of the montage, while the (numerical) CDs nowadays allow nothing more than to jump from chapter to chapter, i.e. in macroportions.
High-speed trains run from Rome to Milan within three hours, while this requires three and a half hours by plane, including the changeover.
It is therefore not exceptional that politics and communication technology come back to the car and horse.
One last observation.
In earlier times, the press tried to understand what secrets were being forged between the messages.
At present, it is the messages that demand confidential information from the press.
Climate: how France is making its financial promises
One year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate compliance with the rapidly resolved financing promises (also called "fast start" or premature financing) realized by developing countries.
And already the rough French fine speeches are uncovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, developing countries have committed to providing 30 billion dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7.2 billion euros over three years, France 1.26 billion euros (i.e. 420 million a year).
On the occasion of the opening of COP16, the EU has pulled out all the stops to convince its partners of the fact of their commitment to fast-start financing: detailed action report of their Member States, press conference, large side events, distribution of brochures.
Operation transparency is remarkable and appreciated for its actual value: developing countries and civil society would like to see all developed countries do the same at the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it will have released 2.2 billion euros in 2010, putting it on the right track to pay respect for its commitment of 7.2 billion in 2012.
But when you look into the details, things are a little more complicated.
This money should be "new and additional," according to the Copenhagen Treaty, to ensure that an additional deployment was brought in without being to the detriment of official development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus on what means "new and additional."
While the EU Commission had proposed harmonisation, certain member states, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the guideline they consider best.
The EU Commission, for example, has chosen itself as a guideline for that of 2009: international financing is maintained, and adds 150 million in the context of the financing "fast-start" over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks, either in terms of year or conditions at official development aid level.
In return, France was of the opinion that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 were "new and additional."
In other words, there are no benchmarks in previous year's expenditure or at the global level of official development assistance.
Specifically, the total of French support for developing countries may remain stable (or decrease) - France is presupposing to comply with its commitment to the "new and additional" funding.
Another crucial element is the breakdown in donations and loans.
There is no rule on this yet, and everyone chooses their calculation mode.
Some, such as France, are €1 borrowed as equivalent with €1 donated.
Obviously, this is difficult to be justifiable: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain profitable investments (often projects linked to emission containment based on the most effective technology) can be justified, it is deceptive to present the euro that is being taken as the equivalent for a donated euro... In addition, only the cost of the loan for the investor country should be credited as a commitment (i.e. the equivalent of an interest rate).
But France has nothing in mind than the following consideration: it "respects" its commitment of 420 million euros by taking out 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and donating 8.5%) 36.1 million euros) - see also the EU document to convince itself of it.
France is the only country in the EU that uses loans to a large extent.
Germany is demanding 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (among other things) are making 100% of their commitments with donations.
In other words, if the vast majority of the European Union spends €1 on the fulfilment of their obligations, France will give just 10 cents and understand this to be a comparable stake.
Beautiful Hokuspokus!
All in all, France is operating with a double hoax in its fast-start financing: partly with a further development of the action over time and partly with the reality of financial commitment.
France manages to make it believe that it has spent 420 million "new and additional" millions in accordance with its promises, saving 36.1 million euros in the process.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (since it seems that it was Bercy who carried out the arbitrage) could have a doubly negative effect; once EU internally (why do the other member states continue with the donation, if it is enough to borrow?) and then in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely fooling...
The chapter of premature financing only a small question for a relatively short time compared to the totality of discussions about the climate.
But it could be the drop too much in the immense machinery of the UNFCCC.
Let's hope this is not going to be the case.
Be that as it may, it is essential to learn his lesson from this first year of premature funding.
First and foremost, France could announce a change in its type of accounting for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equalizing justice with the other countries of the European Union.
Above all, however, France could bring forward the discussions on the subject of long-term financing (a different, decisive and currently discussed topic): one does not escape the question of "computability" or the type of accounting of his loans.
France could change its position to be as progressive in the disputes as it is with other things.
So hope is based on the new environment minister, Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprising announcement about France's fast-launch and its vision of "computability" as well as the use of loans would inherently raise the international trust base necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - pesticides taken by children
A child of 10 years old occupies 81 different chemical substances over the day, according to a study published this Wednesday by the Générations Futures Association (former movement to protect the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which explains that its results "do not represent a statistically significant value given the low number of samples analysed, but represent the illustration character of the issue covered," had bought the food usually consumed within four, from a child about ten years old with meals, plus a snack in the supermarkets in Oise and Paris.
These typical meals - including the official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit parts, three dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day - were examined, as well as sweets from laboratories in search of chemical substances, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The plate balance is devastating: 81 chemical substances, including 42 classified as possibly or probably carcinogenic and five classified as safely carciogenic, as well as 37 substances with endocrinine disturbing factor, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Center.
"Even if, in the approximate totality of cases, the legal limits for each chemical, individually taken substance are not exceeded, this survey is very well removed from the fact that the reality in which the consumer is exposed to potentially carcinogenic substances or substances with endocrine interference factor is worrying," the association notes.
Already at breakfast, the butter and tea with milk alone already contain more than ten of the potentially carcinogenic residues and three safely proven to be carcinogenic, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormonal system.
The apple imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the study, has traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to the green beans from Kenya, included in the lunch, where the study has found traces of an insecticide strictly banned in the EU.
Furthermore, the chopping steak, the tuna from the can, even the baguette and the chewing gum of pesticides and other chemical substances were also peppered.
In the case of tap water, the analyses have brought to light the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon steak with 34 determined, chemical residues was the "richest," and even the plastic plate used to warm up the meal in the microwave was not unencumbered.
The final risk of this "pollutant cocktail" for the consumer "is likely to be undervalued," according to the study.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "given the urgency of the situation" to introduce a moratorium on the use of pesticides to stop the "increase in civilization diseases."
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified reference to the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables, which are consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
