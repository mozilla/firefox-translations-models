Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madhouse where young people are to meet today.
A tomb chapel, where now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small gardeners cultivate the former reason of farmers.
Munich's oldest official map brings exciting stories to light.
It sucks when maps are not current.
Everyone who has ever had to get upset, because the car navigation system showed a green meadow instead of a bypass.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but precisely for this reason very insightful.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of Munich's Mercury have been since 19. Have changed century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that you do not recognize as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
These were created between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical admission of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even if the French troops with the peace of Lunéville of 9. Finally, February 1801: It was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued to push ahead with the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The original position sheet for Munich dates from 1856 and, like everyone else, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison earlier/today is the most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705.
Where today is the West Park, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: At the zooming in, a smaller-part map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered corridor pieces from the so-called "original recording" from which the property tax was derived.
Today, small plots no longer occupy farmers - but small gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" plant.
A large green area is visible north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in the 19th. Century actually still a meadow - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the original position sheet, in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name "am Gasteig" or of the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Insane Institution".
Yes, here on the Auerfeldstraße people were once locked in with delusions.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich district asylum "Auf der Auer Lüften" was built.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden the institution - the psychiatrist who is associated with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of the so-called lunatics.
In addition, he has prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who has dealt with the institution for an exhibition.
There had initially been room for 280 patients, later expanding to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreiserrenanstalt in Haar 1905.
There is the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in Germany, since 2006.
On the site of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football field of the TSV München Ost, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the insane asylum, which had been destroyed in bombings in the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as "Haupt Platz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a medieval tomb chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on the 5. April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared to the aerial photo of today - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled up.
Civil rights group releases travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored Persons has issued a warning to people of color who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and the state's racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which until the 28th. August 2017 is scheduled to come into force, urging African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when traveling through the state and exercise extreme caution, as a series of questionable, racial-based incidents have been occurring across the state recently and noted here," the group's statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies, which are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
"They have violations of civil rights, the people pass.
They are being stopped because of their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet."
It is the first such warning the organization issued for a state in the U.S.
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he stopped gasoline while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri attorney general's office showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be willing whether to bring bail money or let the relatives know they're traveling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which put the state on the 16th in terms of the number of such injuries. Rank of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately, stakeholders have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Pasture fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU members of the Bundestag Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies at the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family.
Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he cultivates 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments.
For him, the "Schwarzwaldmilch" is the alternativeless marketing path for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
Only regional things come to the table of the holiday guests.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementary important".
I cannot operate profitably on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much must be processed with the motor scythe.
"We are struggling with the conditions and with the topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he did not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the leader funding".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that the reforestation of the areas could be pulled out for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they continue to take their business," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often under criticism for the promotion
A total of 25 parcels from eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the granting of the pasture fence.
The open-minded area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half was funded via Leader, a quarter carried by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
For Peter Weiß, too, it was clear: "Best food is produced here".
The Landscape Conservation Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state funding of pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a funding slot designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be tractor-management (tendency over 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by reforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018, the application is currently underway by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The open-minded area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Now Trump's White House is taking the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on Firdo's square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to dramatically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903, 17 years after the memorial was completed.
When Miller acosta berated: "I don't want to go down here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you refer to, which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller is factually right, but as he himself put it, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tires, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable apostasy of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "wretched waste" on our screens was better seen.
Miller wasn't engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's U.S.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over America's importance.
Lazarus - and her friends, who campaigned to place her words at the grassroots after her death - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical visual representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: In her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a completely different name: Mother of the Exiles.
The poem's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change this back for a long time.
The great screaming neck Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but is rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the vast world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.
She is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States.”
Pretty unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The meaning of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It's literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear.
And that, of course, is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
The performance director of the UK's athletics, Neil Black, says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will "make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics has to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we're going to continue to run it until we figure it out," Black said.
"I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they've done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the squad.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible," Black says.
"A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, walked out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great.”
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.
Scotland's best total number of athletes to date at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads along the way and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only be part of the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it very special for me," she added.
"Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to bet on that home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I'm getting a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.'
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't apply for a public office if you can't tolerate the heating up of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long before the newspapers beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are being led to slaughter like the sheep."
That takes me to Maryland to Gov. Larry Hogan, who needs to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Well, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state who is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people coming to the side of the governor - which is a public forum called official and by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment section of the news show "The Post."
"I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people comment on the same topic, then they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective deployment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack" would probably call others "intercession."
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than it was in earlier times if you had done the same thing that employees were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that’s what’s happening digitally.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for berating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week.
Loudoun County's Chairman of the Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Gov. Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of its use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers struck his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that put down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his point of view on the Amity contract, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian the 25th Edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Northern Irishman, who led next door at the Archerfield Link until the finals last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club built, and we see him achieving his fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players will see this course at its best, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he fixed this place.
He is an avid advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course.”
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite winning in his 32-year career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
"This feels really special," the Southport-based player said.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it was special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, the one after his 50. Birthday earlier this year came to the European Senior Tour, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you play at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
"You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad how it went."
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entrance is free, parking costs £5 per car with one occupant and £10 per car with two or more occupants.

Fewer lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke
Over the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of secondhand smoke.
This is the conclusion reached by scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to secondhand smoke," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to secondhand smoke per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections prove to be very complex
The construction work in Villinger Straße is in full swing and "lies reasonably in time," according to the head of the construction yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since there is a lot of hiding in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, is a major problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of the motorists in front of red traffic lights and barrier grids is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the scheduled buses were entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
"The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesian Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai reign in Indonesia's troubled province of Papua, the housewife usually puts a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - right into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and devoured with zealous, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. B. Clothes with cloudy water to wash from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was taken in in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were to vote by a public hand-up in front of the occupation forces.
An existing movement that stirred up for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is dull. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated metal roofs, which have been converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes, too.
"We weren't used to wearing those clothes," Degei says, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
“We used to have only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined US$3.1 billion in gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has timber resources worth an estimated US$78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for the Papuas, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly US$20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to US$150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papua have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970's became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Will Lose Everything," reads a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities from the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of casualties as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people fight to keep up here.
"The migrants have begun selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai local who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura for work.
"It has cost the native Papua - the mom-mum [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations of the law in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua's total of 29 districts - including Paniai - on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But little has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes, that justice will be restored," You says.
In fact, only two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October, Paniai suffered a low point.
On the 7. December 2014 was a group of 11 children outside singing Christmas carols outside a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The startled children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense to their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were chasing and beating the group with their rifle butts, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the children's group.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered on a football pitch outside the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They carried ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in a circle and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began hurling rocks at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated up, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the crowds resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which was not released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the looming danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
The local man, Alfius Youw, was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears just one name, told TIME in a bleak mood.
"I saw he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves if people threaten to kill us," Papua Police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings did not come to Jakarta 'filtered' until the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura expressing sympathies for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historic grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
"Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000's.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to be gone through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he did on the 5th. Speaking to TIME in Jakarta in June, he said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the UN has charged with "crimes against humanity" that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses in Papua had already been settled, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there has been no progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I'm afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings have not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw rocks at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd, killing one.
"We were so panicked, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to the TIME.
"I spent two days hiding in my house."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and the police mobile brigade to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by kick-starting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "securing national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty strengthens discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
People here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work on four or five fields of sweet potato.
They keep the bulk of the crop for the family while the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuas and the new migrants, who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or skills necessary to lead their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting remain tense for international media.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbors of Papua.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "different and widespread injuries" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, a democratic system still applies, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on 4. May visited, locals broke their silence and afflicted him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papuas say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papua, regard their vote for Jokowi as a "guilt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gunshot victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station.
They know that they may never have justice, but at least they will not forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire captures Dubai's 'torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire found its book on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
"We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and screaming the people.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get off the 50. Floor to come down," a resident who gave his name as George recounted Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire around 4:00 a.m. local time (00.00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working on providing accommodation for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior paneling for decoration or insulation.
In Britain, police said they believe the system of panels to insulation and fairing at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed with his major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning sets was wafer-thin not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The often very long, but also very much appreciated five-set classics remain the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted for the reform, the goal of the ITF President David Haggerty was therefore only narrowly missed.
"We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place had not even come to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively minor details: The finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round.
To reduce the cost to the organizers, the requirements in terms of training grounds, etc., will be eased and players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers put banned items on the plane, a survey finds
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had late discovered that they had traveled erroneously with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared with less than 15 percent, who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through the security checkpoint, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had interviewed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many had done it deliberately.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones who fly the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure what fluids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA is prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might see books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric thousand-sad Elon Musk likes to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
He has so far embezzled that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk revealed a different, less brilliant number for the first time when the latest quarterly balance sheet was announced: the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised the new car in recent months with the more than 500,000 pre-orders, the delivery of which is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations would be available, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders so far could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with ambitious growth targets is not demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it will be - all models combined - 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1800 reservations per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never tested in practice production lines without major interruptions with maximum occupancy.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, the non-bindingness of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt is withdrawing to reduce emissions because of delaying Obama-Era rules
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, took back his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the action that had been brought against his previous body in a federal appeals court.
It's about a deadline that comes at 1. October for states expired to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "medging in local decisions or hindering economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt's regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator oversaw his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards quite simply reinforce the EPA's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for execution and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others, and in a settlement to set the date for execution," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
"We don't believe in regulation through legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists for us.”
Nevertheless, the EPO's opinion said that at some point Pruitt will use his "power to delay and all other powers of attorney legally available" to ensure that the regulations are "based on a sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
"The reversal of the EPA -- after our lawsuits -- is a significant gain in health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that pours into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York in this case joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The emerging smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Representatives of public health and environmentalists cheered on Pruitt's surprising change of course.
"It's worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the ideological crusade of the Trump administration to engage in environmental polluters and their special interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will take place on Sunday, 16. July, at 4:30 p.m. invited to a serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth charity serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village has made the friends and patrons of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Documents in a document: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen with the Vogtei on it" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.
According to the wording of the document, on the Tumlinger Berg, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court, to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not vice versa.
There were people living there, too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt from 1858, in addition to the lower village and the upper village, which can still be seen today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
The right of patronage arose from early medieval eigenkirchenrecht.
A gentleman who built, equipped a church and occupied it with a pastor remained the owner of this church and was also able to inherit this own church.
This was linked to the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The greater of the two burst at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell first sounded in 1692, but later had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops were camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823 the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left.
On New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent a disaster, the tower was demolished.
Only the tower dwarf still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Pensioners" as successors to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility.
As organizers, the friends and sponsors of Tumlingen invite on Sunday, 16. July, to the sixth serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program will begin at 4:30 p.m.
Admission is from 15.30.
At the end of the serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers point out the fantastic view.
The serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius system, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and sponsors of Tumlingen are particularly committed to the care of the home, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim resists" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore reached out to the district council.
The association "Boisheim resists" has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was unlawful.
The association argues that at the time of approval on the 30. December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at the time in Viersen only on the city border to Schwalmtal a wind power concentration zone existed.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of the use of wind energy for the rest of the urban area.
Such zones are intended to prevent "asparagus" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier by a change in the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning law requirements, the approval decision granted is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim resists."
Current state of affairs: The city council decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This excludes the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines under planning law at this point".
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the Kreis Viersen since last week," a spokesman explained.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to stop the procedure.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim resists" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households should be able to be covered - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four-households.
NEW Re plans to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen’s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.
Car and tractor crash: Woman dies in terrible accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
One woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police information, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car with her accompanied driving with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and merchants plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping facilities in the city center in September.
The trade association and the city administration want the weekend on 8 and 9. September use to attract residents to the city center for shopping.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize the customers to what offers their own city has in store outside the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market, is planned.
In addition, domestic companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center should invite you to "shop in the middle night".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags, which point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "active day" for the Brunnenfest including Sunday open for sale, discussions with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential should be redeveloped or re-developed.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help enliven the city center - right down to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy, which had partly spread, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities are participating in the third "home shopping" day nationwide for the first time.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities more strongly," according to Streich.
The action under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and with many partners also made it clear that every citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them seriously.
According to the fire department, one injured man was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initially missing person was later also recovered.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people were in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico for paying the border wall after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were released by the Washington Post.
On the 27. January, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president berated him for publicly denouncing the wall. He reportedly told him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border, and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull, that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "bad" and "stupid" and that the insistence on the trade mediated by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dep" after proposing a ban on resettling refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after he told Mr Turnbull "this is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists re-enact racist lynch act as a call for justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled towards Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men with rifles stepped out to block his path.
The mob's leader - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked through the windshield examiningly.
Inside, the inmates were in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man roared.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Thankfully, this terrible scene is the one on the 22nd July was played, just a re-enactment.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost all in the audience uttered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have been coming back to Moore's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really unbelievable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the re-enactment.
"It's a stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he said.
"We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice."
A medical examiner puts a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynch on 27. July 1946.
According to FBI files obtained from the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the lynch actions across the city has always been well known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their votes for the first time in the pre-election campaign in the summer.
About the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor had been in the city that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was wearing was not from her husband.
On the 25. July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they then moved away from prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," concludes an FBI report.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, removing evidence and covering up the identities of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was an election law massacre," he said.
"You've all been killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you get registered and if you vote, then this will happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lynching because then we're confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the black - crowded into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never get easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
"But I think it's very important to keep this story alive because we don't want to return to those times."
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who shouts at Hester and afflicts him, angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
"I said, n --- he, get out of my property!"
Rascona reciprocates fire.
There's a pause.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out in laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," Greene said, still giggling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n --- he's at the time."
"Yes," quipped one of the other black performers.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that's exactly where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman dressed in a mourning dress stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday's grieving eulogy "Strange Fruit."
Her voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance, many just coming down the street.
They have all experienced Georgia’s oppressive moisture for almost eight hours when Brooks takes them to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the bodies.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters, as if to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona hugs two of his teammates and then collapses in their arms crying, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
"We know that's not in your heart.
You did this for a reason.”
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chat excitedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling left by the performance.
"It's hard to hear those horrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching still goes on," she added, "today that's just called a police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks Hof stops at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The re-enactment is inspiring in some ways, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
"It's like this, if we don't learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, those who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it.
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner's monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful-frivolous staging against a gigantic, six-storey backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner including wall rest and doner stall in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it, an open Mercedes classic car, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which runs through its "Ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), dragging a body into the trunk in a Hollywood manner and giving the rioto clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously nasty hague that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutally the scene as he slays Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) must also believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with vigorous applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated stormily, who bows modestly and bows his hands to the Merkel diamond.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which is showing itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat again in casual leisure clothes.
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
If he had to endure a whistling concert in 2013, there was great cheer five years later, in which the isolated "boo" shouts went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner is likely to have been pleased about this.
"You can tell that the audience has grown together with the "Ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but also grew an understanding of his point of view.
I'm drawing a positive conclusion.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I have also worked in the open full day at the school.
What is your experience with it?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 now, so a late volunteer.
How's that coming?
A lot: I did high school diploma.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered, what are you doing.
Do a social year, there is an insight, so you can see how it is on the ground, in the focal point maybe also, really.
And was it?
A lot: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will study dually, probably do a social worker training at the youth welfare office Herne and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
It always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work.
It was very varied for me.
I was also partially in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the thing that appealed to me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Unlike in the civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in mind who have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to respond individually.
Very interesting.
And you didn't have any fear of touch?
Menge: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, a lot of kindness.
There are also negative moments, but that’s the way life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive business
UK education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.
The job cuts, which Director General John Fallon announced predominantly for late 2018 and early 2019, come in addition to its previous restructuring, which already lost 4,000 jobs.
Pearson announced in May in a third cost-cutting program a plan to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million dollars) to revive a business hit by the rapid step to digital learning.
The company, which had divested its stake in Penguin Random House in partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year was unchanged after it posted an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion pounds in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
Unconfirmed local reports also died in the incident in the Qarabagh neighborhood, three civilians.
The bombing is the last act of violence Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A statement from NATO said the explosion happened on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-borne improvised explosive device."
The statement said that all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On 31. Mai killed a huge bombing in the center of the city more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs up to increase the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay regulation of Obama's administration, requiring states to curb smog-causing emissions. This was done a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to advance the so-called "Ozone Regulations 2015," saying it was demonstrating the agency's commitment to cooperate with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to measure ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - to delay one year to October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to scale back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda designed to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, efforts have sparked the setback of Democrats and conservation groups, who are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says that inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and amplify respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Local council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the local council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior living facility.
Before the discussion, there is an important piece of information: The purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area of the church community to be owned, but there is now no longer a planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a community space.
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council envisages not providing such a common room as a meeting place only for the residents of the senior-friendly living, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word of the "knit café" made the rounds.
The decision, which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, will be sweetened by funding opportunities.
The building is in the renovation area.
The establishment of a common room would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor, the proposal for a decision provides that it does not want to throw sticks between its legs in this regard, the finding that both saddles - which is based on the surrounding development - and the lectern roof - would be possible, which reduces the eaves height and makes construction more economical.
Unnecessary, so not only Wilfried Sohmer thinks, is this addition.
If it helps: unanimously he passes the panel.
It is not so easy in the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you can not really move forward, but now you lean out of the window at the common room, she says: "I have a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
She sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a subsidy, but get a real, in case of doubt marketable equivalent, is the counter-talk.
Staiger's request to resolve the proposed decision accordingly finds three proponents.
So it remains with two votes against in the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes as follows: "If we take the decision like this, we make a giant step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: Cyclist is hurled onto road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was captured by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
According to the police, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been on the bike of the road Schwarzer Weg from the direction of Hilden at 12.20 o'clock.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buchholzer Busch.
A female passenger car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, however, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car that a 66-year-old Hilden woman was driving.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to hospital by an air truck.
Bayern Munich must do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Supercup will take place without him: David Alaba must let the game against Dortmund whizz.
With personnel worries, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Super Cup against the Cup winner.
The personnel concerns at the German football record champions Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 pm/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti also has to do without David Alaba in a duel with BVB.
The Italian confirmed this on Friday.
In addition, the Munich Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is the balance in the team.
It was not good last time.”
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
"Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team is showing these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game."
The duel of the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The match is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering in the resin from star to star
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the need for information from many Harz visitors, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "easily accessible installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. would be eligible Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star path train is to be extended by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting facts, for example about the physics of the individual stars," explained the association.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star glows more strongly than another, even though it was much further away.
It is also taught in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best seen.
The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. since 2014. Andreasberg the highest observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can often be clearly seen with the naked eye.
In the university city there has been something similar since 2003 on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen as the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetary Trail.
Beginning in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "alien" location in Diemarden (community of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including the Pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are set exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While the light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another half a year.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future below 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organisation super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you the best of luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
"I've risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I'm not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on 23. September has.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it," Garcia said, later openly expressing herself to fight at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready... "
Garcia said he appreciates Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he will potentially take part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped for the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show batting strength, then boxing.
Both said they could sense the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
"This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and that's Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre burst
In an accident on the A7, four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the Marktbreit junction at about 16.30, probably after a tyre burster.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be routed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-way chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 to the season opener against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation will bring points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, with the result also, had it not been for the two goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too many, and we have to be even better at care in Aue," says the Fortuna Düsseldorf defensive player.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the Fortunes don't want to catch each other either.
"For the future, no one will be standing next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better with the triple chain even after the experience in the preparation than with the chain of four.
"I don't know yet how we're going to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have players who can build well in the triple chain on the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and we don't afford so many play-off errors in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann is also going to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw, does not know.
The performance could be okay," said Hoffmann.
"But if we can stand there on Sunday with four points and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season opener."
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight matchdays," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be canceled prematurely because of a severe weather.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know as 100 percent where they currently stand," says the Fortuna centre-back.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a slight favorite on Sunday in the encounter in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we sweep them away just because we have the claim to get into the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat to Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2. Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and overbearing."
And so Funkel doesn't want to see his players on Sunday.
New results of Swedish asylum age assessment tests released
The latest findings of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden, which has undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested are older than 18. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) has begun carrying out the tests last year.
They are to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migration Verket) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency now has the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31. July 2017 published.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under 18 years old."
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent in the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are pretty consistent," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases where the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that "propose that the person examined was 18 years or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, she found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, have also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the Karolinska Institute's endocrinologist Claude Marcus, whose work includes assessing human biological maturity to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
"I had reason to think about it, and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of incorrectly assessing a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just below 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Roads and Transport department at the Freiburg government office.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge that is covered with red coloured sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 metres.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has become old.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red coloured sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-meter-wide and seven-ton so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fastening, which is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing about this is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberg-based company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of pipes through the building in Lauterbach has required special sensitivity.
This is also where a fiber-optic cable runs, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handouts.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished off first.
For the bridges between the construction yard building and the collective pond in the direction of Schramberg, the traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance, the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is completely closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is together 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), what is otherwise difficult to reconcile comes together.
The parties represented in the district council of Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the according to poster "big campaign kick-off".
And brings well-known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland the top duo for the federal election on 24. September forms, and the deputy Federal Chair Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the Brunnenplatz, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundel - and thus directly in front of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that presents itself.
And what Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the Forum Eine Welt and one of the authoritative organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "primordial German potato salad, which the AfD could also eat without any problems," says the woman who brought him with her.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has tried to make such an event and was awarded the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a rejection there, because because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there were not enough parking spaces.
Now the roundabout, Hompes is pleased that "we can have such a nice event here."
With regard to the event on the Rondell forecourt, he says: "This is the good right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
It also does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the Rondell forecourt, in the Stadthalle various speakers, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officers have had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts just over an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but there is also the day to clean up shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can move away - no special incidents.
Trombone hits trumpet
A rehearsal with the Wolfach trombonest Frederic Belli will be available in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkanfolklore" also meets a classical German education with roots in wind music.
Both soloists are the winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter with the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo posaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to cross the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach resounds with the two as in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echo prize winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free playing combine to create a fascinating work of art.
This core part of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
"Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
"Once I bite in grilled cheese, I think, 'Oh that was cool, what's next?'"
Probably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who ultimately fell bitterly apart.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her split, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not to be taken seriously.”
According to Bang Showbiz, she suffered in particular during school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I was looking like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'Girl, be proud of you!'
She does not like to explain her love life to the public: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some call me ungrateful, but I don't like to have to justify myself to the whole public."
West Virginia Governor announces he is moving the party
. West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can't help you anymore if I'm a Democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to Republicans," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would say it's time to play a different game."
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and has inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about 1.59 billion dollars.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying: "The change of party of Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told the CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
The global head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised Thursday what he described as an overt apology from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated it was not the moment for the country to be accepted back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he was sorry for "all the athletes who were snatched away in gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF president Coe told reporters.
"The entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized on itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is being redesigned."
Coe said he was also "pleased" at Russia accepting the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the task force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
"We need to do everything we can to normalise this situation in the next few months.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the tainted system," he added
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, following the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still had to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug testing is still inadequate and banned coaches are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a talk at the IAAF Council.
Act of mourning for soldiers who crashed in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1000 people remembered the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two killed pilots as the "experts of their field".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hesse had died on Wednesday in West African Mali a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of Sankt Peter on Thursday accompanied by a Bundeswehr wake.
At noon, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
Afterwards, the funeral ceremony began in the circle of the family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the inspector general of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Mourners laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defense Minister von der Leyen described the perished soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced.
The chief of staff helped set up the flight operations of the Tiger attack helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to do it".
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they are buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
The royal family said on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
He has no intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After ascending the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also resigned the title "Prinzgemahl".
Since Henrik did not get the title and the function he wanted in Denmark, he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after the death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
He did not intend to be buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for the last 50 years.
Born in Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, Margrethe met in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always flew to the expressions of sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult stand in his almost 50-year reign among the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik said of the first years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticised.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knit socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation in this country for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for leniency.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
That was two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP facing possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a rapid new election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Weil spoke out in favour of the dissolution of parliament on Friday.
Previously, the surprise withdrawal of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to take them in.
Thus, the CDU and FDP together have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, SPD and Greens 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been the other way around.
The new state parliament will be regular on 14. January next year elected.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, thinks it is essential that the Landtag decides on its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament will deprive the prime minister of confidence and choose a successor.
"Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be legally cleanly examined," Thümler said.
"You will quietly discuss all questions if they are legally reasonably tested."
Thümler called Twesten's move "but somewhat curious."
The politician herself stressed: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MPs to return their state parliament mandate.
"We naturally assume that she will return her state parliament mandate, which she received via the green state list, with immediate effect," the state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Korner said in a statement.
Green Group leader Anja Piel said: "We extremely regret the decision of Elke Twesten".
She had deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step."
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the conversion of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters, but also betrayal of Red-Green," the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the state parliament.
The withdrawal of Twesten costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician "puts in her hurt vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this dirty game of intrigue and is trying to make political capital out of it."
Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The SPD's parliamentary leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mr Schmidt, How can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp imprint.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarning.de, the federal states set the latest information about the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Is Aldi now taking on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the Enlightenment is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the task of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately opened up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the concern of Germany became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The same as the manufacturers must ensure that the products sold are roadworthy and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg has been exceeded for eggs, they are not marketable.
Unencumbered eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time it is not the companies' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to current knowledge, the production companies are not directly responsible.
Rather, they must expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is it only lacking in the staff or also in the conclusive competence?
It was precisely the official checks that uncovered the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
Precisely for this reason, a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to the public prosecutor’s offices in cases in which crimes can be present are of decisive importance.
I have already made it clear several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and marketable food.
When an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Due to the panicked means, manufacturers, distributors and consumers have fallen into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the keeping of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be worked on consistently and at high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unhindered spending by European football clubs, will not bother Neymar's world record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, because the senior organisation that has monitored the European match the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules, launched by UEFA in 2011, mean PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without much loss.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million $) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen up the money so that Neymar signs and takes him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding by the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had incurred enormous debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from the focus on clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - was to become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini has fallen out of favour with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to campaign to deter from excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a lump sum, it can distribute the amount for the accounting over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the transfer amount for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014/15 season remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial oversight by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not consider this a legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could simply be found out for UEFA regulators.
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to pay attention to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA have not had any preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be released.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and she tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," La League president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is in possession of an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations about a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the past 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
"As soon as a country has a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new chocolate supplier
In recent years, Chocolat has produced Frey on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is facing a possible end: The airline is re-exposing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report by the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" on Friday at the request of the news agency sda.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-white packed chocolate plates of 14 grams are distributed to the passengers each year before landing.
Swiss did not want to provide any information on the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: For a chocolate manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new call for tenders.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss signed a contract with Migro's subsidiary, Barry Callebaut, in collaboration with Hug, had delivered the chocolate tablets.
Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the Sprungli confectionery, in business class, passengers snacking on Schoggi von Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short haul, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion is competing for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters away, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This rerun of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90's grunge era (when thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables that of H. Jon Benjamin was spoken).
By stiffening to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they still managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the watering can principle, including a reef on the stalker films of the 90's such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The Amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now novelist, hasn't forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau) yet.
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-malign plot into which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, the now by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black) is supported.
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun, the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard of "Singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he achieves what I assume as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gangs as she will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, recalls a different kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans," the movie "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-V-V-West wrestling iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as the director claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-pressed Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some beautiful gags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," who has been redacted to a lesser length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a charament.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with their own.
Blow to drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor's office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused persons between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officers ensured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
In simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.
The two will therefore probably be extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, over 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, as well as robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor’s office in Konstanz has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Rottweil crime scene had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation was also accompanied on Wednesday morning by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations were mainly targeted by Italian nationals with close connection to the Italian Mafia.
Also an incident on 27. May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the account of the gang.
Weise laments major gaps in foreigner register
"Data from citizens who should not show up": According to a report, the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to serious wrong decisions in asylum proceedings.
The commissioner for the refugee management of the federal government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, has drawn attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners, according to a media report.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to asylum proceedings and deportations "partly to serious wrong decisions," Weise warned in an analysis, which is available to the "Süddeutsche Zeitung".
The register includes ten million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register."
"Incorrect data inputs can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
In the statistics on people who are obliged to leave, EU citizens are also included, who do not have to leave at all.
However, such incorrect assignments "led to a distorted debate about the handling of those obliged to leave," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the German government has apparently begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back back to Italy when they have entered from there.
This is according to an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung".
The paper said the BAMF had such procedures "related to families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - after Italy since 1. June 2017 again through".
Since the end of 2014, this has practically no longer been possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
According to the Dublin Agreement, the EU state is responsible for refugees, which they reach first.
If a migrant travels to another EU country, that state can send him back to the country of entry.
As a justification, the office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin agreement.
The domestic policy spokeswoman of the Left faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children threaten because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system against human rights violation conditions and a threat to the child's welfare".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach was already provided by the blood donation service for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Above all, Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, the congregation in the meeting of the local council pays tribute to the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our bodies are laid out for this and we pay respect to the donors, who provide their blood for strangers, in addition unselfishly," emphasized Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the head of the district readiness of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the canned food is decomposed into its components.
So even three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, with 114 donors, we achieved the second-best result," the DRC county readiness manager said.
Obviously, the move to the Theaterhaus a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.

The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the slowdown in inflation dampened speculation of a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "low" when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressures.
The Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) policymakers voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking an increase this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But it signalled that interest rate hikes would become necessary in the next few years to curb inflation fuelled by Brexit and she said credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic recovery package issued a year ago after Brexit.
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more under this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling.
Minutes after deciding on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
On interest rates, it reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly greater" extent than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are up to 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the 1.9% forecast in May.
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after those news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to US$1.31 and fell 0.4% to US$1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor pay rises, as the tightening will get worse first before it then improves.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income slump in the next few years, but it added that wages will recover "significantly" at the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also being boosted by rising demand for UK goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates it will probably take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Before the bank's final ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation boosted pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation has fallen to 2.6% in the past month from 2.9% in June, although the bank said this was expected and it will tighten again in the coming months.
The bank said the overrun in relation to its 2% target was "entirely" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders loudly look for deals and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market is looking particularly good for those where the existing deals are phasing out and the new mortgages are closing, and many with royalty-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (The National Health Service) is to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before sexual intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 per cent, is now being delivered by the health service over an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeals upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called this a "decisive moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV supplements taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there is just enough medication in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants who agree with the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment, are identified.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP may also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week following international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on a large scale, how it is targeted, recorded and implemented.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity's biggest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if it is specifically targeted at people in need and vulnerable, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is conducted quickly across the country and that no one who is at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us get one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.
Living the big life: Mezzanines and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, edged up from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," Joanne says.
"I was looking for something comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - one had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine floor to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about putting the steel on it so that it had the right height for the above or below function.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height on top of each other - with plenty of extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units can accommodate all of Joanne's cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A little bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
"It's counterweight so that when you push the door up, it slides very easily."
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you'll sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."
Here they have managed to increase the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help create an emotional attachment in a home," Erfan says.
"You don't fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn into something quite amazing due to good design and increased square footage of something standard.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave these.
Brothers fight over a US$500 million property empire
Two brothers are in an altercation over 500 million dollars worth of Victoria in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires four decades after her Italian family founded the dynasty.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how her property and business assets should be divided.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Along with her mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a business on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold in 1999 for US$85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and shopping centres in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court file states that this means that Colin owns property worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth 176 million dollars.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem point for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which, as Paul claims, has ruled him out.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage mandates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessens from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.
Both Lukas and Mark have, Paul says, have been "embittered by the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back a lot despite being a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded via text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and pull our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John can F. Kelly actually does.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media's reports - in hopes of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"As John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior executives on his first day at work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that falls into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he received good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television ad is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs that were convincing," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes steady praise."
Okay. Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don't know - that Trump's tweets would have contained even more igniting matter without their interventions.
We'll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn't send.
If his employees have managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts have paid off.
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that the people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that potentially promotes their views from the world.
Politico - all this history - reported in May about the advisers' preference to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano, can respond to negative press clippings, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffening to find out where these come from.
This is exactly what happened in late February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, gave, who accused deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a pile of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started interviewing staff about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House secretary general Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly is trying to do the same thing three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These unchanging factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the searched serious criminals are naturally not known, indications from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar of winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives hide in holiday destinations, Europol said.
21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries have been compiled.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online wanted could be arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of indications after publication on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the 'millionaires' series'
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again on war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch drawn from the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy road from Solihull, which is called the "Millionaires series."
They have brought in horses, babies and an army of vans after being kicked out only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that went unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have afflicted Solihull's advice, who said it was "useless to deal with the issue."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw rocks at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced to implement it by shame, since it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably even more today.”
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instruction to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop that."
One local resident, who did not want to be named, said: "It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travelers, just to be plundered by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area."
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police force. We are taking the necessary legal action to allow them to move on as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case."
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to take place on 1. Will reopen March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH at 13. At that time, around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost in April 2014 and also revenue from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not without controversy in the local council at the time.
But especially Freudenstadt's Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time.
He should be right.
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise again.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction debris containers have been in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot of work to be done by March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in an interview with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are included.
One does not want to position oneself on the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set itself up wide, explains Scherer.
Both individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are consistent with those of the hotel group.
"We're on the same line."
Asked about the amount of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself exactly.
Just under one million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also being brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace will be built, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: US special prosecutor deploys grand jury
In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special Counsel Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of specifically interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation will focus on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican during the election campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also took more and more a close look at Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special prosecutor had personally put Trump in the center and investigated the accusation of whether the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of grand juries is to examine existing evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called prosecution chambers.
They are mostly involved if they are major and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be involved by the public prosecutor's office to subpoena people for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign chief Paul Manafort were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said on U.S. television on Thursday night that the establishment showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be involved at the end in order to decide on the filing of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"Russia history is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to "feel good because they have nothing else to talk about."
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing about the appointment of a grand jury.
But this also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House advocates any measures that accelerated the special prosecutor's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI chief James Comey has said three times that the president is not being investigated.
There was no reason to assume that this had changed, the statement said.
Mueller, however, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this ejection, accusations against Trump had become loud that he had wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him for a halt to the investigation into then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the inquiry.
According to US media, the White House collected material against the special prosecutor and his staff.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to sack Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special prosecutor, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Justice Department at the insistence of the president.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday that the special prosecutor could no longer be dismissed so easily.
Antarctica: Gigantic iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In the West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than one trillion tonnes and is 5800 square kilometres in size, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
A danger to people does not come from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region for around 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now aborted colossus was so far a part of the Larsen-C ice cream.
Ice shelf swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It thus continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down.
The Larsen-C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf was the balance of waxing and breaking off a few years ago disturbed.
A complete ice shelf has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C ice cream is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it currently is.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not raise sea levels because they float on the water and ice displaces as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C ice shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometres, according to AWI data.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it regularly breaks down.
"Although it is a natural happening and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Britain's Swansea University.
"This is the furthest withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it is controversial whether the Larsen-C ice shelf will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, his colleague Adrian Luckman said, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable".
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends to South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is rising the fastest.
CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for the employers' association to withdraw in order to become more attractive.
Only shortly before the summer break, the district council waved through 41 new positions in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very much sought-after.
Around 620 applications were made for the places to be allocated this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to be able to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unfilled positions at the Mettmann district.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration are being sought.
The CDU would now like to take the initiative in the district council together with the FDP and the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
The administration is to "work out a concept for recruiting staff and personnel development" according to the parties' wishes.
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
It sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities recruit good civil servants and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a veritable "competition of public employers".
In addition, there are a high number of employees who are out of the service due to illness or age.
It is therefore high time to act so that even more jobs do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, parliamentary group leader of the CDU, goes with his party beyond the joint motion.
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the district council, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost cap and amazed the other parties.
Völker wants all possibilities to be reviewed that allow an exit from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration should seek a domestic tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-affiliated cities," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and civil servants better than the tariff regulations for the public service actually provide.
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitute protection law.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and county director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens tone on NGO migrant rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat run by the German aid organization 'Jugend Rettet' because their crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on detailed allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess any allegations that are being made after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation."
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is thought that his crew will take inflatable migrants on board, who will be delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers will be able to depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons rather than any other motives.
Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must mainly have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "substantial changes or disabilities" of their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants these countries are leaving in the hope of being able to reach Europe.
Climbs and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Außenposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
There were three friends guides available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
This was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the salt pan and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoint lined up at vantage point, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many meters of altitude were again announced.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refreshment huts brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the open-air inhalatorium breathed healing brine.
Neustadt was also approached.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest at its best - sportingly and culturally.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles in the future instead of fighting their way across the stadium lawn in wind and weather?
The fact is: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg made its start in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says board member Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that on this train still several clubs ascend".
Next weekend, FIFA will organise the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, in which the gamers of various clubs will compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven, for example, have qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football in particular has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present online far more often in these markets than sending the Bundesliga team to Asia only once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea certainly takes some getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast responsiveness.
Professional gamers should train not only at the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more of an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the structures of classic sport were lacking in the scene.
The scientist emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are on the road internationally, this is like a large global family, there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, the turnover is expected to be 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is indeed little.
However, e-sports is "not far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte advisers.
Internationally, many countries are already further along.
Major markets are Asia and the U.S., where ex-basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the football first division clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia only, and to transfigure the old times, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
"You can't hold on to the fact that only football has everything that always has been."
Poison Eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal of poison-polluted eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs from the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that have been proven to contain no fipronil are to be taken on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of the lyrics that are pushing Conrad Roy to commit suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on parole.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent homicide by Conrad Roy, who turned himself in on the 13th. July 2014 took the life.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with her hands folded and eyes facing down when she was convicted.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She ended his life to make her own better.
She didn't take responsibility," she said.
"She didn't show any remorse."
But Carter's attorney said it was a "horrific circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity level or even her mental illness has a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said there is "no day when I don't entrust the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity," it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she would be "tracked" by the realisation that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"No longer having that single person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as there is no Massachusetts law that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text releases revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hing yourself up, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are a lot of ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before he died while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote: "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention from the death of Roy and ordered that she benefit from the case through some press.
The case has shared legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lame
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern trust the Confed Cup winner a big season - extra motivation does not hurt.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But since on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer, he made the bandage assigned to him stop.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner recounted afterwards, after his first assignment as Bayern captain.
Well, the start could have gone better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich that way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen in the professional consisting of youth players, debutants and just from the holiday as a captain, but he.
Zuckerl is the preferred to distribute to those you trust a lot, who you want to keep happy.
So if you have been chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm, you can only use a small extra motivation.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flitted across the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that's his position now, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And in this starting formation, Kimmich seemed like the one who can also take the helm best in his hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unrehearsed squad.
He had the eye for the whole, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal by overplaying his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches, on devil come out to the performances of the Asia trip (only worked out to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle not to stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both of whom acted confidently.
The well-known Napoli storm often had a hard time, in addition, Süle also tried to play a few times successfully in the game construction.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result "was not as we hoped."
But he, too, put in a decent performance on debut.
Game shift, change of pace: "I was brought in for this style".
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the new additions, you could see after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but determinedly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new teammates.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he no longer has to teach the newcomers that.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is almost a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is thrilled with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
The famous Bayern-Dusel might well need our ladies.
Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often unforgiving, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V's request - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: The gap closure of the Autobahn 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s list of priorities.
This year, the Ministry is hoping for a planning approval procedure, by 2021, the construction law should stand.
The western bypass of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Route Plan, also plays a role in the plans of the country.
The aim is to put the line into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a guide to support regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier is, as suggested by Wissing, aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label in wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been slumping for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees the new master bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is planned for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years after the master training.
The homework list for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, facts can be created quickly, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing intends to hire at the state-owned company Mobility, only 29 have been filled so far.
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU parliamentary group vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus is also expecting a concept from the country on how it intends to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had rated the grid supply in an IHK survey only with a grade of 3.4.
They complained about stalled Internet connections and abortions.
Former Minister of Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field again after four months due to discrepancies.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - carmakers face backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European carmakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to car manufacturers to install facilities to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which could reduce the use of so-called shut-off devices, which could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen were charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in Audi's engine development was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also participate, a raft drives through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If it draws again to the Isar on Saturday, there will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And this is not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a great information transparent.
It shows a mountain of garbage.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar as a worthy wild river should sharpen.
Already last summer, the raft drove over the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's tuber noses and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoonists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: laughter, "for there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4. Born in Buenos Aires in 1932, the son of Spanish immigrants.
In the first years as an artist, he fought his way through, among other things, as a draftsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost in my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures frolic in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he still sits at the drawing table today, works almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to find a lot of distribution worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the movie "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - which has a centipede as an opponent.
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange to me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he's more relying on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that he is at risk of climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of disease-borne insects, which is causing scientists and farmers trying to find solutions a big headache.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in previous years, which brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the fall.
This has an impact on the life of lavender.
There is also a small cicada, a microbacterial that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
Solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowing down of evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in Rhön, Thuringia, celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Scrapers, guilds, traders, vagants or a Landsknechtslager are to be experienced in the city center on these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Staff at the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the government's payroll or the cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are in it: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is her editor and her inspirer from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, though his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are heartbroken and although the terrain is now even more treasonous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we’re all distrusting.”
On the morning of the 15. May, Valdez left the Riodoce newspaper's office in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and shot at him 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which translates to "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a woman and two grown children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot in the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings larger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" when only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States.
Still, and despite Valdez's awareness of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is shattered with the blame for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
Initially, there was the publication in February of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newsstands.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold US$50 in stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hit investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
"You have to take on the task you assign as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun-bird who could curse like a dockworker, the friend generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for routine his desertion?
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job and stay alive in the process.
"You don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things were not allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting his own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, that "smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce staff met for safety training, no cell phones were suddenly allowed. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40°C) in the shade of a tree.
They were mandated by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a middle-class district of Culiacan.
Half in a joke, some of the reporters wondered if those officers are among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending that focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite restaurant of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled all political levels for almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this local, including one where a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just a few months earlier, readers would have considered Valdez's column the best-informed source about the kidnapping.
"We would have known earlier what happened," Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature, said.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning about another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacan three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is gone in Washington and is trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked for her to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under one roof with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officers last year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Clearly, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez addressed the drug cartels publicly with a front-page editorial title entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even from the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who are staying behind and continuing the work, it is a daily dance with high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office drinking beer when all of a sudden everyone began to hum their phones.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb, they have posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who were keeping guard to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when, on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as the "Mona Lisa the Dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had had something of a "restless past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armoured dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21. March 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, grub.
He encountered something that seemed to be misplaced by the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) earth lump.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you just blink your eyes a little bit, you could almost believe it slept," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that even though covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, this herbivore was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered counter-shading, a common defense method in the animal kingdom, meaning the top of the creature was darker than its subpage.
Although counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from flesh-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the obfuscation of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most of the contemporary animals that use counter-shading -- think of deer, zebras or armadillos -- are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur's skin was reddish brown.
Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his conserved bowel content, to find out what it ate as his last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it was driven into a river and driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the seabed.
At the time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida was today, and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved scaly skin, but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early Cretaceous period.
You don’t need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe he's sleeping."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs, crisscrossed the Earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on the 21st. March 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, grub.
According to the museum, it is the world's best-preserved armored dinosaur, including skin and armor, and is completely from snout to hip.
The creatures were, on average, about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips that loomed from its shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until an overflooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified residues of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole.'
In the thunderstorm: Mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-Munich (A8) motorway, about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage late on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, had crashed into each other during a thunderstorm between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district).
Initially, no information was available on the exact number of injured.
It was minor to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backwater of around ten kilometres was formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive obstructions on the oncoming road - by numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted down the license plates of the drivers, who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45, a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It's a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing suspected you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are immersed in your work and you have a brilliant thought.
And then: puff.
If the conductor comes and wakes you up rudely or rips the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creative-free ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take up your place and thus validate the ticket.
A test operation is currently running on two routes.
"Is the offer coming, let's expand it.
It is then expected to be available early next year on many more long-distance routes in Germany," a rail spokesman said.
"Comfort Check-in" the railway calls the ticket cancellation without conductors.
In order to use them, however, some prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers already do anyway.
You also have to buy it via the app of the railway, which DB Navigator has bought, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking the ticket.
And finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call your ticket under "My Tickets".
For the test customers, a button for electronic devaluation will appear.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at the ticket checkpoint in place Y, he knows that there is a passenger with already validated online ticket.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, stay silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the railway - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control through our train attendant, simply check in at the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their journey time on the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, marketing board member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs".
Those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, the ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document that you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in the control of his own ticket and takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet activated.
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On the 9. In August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City, she was sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"Police just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still lying in the street," it said.
Confused, since no one else on her feed had posted the information, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the Handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of tweeting live the deaths of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped off her phone to return later in the evening to tweets about people on the Canfield drive.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, who was carrying a sign that read: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching a live feed in which a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer scorned his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to... Animals kill everyone.”
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
"This is not the kind of murder we've gotten used to and can typically call."
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and I was crying.”
She booked a flight back and went home the next day.
After landing at 2pm, she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in theaters starting at 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience that consists of the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had “about the black experience and the black state” countless times before that morning.
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a high point of what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only know activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and black condition, and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black women's child.
I feel like I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it.'
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location across from the police department that became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-indictment from Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter linked to a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
"My activism has after 9. August totally changed," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association was and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, a field-range artist known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
"That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that's how I'm going to be portrayed."
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - she proved to be the film's most open participant.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" show Surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and her wife marries.
"I felt like I was naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
"It's no coincidence, even though she was at the forefront because there's so much at stake in a life at those intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of the blocking of a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a song and she feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
"It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery moves people, even though it is far from built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has split the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the subject hardly one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say about the Bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "No human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Delusion of size!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents are relying on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the Bauernmarkthalle stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of the construction work will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with possibility, to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping in the Bauernmarkthalle almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the rural women again and again very much.
We also discovered the butcher shop for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
There are in other cities, too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
But it is unlikely to be low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There are already enough of them in our city.
You can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a decent weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved for us.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special business and what is left of it will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit in with Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie already manage to distribute all shops from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "That just won't work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my view, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmers market hall, there is no place to do without meaning in Bitburg thanks to the insanely many - I think - senseless construction projects.
When the farmers market hall is ruined, a piece of culture will disappear again.”
A fitting similarity: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which almost imperceptibly resemble each other - that hang on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek swabs and haircuts, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after making public classified diplomatic reports on the website WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which will take place on 2. August was opened, is A Becoming Resemblance (A suitable similarity).
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and from which 30 portraits were created, what someone might look like with these genomic data, has created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which to interpret and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits visibly unwell in a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals, who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which predicted a future in which the president would convert Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy gathering.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her outsized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly sophisticated scientific encyclopedia) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.
"What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a room of its own, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novella.
She shows Manning showing up like King-Kong with a hands-free phone in her hand from the United States disciplinary cannabinoids.
"If they put your speech down, they won," it reads.
"So never mouth."
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
"I still get goose bumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacs, who gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, as everything in the exhibition, up to size (5" 2, Manning's stature), in which her genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had her on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits said.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that was forming with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation."
University of Northwestern professor and an Oxford University employee wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee wanted as suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was stabbed to death with fatal injuries.
On Monday, arrest warrants were issued for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau issued, as the Acts of Cook County District Court show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, passed away after several stitches.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was on the 27th. July was discovered.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene of the incident, and detectives are investigating the stabbings as murder as police actively search for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem had now been on leave and banned from entering Northwestern University's campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investigators in any way possible."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chicago Police Department Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly urged the suspects to face authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building who had just received an enigmatic tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
Police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident was also on the 27th. July took place.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code, which describes the criteria for re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria set out in the list finds that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: "We are carrying out the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted to a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we're not going to admit something that doesn't exist.'
Mutko's words matched those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russia's sales outlet Sport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was banned from carrying out doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA was moving "in the right direction" to be reinstated.
Aldi is no longer selling eggs for now
This was announced by the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure, it can continue to be assumed from no health impairment, the communication said.
From now on, only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, who have been proven to have tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-lice.
Aldi wants to establish clarity and transparency for its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if she promised anonymity, some workers didn't trust the process.
"There just was never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new race of human resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target special groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the Board of Directors directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is that Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it provides a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill back, why.
Companies are coming to realize that workplace culture must remain at the forefront of workplace culture so that you don't become the next Uber to be involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion worth in 2020, according to the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in discredit.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous texting hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and chief executive of Convercent.
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company's headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to pursue the complaints of staff.
Now that the company is deploying Convercent, issues previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states -- such as discrimination, harassment or unfair practices -- can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
"And we protect our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time for the "social media to come to their right" that companies realized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and burden the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have both supported start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in financing in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all of the capital to $47 million.
Glitter secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing its total funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel their voices belong to, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if a company's managers don't take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
"Because if you don't follow, employees will wonder, "Did you really hear me?
Are you taking care of this?
And if you don't care, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who is now conducting monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the issues through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better bonding of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose companies.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's up to 23 o'clock when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour practice before returning to Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"That's a real treadmill for the guys for the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned out Tuesday.
The NCAA is eliminating two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until Friday's final.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after last season and conducted practical exercises during summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises during the course of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA's rule change, even if it added another point to the players' busy routes.
"We put this enormous burden on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep placking, they're great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great.'
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of view of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale hotel already pelted with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once those rooms are available during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"This is a real problem, and it's not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then setting out to record an exercise there.
If you have the videotape from an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best we can with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan.”
Facebook seeks to intensify fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fact-checkers from third parties and then report their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers who will potentially view results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May, and Germany is backing a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings as they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact review would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing which stories are being contested by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In its recent past, little Scotney Castle has appeared in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopha-lazy Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who's been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes' first book based on an archive: He wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he were there himself.
I love archives!"
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overrated my welcome a little bit"), this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the castle's many treasures and curiosities, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and started writing."
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archives, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree that two families fought for.
Boys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse itself in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" Rhodes says.
"The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit priest, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th. Century is depicted, which staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, repeatedly taking on debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them to myself as a bunch of handsome boys, with a talent for recruiting heiresses.
After the end of his assignment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has put behind him a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämänmäki, the grounds of an early 20 sanatorium. Century that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf veiled
With the concealment of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, as the highlight of the campaign, there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too nice for us.
Or?" the makers of the action ask since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, which was unlocked yesterday.
"But we are using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it reads.
"It is important to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point."
After all, she is in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a medium five-figure amount of its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara discusses retirements and promotions in the Officers Corps.
So also this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff, as it used to be, but in the prime minister's office.
The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs have now also taken part in the discussions, chaired by the Head of Government.
Thus, the civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff General Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
Against 486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt, is being negotiated in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the attempted overthrow as a "gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But does Erdogan really have the army under control?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters."
In the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
The big clean-up in the army and the security forces continues anyway.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 public servants fired by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.
It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the actual masters of the country.
Three times they putthed, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is specifically pushing ahead with an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" warned an unnamed officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance after the purges about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes the rules for the green card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
He envisages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and backed by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
"This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are issued green cards."
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump, quoted by the American media, said.
Ministry to refurbish track for Rennsteig shuttle
In recent months, there has been a dispute over the future of the Rennsteig shuttle - now it should be very fast.
Before the end of the year, the ailing route on which the tourist railway runs is to be built.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is to begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to further order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," explained Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
He estimated the cost of repairing the line at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future, is currently being finalized, Sühl explained.
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway as operators are already in agreement on the technical details.
"This means that the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This will regularly order the Rennsteig shuttle on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a railway connection between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, which is particularly popular with tourists.
In recent months, it had been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly again in the future.
The route is also highly dilapidated in parts.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People are making fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we're going to see them much more often," Mr. Sharkey said at the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human responses achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs, selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails.
But it's getting even more disturbing, as many robots own the "personalities" who would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as adapted to your personality as much as possible," enthuses True Companion's website.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood!"
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female traits, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step towards Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, worry you the most.
On his website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but to men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a Roxxxy?" the website reads.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will, of course, not hold sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they still remain tentatively on the verge of consumer culture.
But what leaks from the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots appear at a time when women’s rights are at risk worldwide, where there is a president in the White House who has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
The most deterrent aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Report of the Maid') are not the graphic images, the engulfed bodies and the cut-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but right now this doesn't feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to mimic the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a backstory, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: maid
Trump's great accomplishment?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the U.S. electorate have also divided small-scale families.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We're all supposedly trying to get our filter bubbles burst.
Less noticeable is the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his antics will no longer repel us.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who suddenly appear as the epitome of reasoning compared to his standards.
I find myself affected nowadays by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in fact, occur as a very mild offense compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in the city, we took our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Park Department, and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are gnushy and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the clinking music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines are becoming too familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a large roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40's and everyone has a great time.
If I could have rated the merry-go-round, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pull through my credit card.
In the coffee house on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store was apologetically grinning, while I tired of having the experience of handing her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treating cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to the prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shoting her several times through a door of the toilet cubicle at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nighttime intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal against Pistorius's six-year sentence this time, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer finds Arnold a strange egg
As the last of the Blumberg schools, the fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and the secondary schools.
In the future, three of the dismissal students will go to high school, four to the secondary school.
Headmistress Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released to freedom.
In addition, the lively group performed a musical entitled "Der Adler im Hühnerhof".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was smashed, the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, grades three and four showed a chicken dance in the rehearsal of Yvonne Frank.
The hens danced with the young bells, which cylinders carried, around the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmistress Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but is part of it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His destiny is to be free.
She wished every fourth grader to feel accepted in his new school.
This was followed by a thank you to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in the event of teaching bottlenecks, and the parent representatives.
The chick season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She does not like to sack her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she could rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all students heard a song of summer time and holiday season.
Great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been jailed for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of 1. August was arrested in Sithonia by police a group of illegally tenting people, including the two Bulgarians.
On the same day, they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The State Department reported bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and impose significant fines on anyone found in a place not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates before only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given a precise date.
Daimler has said it will contact everyone affected.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within their scope.
How long are the conversions likely to drag on overall?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on political pressure.
"For we have seen that automakers are not voluntarily acting on the issue of the environment so far."
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
Time-consuming could be getting an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises waiting.
Foreign manufacturers would probably follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But especially in the regions where driving bans are threatened.
In rural areas, there are no losses in value for older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the award winners doesn't want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honorees this year.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony along with his wife, Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, has already announced that he will refrain from participating in the gala.
He told The New York Times: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even depriving them of the means – and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed she would use the conversation with Trump to make her point of view clear.
After the former President John F. Kennedy-named Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, is retiring next year.
The position is already advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city master builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that no application has yet fulfilled the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.
Thus, in compliance with the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an induction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding degrees.
Because the city definitely wants to keep this function.
If they could no longer fill these out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working atmosphere and a good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure about the construction office and its staff.
But varied projects are also on the agenda in the future: The redesign of the former Hukla site and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzig Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will be worth around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun.”
In terms of design, there is great scope for a city builder.
With Haslach's own building yard and nursery, many things can be reacted to quite flexibly.
"You can make a lot of difference," says Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is a listed building as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city master builder bears a high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything runs over my table."
With support and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been there for ten years, Manfred Schöner (deep construction) for 15 years.
Wacker also wishes that his successor will remain a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the position".
Because continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to complete a degree in architecture as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building regulations and construction planning law.
The city construction office is subject to building construction and civil engineering, construction planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the municipal properties, municipal depot with construction yard and city gardening as well as Lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway line closed
According to police, the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the train track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are walking out of two male offenders and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the scene of the crime, a pink scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a prank on louse," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement traffic, penalties of the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "significant" sum is to be expected, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway could be routed without obstructions.
Almost ten passenger trains were cancelled on Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not fall out, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurring or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestines patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not enter the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated for by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, this can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells.
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment when the same system also works in humans.
The postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, but which was housed separately, did not have this.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi who normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The mice's intestines were DNA-sequenced and six species of bacteria were found present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing without them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells originated.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3lactic acid.
If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have signed a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, a "genius" has signed with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's 40 million pounds signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira advanced at will.
However, Matic had been barred from the Blues' pre-season tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him be ready sooner than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of fulfilling three of its four priority new commitments.
"To get three out of four, for that I thank the club," he added.
"I'll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they've put in a lot of effort."
Boeing 'paints' Dreamliner in the sky
U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky.
The pilots flew off from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and dragged on the US in the form of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had already done such advertising earlier.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin before elections with a certain concern.
Only no disturbances from the party headquarters, just no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the election campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds in the beginning.
It was low blows.
One by one.
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise factional exit of a Greens MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
Greens federal executive Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," the federal executive and campaign manager of the Greens told the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
"All this must not be true," sighs an SPD campaigner, when the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is without a government majority after the conversion of the Green MPs Elke Twesten to the CDU.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly marked defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A black eye, nothing more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then - and everything got much worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tumble, the Düsseldorf bankruptcy knocked the party around smoothly.
The comrades were painstakingly rappelled again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just drawn new courage, the G-20 summit came from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD state leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was burning.
And because in crisis communication afterwards he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Scholz has been fighting for his political survival ever since.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW emissions affair and its role on the supervisory board, the Lower Saxony prime minister has been under criticism for a long time.
Lousy poll numbers were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, Weil has tried more and more in recent weeks to set accents in the federal government.
The quest of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was also not hidden by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They had him granted, as they promised themselves a stabilization of the party from Weil.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is basically not to blame for the internal party conflict of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And Schulz certainly not.
In the meantime, the comrades therefore strive to keep their own rows closed.
Her anger is directed at the Greens, and here especially the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and democracy-damaging how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," Matthias Miersch, head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group, tells the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Ms Twesten was elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be for her to return her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The will of the voters four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU deputy distorts the election result," Oppermann said.
He called for the background to be cleared up.
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for town centre III
If you want to renovate your old house, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what had happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the renovations so far are a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to promote interior development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On the 4. April the Karlsruhe Regional Council received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amount to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
According to Schindler, it will be examined where the "really old" houses are.
But it also plays a role whether there is any interest in the planned area to renovate.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then also shift again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in the context of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of the infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out object-related, that is, per plot.
The rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as the statutes.
The approval period for the funding has been running since 1. January 2017 until 30. April 2026.
Until September this year, however, the inventory would first be carried out, in the context of which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the by-laws should be taken as far as possible, so that the renovations can be started next year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the above-mentioned preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban planning grievances and deciding when to remediate and to what extent.
A renovation notice will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann will come to Empfingen again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that the participation of the parties involved is a key success factor for the project.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the intentions to renovate.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing form", information on the size, distribution and residents of a living space can be provided.
The blue "company arc" must only be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of the funding works according to the "sighthound principle" - whoever comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown to make a renovation "tasteful" to those present.
British inventor puts himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand gesture
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand gesture.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He's got himself with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultative anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, joined forces to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standard.
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on houses and cars to be compatible with the chip, all for an extra charge of £300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built in both home and his BMW Z4 technology, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to US$24,000, according to the military's data left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board was the centerpiece of the event on the 17th. July at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift truck.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The message indicated that the helicopter was on 17. July around 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. arrived, and remained until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of hours of service.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the period.
The records made available to TIME did not clearly show whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked if the event could violate the determination.
"A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus to the reform of health care reform underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government rules.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But to request their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane provided taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is enthusiastic about the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials," White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to drop the US president at the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidential support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to hourly rates from the U.S. Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per hour of flight.
Unit records record the plane's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"The cost to taxpayers based on the estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
"These estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds."
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's deployment for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing tricky task
The frontrunner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga will compete in the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete in the table third-placed Suchsdorfer SV from 11 a.m. tomorrow in Kiel.
Despite five games still flawless record, the frontrunner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has maintained the sense of reality.
Team principal Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in a very similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good.”
The class and stability of the Suchsdorfer SV are mainly provided by imports from the far north.
"Their Danes and Finns can even refer to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
"This is going to be hard for us, as always.
You also need a good dose of luck.”
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His debut for blue-and-white could be Maxime Janvier.
If the currently active Frenchman in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga game, the Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liberec comes to his first use this season.
The hitherto undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be there in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also join the team again.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America Can Harm OMV
Donald Trump did not seem really happy when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening.
"In his haste to enact the law," Congress has packed a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming against the U.S. advance.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines to the EU.
Investors from the local OMV, which together with other European companies co-finance the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea management Nord Stream 2, have been correspondingly concerned.
The threatening backdrop is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are available to him.
"The press" has looked at which the company could fend off and which ones could really hurt him.
Narcos Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will take centre stage in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving their first trailer and showing off the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more state bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will be on 1. September begin.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the daycare lunch again itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city's daycare centers, the clock is turned back.
To the 1. In September, the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the municipal day-care facilities (Kitas) again on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the department of youth welfare, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking continues to be done: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled food.
The city operates 46 day-care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
In the past daycare year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"Meanwhile, not only children who are looked after 45 hours a week eat lunch in the day-care center," explains Pommeranz.
"The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2pm."
46 part-time workers have from the first. September Kitchen service: They heat the delivered food, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides the hourly scope.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the day-care team," says Pommeranz with satisfaction.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the daycare management to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that's also what it's all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
"The children should help to prepare the food."
The direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
“They have a well-known force in daycare, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the day-care rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has not only the quality improvement of the kitchen performance but also the charm that it has highlighted in the cost comparison between self-directing and third-party allocation for the city as the most economical, according to the press office.
And this, although 46 part-time workers are rehired.
"But these hours are not so important for around 750 people in the education area," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in the council elections in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will be held on 5. April instead.
The Taliban have released threats against an election trial that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will peacefully hand over power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are alleged to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to information from the police, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was with friends on Kolpingstraße, around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to make a phone call with the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but this failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men were later arrested by police.
Investigations are ongoing.
GMB concern over investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which manufactures Hobnobs and Rich Tea cookies alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years.
He added that staff and union representatives would be "the first to know" if their activities were to change.
In a letter to the company's store manager, GMB called on Scotland McVitie's to "consider that funding for modernisation of production lines will not be driven forward."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area, an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie."
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to this as we appreciate the continued commitment to staff and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross two months ago, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "Over the past few years, we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognize the legacy of Tollcross as a production facility. Should our operations at the site change, the employees and their union representatives will be the first to know this."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
The side of La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after handing over a bid of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record raid three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club are ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for 89 million pounds last season.
After the end, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week.
Barcelona are angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, although a source near the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we'll be in opposition to them, we'll contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, that will have consequences.”
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave in any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
In the night from Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately overturned a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused property damage of over 200 euros to the fairing of the vehicle.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car approached him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was driving his VW on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese at around 19:55.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car in his lane came to meet him, so that he had to swerve to the right.
The Touran driver touched the guardrail.
Property damage was caused to the car.
The driver of the oncoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued its journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle, to call Tel. 05761 / 92060 to contact the commissioner's office in Stolzenau.
Interview: "Domspatzen report exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases exonerates Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "Wir sind Kirche", declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope emeritus Benedict XVI.
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral sparrows, "two measures" are measured.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubted that they were "disgraceful and shameful acts" that had to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" was striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion to consider that normal," Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and this is a found food".
In addition, she pointed out that in her youth, "strokes had been a normal educational means" "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."
It would be unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memory volume "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the Diocese of Regensburg?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
The final report states on Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R..
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent.
Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, it is striking that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even connect positive memories with him despite violence."
In an interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen relieves Georg Ratzinger in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "incidents of violence on protective orders at the Regensburg Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a Domspatz did not bring a top performance musically.
As his biographer, how do you evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the whole 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger even occurs in it.
He is dedicated to just eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside its sphere of activity.
At best, he can be accused of learning about it too late or not having taken initial hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also give an excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted", "popular", "sincere", "competent" and "understanding", as an extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes of children".
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has sometimes led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only slammed with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed slaps and pulled too cheeky boys by the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
In order to save his honor, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers.
Do you know such methods of punishment?
Of course, I think each of us who was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivial.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his notoriety and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just threw themselves on him.
Many of the Bavarian Popes, who have never understood him, are still working hard.
But the truth is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, a lot has been reported in connection with the report on the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or co-scrutiny with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one person on behalf of the others, "It was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem with the investigation of sexual abuse was and still is that most of the victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even confide in parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger’s role in view of the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student interviewed put it this way: "With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) of all people would have had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it ... is also really absurd to assume that it is ... Boys have opened more forcefully or more clearly or rather than towards their parents, boarding school managers, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that pupils and/or their environment who were affected in advance were entrusted to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any co-knowledge.
So he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the attention of the complaint.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these obnoxious crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of "violence cesses" was to be read at the Regensburg Domspatzen.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "looking away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: This is the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the reporting to a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
But that is exactly what abuse of the report is.
There is a clean separate: between the preschool and the high school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, including from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.
All the terrible beating education, the cases in which boys were downright harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all occurred at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he did not see the boys until they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On which, as most witnesses point out, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but no sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in whom the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even connect positive memories with him".
So at most there is still the accusation of having looked away.
But despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which he was told about the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and of the events at a school where he just did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then only again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to him "that in preschool, the beating penalty will continue to be practiced."
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity when beating penalties were long prohibited in Bavaria.
Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
But you can't say he's always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "pitchwork of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past by today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abhorrent and also not for what was committed in preschool in terms of reciprocities and violence against innocent children's souls, this goes far beyond what was usual at that time.
This is all terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slapping and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the issue of beatings also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But even that must be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank from the previously more nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, who went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With biscuits and candy alone, you don’t turn unruly boys into great singers and face every success, no matter what the field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As a person you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: By working on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger quite well and experienced him again and again as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply believing and heartfelt person, of whom you cannot imagine that he could do even a fly a little offsee.
I regularly get involved, as many former cathedral sparrows still today, 23 years after his retirement, keep in touch with him, visit him, read him aloud - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day that he was once strict with them are clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral sparrows are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them close to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect person, to whom they still look up today and whom they worship.
And please, again quite clearly: everything that is accused of him are methods of education that were the order of the day at that time.
We can be glad we have overcome this time long ago.
But it's highly unfair, a man just because he's prominent and has an even more prominent brother, to make the media scapegoat.
There's all too obvious the evil intent behind it.
Because the report, which has just been published, exonerates him.
Now the decency would command, a 93-year-old man who has earned great merit and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably no one would know the Regensburg Domspatzen, finally to leave in peace.
