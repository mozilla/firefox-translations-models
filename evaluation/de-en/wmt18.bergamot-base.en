Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
An insanity where young people are supposed to meet today.
A crypt chapel, where is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Allotment gardeners cultivate the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who has had to get upset before knows this, because the Auto-Navi indicated a green meadow instead of a bypass road.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the geoportal Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but this is precisely why very revealing.
Especially when compared to current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury since the 19. Century changed.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that you do not recognize as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Administration, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria.
Your client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical reception of Bavaria - for military purposes, of course.
Even if the French troops with the peace of Lunéville of 9. February 1801 finally withdrew: It was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria map.
Elector Max IV Joseph continued to push the project forward, founded the "Topographische Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for Munich dates back to 1856 and, like everyone else, can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison earlier/today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a Munich district 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendling are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you see nothing but fields - at first glance: When zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces of land from the so-called "original recording", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer occupy farmers there today - but allotment gardeners of the "Land in Sonne" plant.
A large green area is emerging north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in the 19th. Century actually still a meadow - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the hill "Auf der Lüften" - but also in large letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstraße, people with delusions were once locked up.
In 1858/59, the Munich district insane institution "Auf der Auer Lüften" was founded.
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought into connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
“He was progressive for his time, for example, ending the chaining of the so-called lunatics.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has dealt with the institution for an exhibition.
There was initially room for 280 patients, later expanded to 500 places.
At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the district asylum in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost, one of the largest psychiatries in Germany, has been located there.
Young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum on the site of the former Auer Anstalt.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies.
West is the football field of the TSV München Ost, east residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural style to the original building of the insane asylum, which had been destroyed in bombing raids in the Second World War.
The Marienplatz was listed around 1856 as the "Haupt Platz", the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
The Allied bombs tore many holes in the city centre in December 1944.
A big one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small commercial buildings and a crypt chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where the preparatory work these days and on the 5th. April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn main line will take place.
With the slider, the old Munich map can be compared with today's aerial view - and the hole at the Marienhof can be filled.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Promotion of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.
“The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is up to the 28th. To take effect in August 2017, African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians urges to pay special attention when traveling through the state and exercise extreme caution, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents have recently occurred throughout the state and are noted here," the group's statement said.
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state's law enforcement agencies, which are disproportionately targeting minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that people happen.
They are stopped for their skin color, they are beaten up or killed," Missouri NAACP president Rod Chapel told the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints at such frequency that we have not heard before.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the US.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he was no longer gasoline while traveling through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being accused of a crime.
The council also points to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's office, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than whites.
"The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be ready, whether it's bringing bail money or letting the relatives know they're travelling through the state."
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th. rank of the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, interest groups have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the U.S.
Pasture fence project is elementary
The Fischerbach pasture fence project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have taken a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU local association met at the right-wing court of the Schwendemann family together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his business, where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, supplies 40 dairy cows and just as many young animals and accommodates holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest Milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, according to Schwendemann.
Only regional events come to the table of the holiday guests.
Since he is also chairman of Fischerbach's BLHV, he described the pasture fence project as "elementary important."
I cannot manage profitably on such steep areas.
The grassland area provides a lot of work, much had to be worked with the motor scythe.
"We are struggling with the conditions and with the topography here," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical crop protection and fertilizer, even if it did not run an organic farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the leader funding".
At a cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this would allow the reforestation of the areas to be pulled out for quite a while.
"The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and worry about how to get their farm going," the mayor stressed.
Farmers are often criticized because of the promotion
A total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 via the pasture fence funding.
The open-plan area is thus 40 hectares, which may not be reforested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded by Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers had 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac emphasized: "You do a really good job, without farmers and rural women it can't be done".
For Peter Weiß, it was also clear: "The best food is produced here".
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Care Directive (LPR) enables the state funding of pasture fences.
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.
The prerequisite is the presence of a support backdrop designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be traw-farmable (slope inclination above 35 percent) and must thus be threatened by afforestation.
The application for the Fischerbach pasture fence project 2018 is currently being submitted by eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence.
The open-plan area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Isn't there anything more sacred?
Now Trump's White House is taking on the Statue of Liberty
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.
The Americans appreciate these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN's Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drasticly restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To stay fair, Miller didn't attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had done it.
But he attacked their meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument.
When Miller insulted Acosta: "I don't want to go down here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world.
The poem you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history.
It is about the contemporary resonance to the upbeat words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your afflicted masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the miserable fall of your rich coasts."
There was never a time when the "miserable drop" was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump's USA.
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who campaigned to place their words at the grassroots after their deaths - knew very well that they were carrying out a highly political action.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The poem's connection with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing had long wanted to change this back.
The great screaming neck Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty did not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative who brings the American flame into the night-flood world: "Lady Liberty is going ahead.
It is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to enlighten the way to the United States."
Pretty unusually, Limbaugh has come across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted, wretched but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear.
And that, of course, isn't the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to illuminate the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team
UK athletics performance director Neil Black says the 16-strong Scottish contingent in the World Cup squad "will make a massive contribution to the team."
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is developing in Scotland" and the UK's athletics needs to learn something from it.
"We welcome it, and we're trying to understand it, and we'll keep it going until we find out," Black said.
'I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they've done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they did.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances, it's absolutely brilliant."
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle has been elected team captain by the team.
“Eilidh is quite modest.
Their captaincy speech was incredible," Black says.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great.”
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete at her fifth world championships at the 400m hurdles, says it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British squad.
Scotland's best total number of athletes so far at the World Cup was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
The middle-distance runner Muir leads this way and set five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scot to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first world championships when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
"What's special about being a team captain is because she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and voted for me makes it very special for me," she added.
“Obviously I’m very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they're here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on podiums.
As for my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she went well.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it's really important to rely on that home support and benefit from the fact that we're back at the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there."
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don't apply for public office if you can't tolerate the heating up of voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.
He scolded the criticism, for sure.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because in 1783 Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and silent, we are led to slaughter like the sheep."
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on being more like Washington.
Hogan's staff have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have voiced their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Well, and?" .
"It's just Facebook," a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly Democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second highest approval of the nation's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and playfully debut his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum called official and by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman, Amelia Chasse, defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who are swinging the whip online.
The Post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not trolls.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.
"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comment section of the news program "The Post."
“I also do not appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then they are disregarded by some as a so-called collective effort and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens.”
What the governor's staff described as a "concentrated spam attack," others would likely call "advocacy."
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message simply by blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It's much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing, that staff were dispatched to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials, or arrest and silence protesters.
But that’s what’s happening digitally right now.
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for berating Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the board of supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria when she banished a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be that hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers beat his lead.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
The people who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola," "Valerius," "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that put down Washington's decisions.
Petitions criticizing his stand on Amity's treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project's online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, disagreement and discourse are the foundation of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
The former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort in the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open hosted.
The Nordire, who led next door at the Archerfield Links to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and is acting as a tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club be built, and we see how it achieves its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
“The players will see this course at his best, he is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job when he set this place.
He is a zealous champion of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"That feels really special," said the Southport-based player.
“I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open as it was taken out of the programme the year after I had won it.
Coming back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year are coming back, and it's been special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate."
Gary Orr, the one after his 50. Birthday earlier this year came to the European Senior Tour, returns to the action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"It always means a little bit more when you're playing at home," said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how it went that far."
With the trio on the field, former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior major champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty are senior major champions.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Fewer lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of secondhand smoke.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) came to this conclusion in a study.
"According to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to secondhand smoke per year," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he used his own study on the subject from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new research is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
House connections turn out to be very complex
The construction work on Villinger Straße is in full swing and "lies reasonably in time," according to the head of the construction yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections, the situation is more complicated than suspected, since there is a lot hidden in the underground, which is not noted in the plans.
The traffic, which repeatedly hinders the construction work, poses a major problem for the construction team of the Stumpp company.
"The ignorance of motorists in front of red traffic lights and barrier grids is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the Stumpp company have been busy working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days were quite exhausting.
But fortunately, we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use a stove.
She rarely uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai reign in the troubled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as "nota" - directly in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed with eager, unwashed hands and devoured.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also carries out her daily work, e.g. B. Clothes with murky water to wash from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, no fields were assigned to her.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most village men are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are the soldiers here.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after 5pm," she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony taken in in 1969 after a disputed referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were supposed to vote by a public hand survey in front of the occupation forces.
An existing movement that rissed for independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government, which maintains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transportation.
The town of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and of corrugated iron roofs, which have been converted into different yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their trip here, let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Pago worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes as well.
"We weren't used to wearing these clothes," Degei says, pointing to her vibrant, hand-woven turban, her dark shirt and light skirt.
“We used to have only leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's gold country.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province the size of New Jersey with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has an estimated $78 billion worth of wood resources.
These riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papuas, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military preserves a suffocating presence.
A 2005 investigation into the New York Times reported that Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuas have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua's tribal highlands in the 1970's became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
"We Will Lose Everything," according to a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities from the previous year, such as unlawful executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular, according to another report - and the brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have intensified as Papua's resources bring an inflow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic trend is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese Warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are struggling to keep up here.
"The migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Papuas," explains Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
"It cost the native Papua - the mommy mom [the women] of Papua - their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and violations of the rights in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on their way to Jakarta's presidential palace.
But little has changed in Papua, and today locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point just two months after Jokowi's inauguration in October.
On the 7. December 2014, a group of 11 children were out and singing Christmas carols outside a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The terrified children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later came back with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking were hunting and beating the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papua men, women and children gathered at a football pitch outside the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance - running in circles and imitating a bird song - of Papua's Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began hurling rocks at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," according to an official document from TIME, which has not been released to local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the looming danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was listening in the mood.
"When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was crowded, a lot of shots were fired," he adds.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, told TIME in a bleak mood.
“I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him."
Papua Police Chief Inspector Yotje Mende told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings did not come to Jakarta 'filtered' until the following day.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathies for the families of the victims and vowed to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately, so it won't happen again in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he was setting up an out-of-court mechanism for resolving historic human rights violations.
But the excuses began almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90's and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through," he said.
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he did on the 5. June in Jakarta spoke to TIME and said he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "everything is regulated by law," he said.
Wiranto, whom the U.N. has charged with "crimes against humanity," which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's 1999 bloody independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights abuses had already been settled in Papua, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim incredulity.
"I've been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there hasn't been any progress whatsoever," Yohanes says.
“I’m tired.”
He says that years later he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
“I’m afraid of being arrested by the military, I’m afraid of being shot.”
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me," he says.
The shootings didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniai's Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to take an unconscious man to hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to hospital.
Excited villagers protested outside the company's site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.
"We were so panicking, we're afraid there will be revenge," says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the injured here being quickly admitted, according to TIME.
“I hid in my house for two days.”
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and to withdraw the mobile brigade of police from the area.
Paniai has always been a trouble spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the "Free Papua Movement" (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by toasting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily taken into custody in Paniai in recent years, under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty."
Some never show up again.
Among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as "a tragic, forgotten place."
Poverty boosts discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is just as out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can each work four or five fields of the sweet potato.
They retain the bulk of the crop for the family, while the rest are sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between native Papua and the new migrants, which have arrived in greater numbers since opening new flight routes to Nabire Airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and wealthier migrants.
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
"The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here," says John Gobai, the chairman of Paniai's tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
Moreover, restrictions on reporting international media remain tense.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch's deputy Asia director, the promises of Jokowi's election campaign to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report on Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa denial and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the U.N. Human Rights Council to investigate the "diverse and widespread violations" in Papua including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OMM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's allegations, telling journalists in Jakarta: "A democratic system still applies in Indonesia, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.
As an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on 4. May visited, locals broke their silence and afflicted him "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua say they probably won't vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shooting," says Gobai, the chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuas, view their voice for Jokowi as a "debt" he has to repay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai shooting victims carried out one last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and military station.
They know that they may never be entitled to justice, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family was killed," Yacobus says with his head lowered.
“What else can we do?”
Fires capture Dubai's 'torch' skyscraper for second time
A fire found its book on Friday in one of the world's tallest residential towers in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It's the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise building in just two years, which is randomly called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame.
“We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when the people screamed.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50. Floor to come down," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defence authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire at around 4.00am local time (00.00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter for those affected.
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, the exterior paneling for decoration or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of plates for insulation and disguise at London's Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that left some 80 people dead.
No Davis Cup reform: Continue best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has failed with his major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the proposal that Davis Cup singles only play on two winning sets for this sport was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
The five-set classics, which are often very long, but also very valued for this reason, are therefore preserved in the traditional competition.
63.54 percent of the member countries voted for the reform, so the goal of the ITF President David Haggerty was only narrowly missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member stations have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions," Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competitions.
After many objections, the proposal to hold the finale in a neutral place had not even come to the vote.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the following year in the first round.
To reduce the cost to the organizers, the requirements in terms of training pitches, etc. will be facilitated and the players will have to complete fewer official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. travelers put banned items on the plane, a survey finds out
A survey of air passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously smuggled prohibited items past the U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who entered the plane while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent claimed they had belatedly discovered that they had traveled erroneously with firearms, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disregard the rules.
Of those surveyed who admitted they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security checkpoint, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they intentionally put banned drugs on the plane.
The company said it had surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many had accidentally brought contraband through airport security and how many had done it on purpose.
It's no surprise that the people most likely to carry contraband - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were the ones flying most often.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it.
So it's no surprise that the largest amount of items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a time, people thought the TSA might look at books as contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn't care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Electric thousand-sas Elon Musk likes to give with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."
He has so far embezzled the fact that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed for the first time a different, less brilliant figure in the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: those of cancellations on the new mass market model 3.
Musk had frequently advertised the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car in recent months, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total of 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 US and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available, Musk acknowledged in a conference call with analysts.
However, the Tesla CEO does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in terms of demand, but on the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018 it should be - all models taken together - 500,000, 2020 a million.
The demand for it is obviously there.
According to Musk, 1800 reservations are currently added per day.
If you order a "Model 3" today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new, never-before-tested production lines without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are major delays, the non-bindingness of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws to reduce emissions because of delaying Obama-Era rules
A day after he was sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the lawsuit that had been brought against his previous post in a federal appeals court.
This is about a deadline that is on the 1. October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid "interfering in local decisions or obstructing economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's prosecutor before his appointment by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards was simply reinforcing the EPA's willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.
"Among previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in a settlement setting the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through legal proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the law and the authority that gives us seriously.”
Still, the EPA's opinion stated that Pruitt will eventually use his "power to delay and all other legally available powers of attorney" to ensure that the regulations are "based on a sound policy and the best available information."
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive rewrite of the ozone rules.
A bill approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to a vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week, said the group intended to maintain legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal -- after our lawsuits -- is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities," Schneiderman said.
New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, and the District of Columbia.
Soil-Ozone is created when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health and environmentalists representatives cheered on Pruitt's surprise change of course.
"It's disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible move from the person responsible for protecting the air we breathe," said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to fight against the Trump administration’s ideological crusade to be committed to polluters and their particular interests.”
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will take place on Sunday, 16. July, at 4:30 p.m. invited to a Serenade.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hilarius facility a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth benefit serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It's a unique village gem".
In 1267, St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg Book of Documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen with the vogue egg" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a stately court on the Tumlinger Berg, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not the other way around.
So people lived there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt of 1858, in addition to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which can still be seen today in the village of Tumlingen, the "mountain" was the third, the stately settlement core of the village.
Old maps from the period around the year 1600 underpin these historical conditions.
The patronage law arose from early medieval church law.
A gentleman who built a church, equipped it and occupied it with a pastor, remained the owner of this church and was also able to bequeath this church of his own.
Associated with this was the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The greater of the two shattered on Christmas 1673.
The newly purchased bell then sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the window panes were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the final resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Church of Hilarius was aborted.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year's night of 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was broken down.
Only the tower dwarf still existing today was preserved as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem from the "Schaffigen Pensioners" as successors to Dieter Dockhorn maintain the Hilarius facility.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite as organizers on Sunday, 16. July, the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery to St. Hilarius Chapel.
This is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The program will begin at 4:30 p.m.
Admission is from 15.30.
At the end of the Serenade, a drink will take place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade only takes place in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius system, which is important for Tumlingen and Hörschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen are particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organizer Walter Martini confirms.
Association wants approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore contacted the district council.
The association "Boisheim defends itself" has called on District Administrator Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was illegal.
The association argues that at the time of approval on the 30th. December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved, since at that time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed on the city border with Schwalmtal.
Within this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city.
Such zones are intended to prevent an "asparagus" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a few days earlier by a change of the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but this had not been approved by the district government of Düsseldorf, because of a formal error.
"Due to the lack of planning law requirements, the approval notice issued is still illegal and therefore also to take back," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim defends himself."
Current state of affairs: The city council has decided again before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; a permit from the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "This means that the granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded under planning law at this point."
The circle confirms the receipt of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been received by the district of Viersen since last week," a spokesman explained.
The circle takes them as an opportunity to re-examine the matter.
However, they are not expected to cause the proceedings to be stopped.
With regard to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim defends itself" on Thursday.
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, is planning to build four wind turbines each 200-metre-high on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded leases with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare site.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to around one fifth of the electricity demand of all Viersen households.
NEW Re plans to invest around €20 million.
Last summer, Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a stake in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and tractor crash together: Woman dies in horrific accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at around 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road remained closed for hours.
According to police, a 17-year-old young woman from Bornich drove her car with her 53-year-old mother as an accompanying person the L 333 in the direction of Bogel as part of the accompanied driving.
City and merchants plan 'home shopping' weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want the weekend on 8 and 9. Use September to attract residents to the city centre for shopping.
As the chairman of the business association, Christian König, announced, the "home shopping" weekend should sensitize the customers to what offers the own city offers offers offers offers away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional providers, similar to the weekly market, is planned.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center are to invite to "midnight shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearer region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian König.
The city administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city go into another stage of the project "Attractive Downtown".
These include new offers such as the first "Active Day" for the Brunnenfest, including Sundays open for sale, discussions with all tradespeople and hosts to persuade them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be new or re-tapped.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre while shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to help enliven the city center - up to landlords, the establishments of the whole city and clubs.
It would be necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy, which had partly spread, had said King in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that five Thuringian cities will participate for the first time in Germany's third "Heimat-Shoppen" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, Sömmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasize its importance for the common good of our cities more strongly," according to Streich.
The action led by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment with his or her own purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at US school
During construction work, a gas explosion occurred in the school building.
New other people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people have been killed and nine others injured, some of them severely.
According to the fire department, an injured person was still in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
One person died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
An initially missing person was also later recovered dead.
The dead were employees of the school.
As a cause of the accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas line.
During the holiday season, only a few people were in the building of the Minnehaha Academy.
Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of phone calls over payment of border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been released by The Washington Post.
On the 27. January urged Trump, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president berated him for publicly denouncing the wall. He reportedly said to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern U.S. border, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the U.S. to take over refugees who emigrated to Australia was "ridiculous," "lousy" and "stupid" and that insisting on the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a "dup" after he proposed a ban on relocation of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after telling Mr Turnbull, "that's the most unpleasant call for the whole day."
Moore's Ford massacre: Activists recite racist lynching as a call for justice
A 1948-man Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and rumbled towards the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men stepped out with guns to block his way.
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a pinstripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked scrutiny through the windscreen.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n ---- r Roger!" the man yelled.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screams tore the silence when a young black man was dragged from the passenger seat.
Thankfully, this terrible scene is that on the 22nd July was played, just one re-enactment.
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger," almost everyone in the audience uttered very real sighs.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have come back to Moore's Ford Bridge to mimic the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom, as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
"It's really inconceivable that in all these years, not a single person has been arrested - even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping with organizing the re-enactment.
“It’s a stain of dirt on a story, but it’s a burden on our souls.”
Brooks is a 71-year-old former congressman in the state of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist.
For him, the re-enactment serves as a dramatic call to action, and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want prosecution, we want cessation, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must receive justice," he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A medical examiner puts a bedcloth over the body of one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynch on the 27th. July 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by the NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynching trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have remained on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the dual motivation for the lynching actions throughout the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their vote for the first time in the summer primary campaign.
Around the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcom stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight - allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in the city had been that Hester had slept with Malcom's wife, Dorothy, and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On the 25th July 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcom from prison, according to the FBI.
He was escorted to prison by Dorothy and her cousins, Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But then, as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore's Ford Bridge, a lynch mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concludes.
“It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local prosecutions that was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and covered up the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
"It was a right to vote massacre," he said.
"You've all been killed to send a message to black people in this community: "If you register and if you vote, that's what's going to happen to you here."
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual re-enactment of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders.
Their representation is vivid, poignant and is based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exist in America.
It's hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynching because then we're confronted with its ugliness in all of us," she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest blacks - crowded into a room and listened as Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director here.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
"I feel dirty because I'm not like that," Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, rehearsed their lines.
The play begins with Malcom, who shouts at Hester and afflicts him, angry that he slept with his wife, Dorothy.
“I said, n——he, get out of my property!”
Rascona returns fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) breaks out into laughter.
Greene laughs the loudest.
"What?!" Rascona asked.
He's alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still giggling.
“I just don’t think white people said ‘n------- he’s.”
"Yes," joked one of the other black performers.
“You just have to hit the hard ‘R.’.”
And that's where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of companionship replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and forcefully.
Absolutely no one laughs.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, gunfire and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the actors' bodies and performs Billie Holiday's grieving eulogy, "Strange Fruit."
Your voice breaks at every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to watch the performance, many just coming down the road.
They have all experienced Georgia’s oppressive moisture for nearly eight hours as Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys.
Up to this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, if you are standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels spooky.
When the last notes of the song end, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the corpses.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mutters, as if to remember it.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe off their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in her arms, the emotional burden of the performance eventually breaking through with him.
"It's okay," one of the women whispers.
“We know that’s not in your heart.
You did this for a reason."
Later, the audience sits down with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta chats excitedly about the re-enactment with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words about the feeling the performance left behind.
"It's hard to hear these horrible words and actions ... from people who look like yourself and who do that because they look like you," she said.
"What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on," she added, "today this is just called police shooting."
In the same room, Tyrone Brooks holds court at his table, he eats and recalls civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
"The re-enactment is inspiring in a way, because it describes the horror of what we have endured, but it's also a moment of learning," he said.
“It’s like that if we don’t learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
Those who do not study their own history, who do not know their own history, are condemned to repeat it.
"Götterdämmerung" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful-frivolous production in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The revolving stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows either a shabby street corner with the remains of the wall and the kebab stall in Berlin, a "Plaste und Elaste" logo from the GDR period or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it, an open Mercedes classic car parked, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an Isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - that runs through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as they did in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces them Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), drag a body into the trunk in Hollywood manner and give the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the gloriously nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutally the scene when he slays Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience would like to thank the ensemble with strong applause.
Stormily celebrated are Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who is modest and bows his hands to the Merkel robus.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - again in view of the great heat in casual leisure clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
If he had had to end a shouting whistling concert in 2013, there was great cheer five years later, in which the isolated "Buh" calls went down.
Festival director Katharina Wagner must have been happy about it.
"You can tell that the audience has grown together with the "Ring" in a way," she had said shortly before the performance of the dpa.
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it has also grown an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several places in their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
And I also worked at the school in the open day.
What is your experience with it?
Quantity: It's a beautiful, broad spectrum that I see here.
I have to deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-vocation volunteer.
How's that coming?
Quantity: I did high school.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully canceled.
I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is a glimpse, you can see how it is on the ground, in the focal point maybe.
And was that so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
I will start my studies in the social sector in the winter semester.
I will study dual, probably do a social worker training in the Herne Youth Welfare Office and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.
Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the voluntary service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you do your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
It was very varied with me.
I was also partially in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was just the thing that attracted me.
I could see my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Different from civil engineering studies?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of their heads, who each have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee, whether a young person who has been taken out of the family - you always have to go into it individually.
Very interesting.
And you weren't afraid to touch?
Quantity: I'm not the type for that.
It's an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, a lot of kindness.
There are sometimes negative moments, but that’s just how life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividend to revive business
UK education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as another restructuring programme was launched to overcome the pressure the company faced.
The job cuts, which Director General John Fallon announced predominantly for the end of 2018 and early 2019, are coming in addition to his previous restructuring, which saw 4,000 jobs already lost.
Pearson announced a further £300m ($394 million) plan in a third cost-cutting program in May to revive a business hit by the quick step toward digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after achieving an increase of 1 per cent to £2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul's convoy attack: Nato soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber has attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killed one soldier of NATO and injured several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a statement from NATO said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence that has hit Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday, more than 30 people were killed at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
A statement from NATO said the explosion on Thursday night happened when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by an "impromptu explosive device carried by people."
The statement says all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at the Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, of which about 20% were in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out this attack.
On the 31. May killed a massive bombing in the center of the city more than 150 people with the country's deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and, in particular, the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay Obama's government's regulation that states are required to curb smog-causing emissions. This came a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to push ahead with the so-called "Ozone provisions 2015," saying it showed the agency's commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief executive Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA's intention to delay the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to adhere to stricter air quality standards - by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the district of Colombia, filed suit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations that former President Barack Obama has imposed as part of a broader agenda designed to boost economic growth, according to Trump.
However, the effort has sparked the setback of Democrats and conservation groups worrying about the impact of larger emissions on public health.
The EPA's website says inhaling air that contains ozone "can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms" such as asthma.
Municipal Council wants community space
In the end, the decision was clear: With two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Winzeln decides to set up a common room in the future senior housing complex.
Before the discussion, there is an important information: The purchase contract for the still missing part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take time for the area previously belonging to the church community to be in the parish, there is now no longer any planning obstacle for the project to be managed by a private investor.
There is a discussion about a common room for this.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor, he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a common space not as a meeting place only for the residents of the elderly-friendly housing, but openly into the community.
As an example, the word "knitted cafe" made the rounds.
The decision, which was already decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, is sweetened by funding opportunities.
The construction is in the renovation area.
The establishment of a common room would be eligible, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent.
In order to signal to the investor that he does not want to be thrown sticks between his legs in this respect, the proposal foresees the finding that both saddle - which is based on the surrounding development - and the roof of the lectern - which reduces the eaves height and makes construction more economical - would be possible.
Unnecessary, so says not only Wilfried Sohmer, is this addition.
If it helps, he'll pass the panel unanimously.
It's not that easy with the common room.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings, with which you can not really progress, but you now lean out of the window at the common room, she says: "I have a hard time with it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation.
It sees behind it a covert subsidy to already wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the land you do not give a subsidy, but get a real, in case of doubt marketable value, is the counter-talk.
Staiger's request to split the proposal for a decision accordingly finds three supporters.
So it remains with two votes against in the original program, which Stefan Haller summarizes thus: "If we take the decision this way, we take a giant step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclist is hurled on road
While crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist was caught by a car in Garath on Wednesday and seriously injured.
As the police announced, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been at 12.20 clock with his bicycle on the bike path of the road the road Schwarzer Weg from Hilden coming.
The senior wanted to cross the roadway at the level of the Am Buchholzer Busch road.
A passenger car driver driving in the same direction granted him priority.
When the Langenfelder drove onto the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the oncoming traffic.
He collided with a car driving a 66-year-old Hilden woman.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a rescue truck.
FC Bayern Munich must do without David Alaba and Thiago in the Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba must let the game against Dortmund snub.
With personnel worries, FC Bayern travels to Dortmund for the first competitive match of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Super Cup against the cup winner.
Personnel worries at German football record champions Bayern Munich are getting bigger and bigger ahead of Saturday's Super Cup (20.30/ZDF and Eurosport) at cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti must also do without David Alaba in a duel with BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
In addition, the Munich team is missing Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team's game.
"We know we're not in the best physical condition," Ancelotti said, adding: "The most important point is balance in the team.
It wasn’t good last.”
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official competitive match of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently," said Ancelotti, who expects a "difficult, intense game."
The duel between the two German football heavyweights captivates the fans.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Wandering in the resin from star to star
In the Harz, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003.
A "starry path" meets the information needs of many visitors to the Harz, it said.
It combines nature, science, exercise and athletic performance.
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association is planning "easy-to-reach installations at five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
In question would be St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiss and Sieber.
The information on the boards is to be supplemented via the Internet.
This is why a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations.
Accessibility is also a criterion.
Later, the star trail will be extended by train.
"On the star trail, viewers learn a lot of interesting facts about the physics of the individual stars, for example, about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star shines more strongly than another, although it is much further away.
It is also communicated in which constellation a selected star is located and when it is best seen.
The association has been operating in the mountain town of St. since 2014. Andreasberg the highest observatory in northern Germany.
The location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
Often, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy can be clearly seen with the naked eye.
In the university city, on the initiative of the Förderverein Planetarium Göttingen, there has been something similar to the planned Sternwerg - the Planetary Trail since 2003.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the Planetary Path leads with its steles up to the Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (municipality of Gleichen) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets - including Pluto at the end point, degraded to the dwarf planet - are set up exactly at a distance and scale of one to two billion.
The earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, which is exactly 75 meters away, measures 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is a good four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with Pluto.
So pedestrians are faster than the light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future below £147, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hallway to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super-featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision on former four-divisional world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five Pound-for Pound list.
Garcia stretched out her right hand and said, "How are you, champion?
I wish you good luck.”
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7pm on ESPN.
As the pair posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude."
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia reminded.
“I’ve risen to 140 pounds for Broner, but I’m not that tall.
I'm small for 140.
I want to come down to lightweight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans demand.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked if it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko will have to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to schedule a date with Garcia next summer (37-0, 30 knockouts) who is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight at the Forum on 23. September has.
"This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans asked about it," Garcia said, and later openly expressed pressure on fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other names can generate that kind of attention.
Whenever they are ready ... "
Garcia said he valued Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter," and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thought the three-fight champion from Riverside look "very slow, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was to show punching strength, then boxing.
Both said they could feel the momentum that was building up for their own struggle.
“This is the struggle that needs to be carried out.
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm.
I'm more than happy to work on it," Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I've been waiting for the top fighters, and this is Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre burst
In an accident on the A7, four people were partially seriously injured on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 16.30 shortly before the Marktbreit junction, probably after a tyre burst.
The car hurled to the right into the embankment, where it rolled over and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the initial care of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was closed to the north for about an hour, then the traffic on the left lane could be routed past the accident site.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Tripartite chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2:2 at the season opener against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive formation brings points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first game of the season, and the result had it not been for the two goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals against too much, and we have to be even better at Aue," says the Fortuna Düsseldorf defender.
In the Erzgebirge, the triple chain is to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free-kick, the Fortunes don't want to catch themselves either.
“For the future, it will be the case that no one puts themselves on the line alongside Michael (Rensing) anymore.”
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can cope better than with the chain of four, even after the experience in the preparation with the chain of three.
"I don't know how we're going to act in Aue yet," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause "because we have players who can build well," said Hoffmann.
"Prerequisite is, but that we harmonize even better and we don't afford so many play-off mistakes in the build-up."
Of course, Hoffmann is also going to Aue to win the game.
“But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw, does not know.
The performance could be okay," said Hoffmann.
“But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a decent season opener.”
His coach didn't want to know about that.
"I only judge the start of the season after six to eight match days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue, just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can start the season with a home game," Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a little fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favorite in the bones.
"But they don't know that 100 percent where they currently stand," says the centre-back of the Fortuna.
Although the guests from the Rhineland go as a slight favorite on Sunday in the encounter in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"That we're sweeping them away just because we have the claim to get in the top six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive in just one defeat against Aue from nine games.
“There is no team in the 2. Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the outset," explains Fortuna's head coach.
“To make such a statement would be arrogant and overbearing.”
And so Funkel doesn't want to experience his players on Sunday in any way.
New results of Swedish asylum-age assessment tests published
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, who have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (Rättsmedinalverket) has begun conducting the tests last year.
They are to make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent out 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency now has the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to the 31st. July 2017 published.
Eighty percent (2002) were judged to be 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person is "possibly under the age of 18."
The tests are only carried out in cases where the person's age is questioned.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
"We don't see much difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that "propose that the person under investigation is 18 years of age or older."
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly said that she was turning 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
One skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the type of measurement should be used.
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't say it for sure, we shouldn't pretend we could," he told the Metro newspaper.
However, Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general, you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in which case that's about 10 percent."
Full in the plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete part was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance to Lauterbach.
"We are very good at the time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Roads and Transport Department at the Freiburg Government Bureau.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges in need of renovation between Schramberg and Lauterbach.
The end of construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the schedule is adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red colored sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three structures are now thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are built of red colored sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve and 10.60 meters long, respectively.
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30-metre-wide and seven-ton so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning.
This is an edge fastening that is also used as an operating path.
A 2.20-metre-wide bridge cap is to be deployed on the southern part of the bridge on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run.
The special thing about it is that these are precast parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach has required a special sensitivity.
This is where a fiber optic cable runs, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by handouts.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished off first.
For the bridges between the building and the collective pond in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated in one lane by a traffic light.
For the construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach, the road in the area of the bridge at the level of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed.
The cost of the three bridge renovations is a total of 700 000 euros.
The whole thing is financed by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Colorful protest at German potato salad
It is not so common for parties to pull together, but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany (AfD), what is otherwise difficult to reconcile comes together.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that peacefully shows flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "big campaign kick-off".
And brings well-known names to the start - like Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland the top duo for the federal election on 24. September forms, and Deputy Federal Chairwoman Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners, but to demonstrate.
The motto "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally, the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at one table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the roundabout - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle.
A colorful picture that offers itself there.
And what is rightly looking forward to Christa Karoli, chairwoman of the Forums Eine Welt and one of the authoritative organizers: "Great how many people have come together here".
There is music and plenty of food, including a "primordial German potato salad, which even the AfD could easily eat," says the woman who brought him with her.
The police have ordered many officers to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters away from the venues.
How did the AfD actually come up with Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes of the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has tried to such an event and got the contract.
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun, but got a rejection there, because because of the already built-up Laurentiuskirmes, there was not enough parking.
So now the roundel, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a beautiful event here".
Looking at the event on the roundabout forecourt, he says: "That's the good right of the people, the main thing, it remains peaceful".
It also does: Around 8 p.m., a band provides entertainment on the roundabout, various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy federal chairwoman Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence remains unchanged, but so far the officers had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests on the forecourt have a longer breath, but also there is just after 9pm clean up.
The police can back off - no special incidents.
Trombone hits trumpet
A rehearing with the Wolfach trombonist Frederic Belli will be available in the series Haslach monastery concerts tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the monastery church.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or even "Balkanfolklore" meets a classical German education with roots in brass music.
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is a solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo tromboonist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire not only to push the boundaries on their instruments, but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres.
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new guise, Daniel Schnyder's "World Music" combines with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by the jazz echo award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play mix into a fascinating overall work of art.
This core part of the program was only premiered this spring with huge success in Freiburg.
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and even more: The Haslach monastery church with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives.
But I want to try everything," said Kristen Stewart openly about her bisexuality.
“When I bite into grilled cheese once, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’”
Arguably the Hollywood star's best-known relationship was that of her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, which ultimately went bitter apart.
Despite all this, the brunette performer assures Harper's Bazaar magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I played it?”
After her split, Kristen admitted she was bisexual: "I've always lived and seriously believed in dualism.
So it has never confused or hindered me.
I just never liked not being taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz" she suffered from this in school, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
This really hurt me a lot.
When I was eleven, the kids told me I'd look like a boy.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think to myself, 'girl, be proud of yourself!'"
Especially to the public, she doesn't like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some describe me as ungrateful, but I don't like having to justify myself to the whole public."
Western Virginia Governor announces he's changing party
. West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he would change sides.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have moved away from me," Governor Justice said.
“Today I will tell you with a lot of prayers and a lot of thought ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia, I can’t help you anymore if I am a Democratic governor.”
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow, I will change my registration with the Republicans," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play a different game.”
Mr. Trump previously promised a major announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016, according to Forbes.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It's worth about $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying: "The change of party from Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us rather than work on making our country great again."
"With only 15 governorates and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, Governor Justice's announcement is only the last rejection of a party that is without leadership from top to bottom and unable to find a positive, unifying message," RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel told CBS News in a statement.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
The global head of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the moment for the country to be welcomed back into the sport.
Russia's athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country's banishment from the sport was accurate and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he felt sorry for "all the athletes who have been snatched away from gold and silver medals at competitions."
Despite its comments, the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which was imposed in November 2015, after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force's recommendations that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia," Coe said.
“We have to do everything we can in the next few months to normalise this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the depraved system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to the strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF task force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still needed to meet some of the criteria for reinstatement.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still free to operate, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
Funeral act for soldiers crashed in Mali
At a funeral service in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, around 1000 people of the two soldiers who died in a helicopter crash in Mali commemorated.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precautions.
Defense Minister Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the still unexplained cause of the crash.
However, she described the two perished pilots as "proness of their field."
"We bow to this supreme sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she explained.
The 33-year-old major and the 47-year-old chief of staff from northern Hesse had died in West African Mali on Wednesday a week ago.
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlar Cathedral of St. Peter on Thursday accompanied by a Bundeswehr wake.
At noon, only the relatives in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral service began in the circle of family, closest friends, representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics.
Among them were Hesse’s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the inspector general of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
Grief guests laid down roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the perished soldiers as "highly decorated" and operationally experienced.
The chief of staff had helped build up the flight operation of the Tiger attack helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this occupation could not avert the crash, then no one would have been able to."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubts about the UN mission in Mali: the operation was dangerous.
But he is also of high importance "for a country from which we are only separated by two states," she said.
After the funeral service, the coffins were brought out of the cathedral.
When and where they will be buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was announced by the royal family on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde.
The sculptor Bjørn Nørgaard has already made a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband's decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is still unclear.
But he had no intention of being buried in his French homeland.
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession to the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also drops the title "Prince's Consort".
Since Henrik did not get the title and function in Denmark, he did not consider himself to be equal to his wife - even after death, explained Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal family.
Where the 83-year-old's final resting place will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he had no intention of being buried in his French homeland, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he has worked for for the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
During his later wife, the sympathy of the people always flew, Prince Henrik had a difficult stand in his almost 50-year reign with the Danes.
In an autobiography, Henrik commented on the first few years in Denmark: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitting socks, Citroën instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation in this country for being the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for forbearance.
I was different.
I seemed happy with that position and not being ashamed.
Those were two mistakes!”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick new election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick new election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Weil spoke out in favour of the dissolution of Parliament on Friday.
Earlier, the surprise exit of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the state election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition of the CDU and FDP.
The previous Green MP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (Wümme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she declared in Hanover on Friday.
CDU parliamentary leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to take them in.
The CDU and the FDP would have a combined 69 seats in the Lower Saxony state parliament, the SPD and the Greens, 68 seats.
So far, the ratio has been the other way around.
The new state parliament will be regular on 14. elected January next year.
Thümler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it could continue to govern in this situation without a majority.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the state parliament decides as quickly as possible its self-dissolution.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the state parliament will withdraw the confidence of the prime minister and elect a successor.
“Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities need to be examined legally clean," Thümler said.
“One will calmly discuss all questions if they are legally reasonably examined.”
Thümler called Twesten's move "but somewhat curious."
The politician herself stressed: "I'm not a traitor.
I feel very good.”
She described herself as a supporter of black-and-green.
The Greens called on the breakaway MP to return their state parliament mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her state parliament mandate, which she has received via the green state list, with immediate effect," state chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner said in a statement.
The leader of the Greens Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of Elke Twesten extremely".
She had deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group.
“Even against the background that there were no differences in content, we cannot understand this step.”
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the conversion of the Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a betrayal.
"The behavior of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of red-green," the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to allow the state parliament to quickly re-elect.
The exit of Twest costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
"In her hurt vanity and in her frustration, the politician puts her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
“It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to make political capital out of it.”
Lower Saxony's CDU parliamentary leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his MPs to include Elke Twesten in the CDU.
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 state election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD at the time, but the SPD and the Greens had a wafer-thin majority of one vote in the state parliament.
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison eggs, Mr Schmidt?
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs.
How did the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) and answer.
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp imprint.
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmittelwarn.de, the federal states provide the latest information on the affected egg batches.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take over the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the reconnaissance officer is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food monitoring is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has immediately switched up and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the concern of Germany became known.
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe for health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005mg/kg is exceeded for eggs, they are not marketable.
However, unpolluted eggs can be sold and consumed.
This time, it's not the businesses' fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production companies are not directly at fault.
Rather, they have to expect economic damage due to alleged illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are too few inspectors in an emergency.
Is there only a lack of staff or the conclusive responsibility?
It was precisely the official controls that uncovered the process.
However, the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
This is precisely why a consistent investigation of such events and the handover to the public prosecutor’s offices are of decisive importance in cases where criminal offences can occur.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to provide complete information.
Is regular alertness in the event of food scandals really necessary?
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transportable food.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Through the panned remedy, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have fallen into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the unlawful use of the insecticide Fipronil in the husbandry of food-supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all competent authorities to clarify the facts quickly and completely.
How football's financial rules affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar's world record transfer from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris-Saint Germain.
Any consequences will yet come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the governing organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without major losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG can almost certainly loosen up the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team's energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on acquiring players, but must counteract with legitimate sources of income that allow them to take the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on enormous debt in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked themselves ruining themselves if banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the clubs' debts to monitoring their losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the squad and build a global brand - should become a tougher affair.
During the current three-year FFP assessment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of 30 million euros.
And although Platini fell out of favour from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to campaign to deter excessive spending.
"Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future," Andrea Traverso, who is in charge of FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid Neymar's buy-out clause in a lump sum, it may distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the transfer fee for the next five years of EUR 44.4 million can be reported in the financial statements.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time $82 million), which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outsmart their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of sponsorship of the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come in via payments from the 2022 World Cup's organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassador and such a maneuver could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to heed any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar's transfer, said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be released.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The club expects revenue to increase by at least 30 per cent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go, and it tried to prevent Neymar's departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial doping" with the club and the state," La Liga's president, Javier Tebas, told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's reservations against a state that funds a club.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said Thursday.
“Once a country owns a club, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new supplier of chocolate
In recent years, Chocolat has produced Frey on-board chocolate for Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to end: the airline is re-writing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed at the request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red-and-white wrapped chocolate tablets at 14 grams distribute the flight attendants to the passengers per year before landing.
Swiss did not want to give any information about the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwestern Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion francs.
But the advertising effect is always more important: For a Schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants there are in the new call for proposals.
However, only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to seek a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Swiss has been distributing chocolate panels on board its flights since 2006.
Before Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
Swiss introduced the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are spoiled with treats from the Confiserie Sprüngli, in business class, passengers snack on Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey also distributes on the short-haul route, both in business and economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympic champion Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup elimination and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters wide, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year grunge era (as the thought leaders David Wain and Michael Showalter shot the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things.
As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is running out.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables that of H. Jon Benjamin was spoken).
By stiffening themselves to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who grow up - they nevertheless managed the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with his adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the watering can principle, including a riff on the stalker films of the 90's like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle."
At one point, a character browses through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The Amiable Coop (Mr. Showalter, now novelist, has still not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.
And there's another crazy-vicious plot into which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, which is now by George H. W. Bush (a well-made impression of Michael Ian Black) is supported.
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It's especially fun, the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon's lower lip beard from "Singles," whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It's the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like some sort of repetitive "Seven Up!" Series until he achieves what I take as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose final scene will show the gang how she will attend the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon, meanwhile, is reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-To-West Ringfight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, starring Rhys Thomas as director, claims to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The lead roles - a hard-boiled Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are dubbed by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloë Sevigny - makes for a decent game 'Find out the voice'.
But "Comrade Detective" is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single one.
With six long episodes, it drags on, and the comedy isn't fast or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective," who has been redacted to a smaller length, could better deliver his agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything the food for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with its own.
Strike against drug mafia in the country
The police have succeeded in striking a blow to the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the public prosecutor’s office in Konstanz announced on Friday.
15 accused between the ages of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants were issued against them.
In addition, the officials ensured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in simultaneous raids in Italy.
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects Italians.
The two are therefore probably extradited to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
The members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor’s office in Konstanz has been investigating the organized drug trade in southern Germany.
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor’s offices in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The investigations were mainly targeted by Italian nationals with close references to the Italian Mafia.
Also an incident on the 27. May in Hüfingen, where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning, is likely to go to the gang's account.
Weise laments big gaps in foreigners' register
"Data from citizens who should not appear": According to a report, the Foreigners Register in Germany has considerable deficiencies.
This leads to sometimes serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, the Federal Government Commissioner for the Refugee Management Officer, Frank-Jürgen Weise, drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register of Foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "some serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, Weise warned in an analysis available to the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
The register shows ten million people with foreign nationality, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 immigration authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good until now.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, “from people who are no longer alive, or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore.”
"Faulty data input can significantly slow down return processes," the report continued.
The statistics on people subject to departure also include EU citizens who do not have to leave the country.
However, such false assignments led "to a distorted debate about the handling of those obliged to leave," according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16-year-old children when they have entered from there.
This is according to an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the “Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung”.
The paper states that the BAMF carries such procedures "in relation to families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since the 1. June 2017 through again."
Since the end of 2014, this was practically no longer possible, according to the newspaper, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, the EU state is responsible for refugees, which they first reach.
If a migrant travels on to another EU country, that state can send it back to the country of entry.
The Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
The domestic spokeswoman of the left faction in the Bundestag, Ulla Jelpke, criticized this decision: "Families with children threaten because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system illegal reception conditions and a threat to the best interests of the child".
Second best result achieved
The blood donation service has already provided a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach for other people.
At least of the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
Especially Jürgen Greule, who now shared 50 liters of blood with his now 100 donations.
Traditionally, the municipality pays tribute at the meeting of the municipal council to the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It is brilliant how our body is designed for this purpose and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood to strangers, and we also pay unselfishness to the donors," underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained the district readiness manager of the German Red Cross (DRC), Holger Maisenbacher, because the preserves are decomposed into their components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in the spring in Oberreichenbach.
"This year, we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRC district readiness manager.
Obviously, the change to the Theaterhaus just a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Even before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Schöck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger record half as many, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter each gave ten times 500 milliliters of their life juice.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" as it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of intensifying pressure.
The bank's policymakers from the Bank's Monetary Committee (MPC) voted by 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25%, with fewer members seeking a rise this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the autumn.
But she signalled that interest rate hikes would become necessary over the next few years to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw a portion of the mammoth economic package issued a year ago after Brexit.
She will demand time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide £15bn more under this system - with £115bn of sterling.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the MPC's central forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as pressure on households' real incomes continues to weigh on consumption."
At interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would be made "gradually" and "limited."
The Bank's downwardly revised growth forecasts for this year and next are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell after this news against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31, falling 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to make no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for a rate hike and GDP rose to 0.3% in the second quarter from 0.2% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the bank towards the end of the year.
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor pay rises, as tightening first gets even worse before it will then improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income slump over the next few years, but she added that wages will "significantly" recover at the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after cutting interest rates to 0.25% last August after the shocking EU vote, which caused the pound's fall.
The bank estimates that it is likely to take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Ahead of the bank's final ruling on interest rates, the call for a rate hike had risen as inflation boosted pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers calling for a 0.5% rise in July.
Inflation has fallen to 2.6% in June last month from 2.9%, although the bank said that this was expected and it will pick up again in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot relative to its 2% target was "quite" attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders look loudly for business and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals expire and close the new mortgages, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular."
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in the High Court against funding the drug at the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) taken before intercourse, which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through an initial three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal last year upheld a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP despite claiming local authorities should fund it.
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention," while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described this as a "crucial moment."
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to sign up, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be launched across England in April 2018.
Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in people at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough medications in a person's body to prevent HIV infection.
Such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also sign up for possible participation at their local participating sex clinic.
The program will be £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the drugs this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: "This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three-decade progress made in addressing one of humanity's greatest health challenges."
Deborah Gold, chief executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is a pivotal moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner, resulting in the improvement of many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who is at risk for HIV will be left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are well on our way to protecting more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, shadow health minister, said: "The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is conducted as soon as possible across the country to protect individuals who are HIV-infected, and that it will help us get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society.
Living the big life: Mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrinked from a major home in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It's on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne didn't pack and sell her bags.
"Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
“I wanted high ceilings, big windows, a lot of light.
That was my requirement," she says.
To this end, she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5-foot-high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which to stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.
"The steelworks are quite complicated," he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it’s about building the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full on top of each other - with much extra drama.
For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.
At both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne.
By perceiving a more glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when not in use.
Foldable kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
“It’s counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m2, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, you'll sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," Erfan says.
“In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on soil size.”
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
"The materials are the things that touch you and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that an apartment can transform from something standard into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you might choose not to leave these.
Brothers fight over a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute over one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
The former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul. He took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.
Paul has wanted to retire from the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a shop on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It sold in 1999 for $85 million.
This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis' portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
After an agreement with her late father, Colin - described by Paul as "the main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul about a third.
A court record states that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul worth $176 million.
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
"The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects," he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first Supreme Court hearing was held.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
"My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
Costs are rising in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicacy businesses from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family's first denim store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was "in my final years of high school, when Paul was still a young child (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property amicably to their sons.
"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million when leaving the company and Luke $26 million.
Both Lukas and Mark have become, says Paul, "become bitter about the terms of their financial separation."
Colin has held back a lot, despite being a former AFL board member and, after a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the television star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin replied via text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was before the courts.
"It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother's demands.
"Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a solution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to restrict the president's media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly actually do.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - in hopes of keeping the boss on a more even course.
Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
"As John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior staff on his first day at work, he posed a major issue in President Donald Trump's White House that he wanted to fix: bad information that comes into the hands of the president.
Kelly told staff that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he were to get good information."
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his television commercial is still strong.
"If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was profusive to show him that he received fair coverage from places to convince," former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico's Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keeping Trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves steady praise."
Okay.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we others don't know - that Trump's tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him a few times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has consistently been able to prevent Trump from evoking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties keep trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that potentially promotes their views of the world.
Politico - wholly engaged in this story - reported in May on the advisers' preference to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he is stiffending to find out where these came from.
This is exactly what happened in late February when someone maliciously maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, gave, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being "the source behind a bunch of leaks" at the White House.
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or that he did not offer any concrete evidence or that he has made false allegations in the past and revoked them.
Trump read the article and started questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-chief of staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives."
How did that work?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly's mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending out (virtual) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run this summer.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are naturally not known, clues from the population are hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday of the action, which follows the "EU Most Wanted" Advent calendar from winter.
Experience has shown that many fugitives are hiding at holiday destinations, Europol said.
They have put together 21 postcards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted, more than 2.5 million times it has been viewed.
36 of the online wanted could be arrested so far, at least eleven of them on the basis of information after publication on the website.
Travellers negotiate over a trench and return to the 'millionaire's series'
Some of the West Midlands' wealthiest homeowners are once again on a war footing with some determined travelers who have negotiated a moat drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull, which is called the "millionaires" franchise.
They have brought horses, babies and an army of vans after they were only kicked out in May, but without being deterred by a ditch unearthed by the council to prevent their incursions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defences and pushed their vehicles through a section that went unhindered to find a way.
Angry residents have afflicted the advice of Solihull, who said it was "useless to deal with the issue."
An anonymous resident said: "They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travellers were there in May, continued to be moved and are now back.
More arrived last night, probably even more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the council can't even stop that."
A resident who did not want to be named said: "It's ridiculous, we've only just seen the last round of these travellers, only to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area."
A spokeswoman for the council of Solihull said: "We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihulls police. We are taking the necessary legal action so that they move on as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case."
Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof becomes the Waldhotel Luise.
The house at the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and is scheduled to take place on the 1. will reopen in March next year.
This is good news for the city.
Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH to the 13th. In April 2014, around 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenues from the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the district, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by drawing up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not uncontroversial at the time in the local council.
But especially Freudenstadt’s Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties in the house at that time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a three-star-plus category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadter Objekt.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
They are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," Thomas Scherer says in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should later become "beautifully close to the citizen", as Thomas Scherer expresses himself.
“We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it.”
The facilities include a swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room.
You do not want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an upscale downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to be broad, explains Scherer further.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He had already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are congruent with those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly.
Just under a million euros, he reckons.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In a courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia affair: U.S. special investigator sets up grand jury
In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called grand jury, according to a report.
The panel has begun work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote, citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper viewed the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.
The broadcaster CNN reported that there were already initial subpoenas by the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump's eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of specifically interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between Trump's campaign team and Moscow.
The focus of the investigation is to be several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.
Mueller also reportedly took a closer look at Trump's private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel had personally put Trump at the center and investigated the accusation of whether the president may have obstructed the judiciary in the wake of the affair.
The primary task of grand juries is to examine existing evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are therefore also called indictment chambers.
Most of the time, they are switched on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The procedure is always done behind closed doors.
The panel can also be called in by the public prosecutor to subpoena people for questioning under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
They should also provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, as well as his then campaign chief Paul Manafort, were also present at the conversation.
Legal experts said on U.S. television on Thursday evening that the setting up shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
However, it does not necessarily mean that the grand jury will be involved in the end to decide on the filing of an indictment.
Nevertheless, the creation of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign by his political opponents.
"The Russia story is a total invention," Trump said.
The issue gives Democrats a way to feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.
His special adviser, Ty Cobb, said in a statement that he knew nothing of the appointment of a grand jury.
But it also usually works in secret, he emphasized.
The White House favors any action that accelerated the special counsel's work in a "fair" way.
Former FBI Director James Comey has said three times that the president is not under investigation.
There is no reason to believe that anything has changed, the statement said.
Mueller, however, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this expulsion, allegations against Trump had become loud, he had wanted to obstruct the judiciary.
Comey testified before a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop the investigation against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his associates.
That sparked speculation about whether Trump wanted to fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel, such as in the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the urging of the president by the Justice Department.
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented bills on Thursday that the special counsel could no longer be so easily fired.
Antarctica: Giant iceberg drifts in Antarctica
In West Antarctica, a gigantic iceberg of Berlin’s almost seven times the size of Berlin has detached itself from the ice shelf.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs more than one trillion tons and is 5800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two or three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice repels in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken-off colossus was previously a part of the Larsen C ice shelves.
Ice shelf swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.
It therefore grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C ice shelf is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.
North of this ice shelf, the balance of waxes and breaking off was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete ice shelf has disintegrated there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is some evidence that the Larsen C ice shelf is also in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is at present.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can decay if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of ice shelf and iceberg does not raise sea levels, as they float on the water and displace ice as much water as it results after melting itself.
However, the loss of the ice shelf means that the glaciers flow directly into the sea and can drain much faster than before.
This could possibly raise the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
The Larsen-C-shelf is the fourth largest ice shelf in Antarctica, with almost 50 000 square kilometers, according to AWI.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks down regularly.
"Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more vulnerable position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University.
"This is the widest withdrawal since records began," he also confirmed.
Scientists are debatable whether the Larsen C ice shelf will now grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding: "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not trace the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have decayed in recent decades.
This long corner of Antarctica stretches towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula's ice area has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperature rises the fastest.
CDU wants house tariff on staff
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is calling for leaving the employers' association to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the district day waved through 41 new jobs in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now another 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The apprenticeships at the circle are apparently highly sought after.
Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel in order to be able to cope with the increased requirements and tasks.
There are currently still 50 unfilled positions at the district of Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of the general administration are sought.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.
According to the wishes of the parties, the administration is to "work out a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the shortage of applicants in a future-oriented manner.
The overall concept should be based on internally and externally, to identify concrete measures for lateral entrants and to include a training offensive, demand the CDU, FDP and UWG.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle is dealing with personnel problems that you did not know before.
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
The talk is of a veritable "competition of public employers".
In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act, so that more vacancies do not remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes with his party even beyond the joint request.
He recently caused a big surprise in the district council, when he publicly questioned the personnel cost capping and the other parties astounded.
Völker wants to review all the possibilities that allow an exit from the municipal employers' association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should strive for a house tariff with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district-member cities," said Völker.
In doing so, the CDU is trying to pay the employees and civil servants better than the tariff regulations for the public service actually provide.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, there are increases or more money only if you switch to a higher level, which is based on professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act.
Not least due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, District Administrator Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.
Italy tightens tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs using lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue this if they do not abide by new rules for their operations.
"If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with Turin's La Stampa daily.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation 'Jugend Rettet' because their crew had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid agency, which has only been in operation for a year, declined to comment on extensive allegations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority. So we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess any allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.”
Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of 'Jugend Rettet', the Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that its crew takes inflatables migrants on board, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such gathering allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of overriding the authority of the Italian coast guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons rather than for any other motives.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have mainly an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "substantial changes or obstructions" of their bailouts.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue efforts had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors had borne fruit.
"Over the past few days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries hoping to reach Europe.
Climbs and trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
There were three friendly guides available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.
This was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which you could see far over the Palatinate Forest and the upstream plains.
In between, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Again, viewpoint lined up at viewpoint, connected by "flowy" trials and moderate climbs.
On the last two days, many meters of altitude were again announced.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and stopovers brought welcome breaks.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open-air inhalation.
Neustadt was also targeted.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had got to know the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural.
Console instead of turf - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports
Will the sports stars be sitting in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through sweating in wind and weather over the stadium turf?
The fact is: E-sports has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees included.
This is also recognised by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly involved in this area.
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed later by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an esports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann.
He is sure "that a number of clubs are still ascending to this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Football Association is organising the first "Interactive Club World Cup" in London, where the gamers of various clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain and PSV Eindhoven have qualified, for example.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"The real football in particular has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that the young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all sorts of markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, you could be present in these markets much more often online than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-sports, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA are fought at the competition level.
As in normal sport, leagues have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, e-sports is already part of the official program.
But is it a real sport?
For many, the idea is sure to take some getting used to.
Ingo Froböse has also long dealt with the question.
For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions, which can also be found in classic sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress responses, hormonal changes.
In addition, cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding and rapid responsiveness are needed.
Professional gamers should not only train on the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
“The fit player is a good player.”
But Froböse also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more an issue".
Controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and the structures of classical sport were missing in the scene.
The scientist positively emphasizes the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are travelling internationally, which is like a large global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.
A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts a rapid growth for e-sports.
In 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to be around 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga, this is little.
However, the e-sports is "no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultants.
Internationally, many countries are already further along.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball player Shaquille O`Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez join US Team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is also a lot going on in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports was introduced as a subject, says Froböse.
In the Netherlands and France, the football first division clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department, according to Dutt.
"In a European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member Röttgermann.
To fall only into nostalgia, and to transfigure the old days, is no longer enough today.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company with the modern market.
"We live in a digitized world," says Dutt.
“You can’t say that everything stays the way it always was with football.”
Poison Eggs ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poison-loaded eggs.
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord have reacted and taken all eggs out of the sale throughout Germany.
Only eggs that are not found to contain fipronil are to be taken on the shelves.
Michelle Carter convicted of lyrics pushing Conrad Roy to suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligently killing Conrad Roy, who turned 13 in on 13. July 2014 took life.
Roy's father said Thursday at the hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal.
She had faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and down-facing eyes when she was convicted.
"Their actions have killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended his life to make her own better.
She hasn't taken responsibility," she said.
“She showed no remorse.”
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "terrible circumstance that she completely regrets."
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her "age or maturity, or even her mental illness, have a significant impact on her actions."
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, who said there is "no day when I don't mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters despite all the pain we will carry with us for eternity," it reads.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she would be "tracked" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt for his children.
"Not having that only person I've been with every day since I was born is a pain I'll always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to urge another to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in a vehicle by carbon monoxide poisoning in 2014.
The case attracted national attention after Carter's text messages revealed she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang up, jump from a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention through the death of Roy and ordered her to benefit from the case through any press.
The case has shared legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted a comment in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern's new mini-lame
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain at the Audi Cup.
FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner to have a big season - extra motivation does not hurt there.
Something was different in his place in the cabin, Joshua Kimmich saw that immediately, even if the extra garment was very, very small.
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer could be seen, he stopped the tie assigned to him.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner recounted afterwards, after his first appearance as Bayern captain.
Well, the start could have been better than the 0:2 against the SSC Naples.
But the sign from the coach could also interpret Kimmich that way.
It was not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal who was eight years older that had been chosen as a game leader in the C-Elf consisting of youth players, debutants and just retired professionals, but he.
Zuckerl is best distributed to those who you trust a lot, who you want to keep in a mood.
So who has been chosen to take up the inheritance of Lahm, can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: take responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flitted across the field as a mini-lame.
Right back, that's his position, the white bandage on the arm did the rest.
And in general, Kimmich seemed like the one who can also take the helm best in this starting formation.
He gave instructions, tried to steer the unrecorded squad.
He had the eye for the whole, while many others were busy with himself.
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness (hardly worked out); Renato Sanches with how to get out to devil’s performances of the trip to Asia (worked only to a limited extent); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not being negatively noticed in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, that worked out quite well.
Süle ran alongside Kimmich, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted confidently.
The well-known Napoli storm often had a hard time, in addition, Süle also tried successfully in the game setup a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was "not as we hoped."
But he, too, showed a decent performance on debut.
Game shift, change of pace: "I was also brought in for this style".
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the newcomers, you could see after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two in the catacombs, but certainly six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few crisp statements in the back of his new fellow players.
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn't have to teach the new ones that anymore.
Alaba motivates ÖFB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies
Austria's best-known footballer came forward via Twitter shortly before the game and wished the ÖFB ladies all the best.
The Bayern legionnaire is a club colleague of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and is cheering with our ladies.
The Austrian Footballer of the Year's tweet and Champions League winner should be a special motivational injection.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bayern-Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissing's pace
It was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Greens) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economic Affairs Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.
Frank Natus, chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest U-turn in infrastructure policy: The gap closure of Autobahn 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s list of priorities.
This year, the ministry hopes for a planning approval procedure, by 2021, the building law should stand.
The West Bypass Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan, also plays a role in the country's plans.
The aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a signpost for supporting regional but internationally competing companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier strives, as suggested by Wissing, a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been slumping for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the Chamber of Industry and Commerce.
The Trier Chamber of Crafts sees the new Meister bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros is planned for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self-employed within ten years after the master training.
The homework list for the country remains long, though.
In the case of the planned road construction, facts can be quickly created, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, Managing Director of the IHK Trier.
Out of 56 new engineers who Wissing intends to hire mobility at the state-owned company, only 29 have so far been filled.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
CDU parliamentary vice-president Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
The previous broadband expansion in the country is also sobering.
In 2016, regional companies had only rated the network supply in an IHK survey with a rating of 3.4.
They complained of stalled internet connections and break-offs.
Former Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens group left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she was already clearing the field again after four months because of disagreements.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software in more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company felt that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European carmakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for car manufacturers to install facilities to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing, making it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of coddling the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen's mistakes, which could use so-called shut-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car has been tested but driving back in normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several employees of Volkswagen have been charged, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi's engine development in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was extended.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy strain on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen's profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
So that the Isar visitors also participate, a raft will drive through Munich tomorrow Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large raft between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke.
And that's not a common raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large information transparent.
It shows a mountain of garbage.
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ..." the understanding of the Isar is to sharpen the understanding of the Isar as a wild river worth protecting.
Already last summer, the raft drove over the Isar and this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Murderillo's tuber nose and the laughter against suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon artists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: Laugh, "because there is too much suffering in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was on 4. Born in August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he became a draftsman for greeting cards, among other things - which frustrated him.
"The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost into my job," he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough at the end of the 60s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Again and again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, roundish Mordillo figures are in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
Through calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, plush toys and watches, his droll figures continue to find a lot of distribution worldwide.
He has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - that has a centipede as an opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's weird for me," Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That's why he's more likely to rely on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
He has become a symbol of Provence in the south of France, but there is a warning that he is at risk of climate change.
The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the disease-borne insects, which gives scientists and farmers trying to find solutions a great headache.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in previous years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicade, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers, it is also in high demand for perfume and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil."
Solutions that are being considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary this year.
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Krämer, guilds, traders, vagants or a countrysknechts camp are to be experienced on these days in the city center.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer: to take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a blackboard at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no rest from the violence, and while the bodies are piling up across the country, more and more journalists are involved: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012. 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats and so far this year there have been at least seven dead in seven states.
Among the latter is its editor and its inspirator of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs.
His absence is felt heartily, although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts showing his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panama hat.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are heartbroken and although the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little use to discuss security, Ibarra says.
"It's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.
“As long as we don’t know the why, we distrust everyone.”
On the morning of the 15th. May, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks wide before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot at, presumably because of the newspaper's name - which is translated as "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez, there is virtually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.
It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa, someone or several people are shot in the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are bigger than many homes for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of "quiet" when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, is broken with the blame for not being able to protect his friend.
He believes two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined forces with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 stakes.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to engage in journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation because of bold and honest coverage, and sales and advertising increased.
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to handle.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the Committee's International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history, wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October.
“You have to take on the task that you like as a journalist – either that or you play the stupid one.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn't you say what was going on?"
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird who could curse like a dock worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trusted in his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his perishment?
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive in the process.
"You don't like it when you engage with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways" to move drugs.
"These things weren't allowed," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trusting your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said, that "smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter happened with Javier."
The old rules, as he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce's staff met for security training, suddenly no cellphones were allowed. Days earlier, it was revealed that spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect Riodoce's offices in a four-story building in a mid-range district of Culiacan.
Half in jest, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It's been months since reporters have gone into the mountainous landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week's edition, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor's hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug traffickers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) that dominated all political levels almost the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile cases of corruption.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents at this local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military raid.
Just months earlier, readers would have viewed Valdez's column as the most informed source of the abduction.
"We would have known what happened before," Villarreal, 46, said nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
“Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down.”
Valdez's office has been rededicated to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting the murders of journalists because the staff have become something they themselves would never have expected: activists on behalf of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist to the prosecutor's office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body has been discovered and officials, based on DNA tests, say it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington, trying to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and having them killed for telling the truth.
She has since asked that she be reclassified by the government because she is concerned that her anger has hurt her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were "surrounded" by organized crime, government officials involved and an indifferent society.
In his last book, "Narco Journalism," he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organized crime.
The media watchdog group "Articulo 19" has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials in the past year.
"In Mexico, you die because they want you to shut up," Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a chilling effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "Here I am because of my reports."
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to her severed head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial headlined "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
It's hard to find work in exile, and they're still watching the streets, looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as is apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it's a daily dance with high-risk decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, and that's why I became a reporter," he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition was already over, Riodoce's editors sat on the sidewalk outside the office, drinking beer as all of their phones suddenly began to buzz.
A series of shootings involving gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war continued to escalate, as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.
From the curb, they have posted the news on Riodoce's website via mobile phone.
The front page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the policemen who were holding watch to see if they were on standby.
If they were scared at all, they didn't show it.
Under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing," Bojorquez said, "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the streets for reporting."
Dinosaur used camouflage to dodge his enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner's incredible rhino have been so well preserved that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a "restless past."
The report in the journal "Current Biology" described him as "the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as "really remarkable"
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivore is the best preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21. March 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, dug.
He encountered something that seemed out of place by the surrounding rock and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years revealing the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) lump of the earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
"If you blink just a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is on display.
“It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens – the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.”
Researchers have found that this herbivore, although covered with armor and resembles a walking tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its surroundings and dodge its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosaur family first made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli, according to museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor across his body.
They discovered the countershading, a common defensive method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution favored the obfuscation of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur has been subjected to a real battle for survival.
"Strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved intestinal contents, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, was run into a river and driven out into the sea, where he sank on his back to the bottom of the sea.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida was today, and rivers and oceans probably spread far further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also retains it in three dimensions and retains the animal's original shape," Brown said.
“The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don’t need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. If you just squint a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he's asleep."
The Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth.
Though the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearsome ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that after death, Borealopelta sank in the sea and was mummified in the mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21. March 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, dug.
According to the museum, it's the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the snout to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-length tips that protruded from its shoulders.
The researchers believe the armored herbivore was swept through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy armored plates along the dinosaur
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as 'rare as a win in the lottery.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armored plates that carry the skull of the animal.
His right forefoot is at his side, his five fingers spread upwards.
I can count the sheds on his sole.'
In the thunderstorm: mass carambolage on A8: Many injured
Violent accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams - and gaffers.
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage late on Thursday afternoon.
According to the first data of the police, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, crashed into each other between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Aichach-Friedberg district) during a thunderstorm.
Initially, no information was available on the exact number of injured.
These were minor to moderate injuries, said a police spokesman.
A large number of emergency vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of Munich, a backlog of about ten kilometers long formed.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive disabilities on the opposite road - through numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted the license plates of the vehicle drivers, who now have to expect sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 18:45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
A collision occurred between a car transporter and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the scene of the accident.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: You are not suspecting that you sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are immersed in your work and have a brilliant thought.
And then: pufff.
Comes and wakes you up rudely or tears the passenger out of the middle of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the days of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the managerless ticket inspection.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
“If the offer arrives, we will expand it.
It is then expected to be available early next year on many more long-distance routes in Germany," a railway spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" is what the railway calls the devaluation of tickets without a conductor.
In order to be able to use them, however, some prerequisites must be met: You need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which is what most passengers are already doing.
You also have to have bought it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
And last but not least, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: You get on the train, call up your ticket under "My tickets".
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear in the test customers.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.
If the train attendant comes to place Y at the ticket inspection, he knows that a passenger with an already validated online ticket is sitting there.
So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn is supposed to benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without a ticket check through our train escort staff, simply check in yourself in the DB Navigator.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal," says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: "And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs".
Those who travel often train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you have yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers not all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or the identity card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to show.
The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large area and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor in the end takes the time to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service.
And only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How one activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"
On the 9th In August 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just a day after she arrived in New York City, she was sitting in St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"The police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still in the street," it said.
Confused, since no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline.
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was in the process of tweeting live the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body, which was stretched out in the street and would stay there for four hours.
"That's wild," Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She put her phone down to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening.
There were photos of the police tape and people screaming, and of a man who claimed to be Brown's father, wearing a sign that read: "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed in which a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unsecured his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to... Kill animals all."
"That's not common," Ferrell recalled of her statement.
“This is not the kind of murder we’ve become used to and that we can call typical.”
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 2 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father's home and decided the two would head to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in theaters from the 11th onwards.
It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resilience, that consists of the point of view of the people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter, who was wearing a floral dress and a matching crown, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning “about the black experience and the black condition.”
"You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?" she recalled what she said.
“We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
I couldn't take them with me," Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past.
She needs to know it and see it and be raised in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we must do to become free to free ourselves.
Even if I'm lucky enough to give her an experience where she personally doesn't experience blatant racism, she's no different from the next black women's child.
I feel like I'm doing her a disservice to keep her away from it."
The first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a location opposite the police department that became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who was making lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly, a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.
“My activism has become after the 9th. August totally changed," she said, noting that she is a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis president of the Minority Student Nurses Association was, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
One question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can exploit?"
This skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview: "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson didn't center their voices and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field known for his activism around death row inmates.
His involvement brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals following the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years following Brown's shooting.
“This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us. We're talking," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me, how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I will be portrayed.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement is "not a Messiah leader, but a community coming together," Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" Surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, how she falls in love and her wife marries.
"I felt like naked," Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.”
In addition, Ferrell's story echoes the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders, who coined the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media after the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identify as gay.
"Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement overall," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really upheld by black women and many black women."
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action," where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
"She was the person who stirred up that energy," she said.
“It’s not a coincidence, even though she was at the front line because in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman so much is at stake.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell is on probation for 21⁄2 years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "A mess."
Still, she clings to a singing and she's been committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose - except our chains."
From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit gallery
The bit gallery is moving people, although it is far from being built.
But the idea of a shopping centre at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
Cold leaves the subject hardly one.
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg".
While some say to the Bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really great" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).
While the proponents rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the other shops, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the Bauernmarkthalle stands, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of the construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda square with the possibility to sit outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been shopping almost weekly in the Bauernmarkthalle for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the country women always very much.
We also discovered the butcher shop for ourselves.
We would like that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.
There is also that in other cities.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the level of rent.
However, this is probably not exactly low in the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping palaces in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstore or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is already enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
However, since there is not even a decent weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved.
After all, the goods offered there are fresh, are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special shops and what is left of it will probably disappear.”
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit after Bitburg.
Above all: Where should the farmers’ market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Galerie manage to distribute all business from Bitburg beforehand?"
George Marquet: "That's just not going to work.
And a shopping center that is empty, no one needs either.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers market, instead of this gallery.
But for a farmers' market hall, thanks to the insanely many - I think - there is no more pointless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly equal - hanging from the ceiling on cables.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of cheek swabs and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year sentence after she made public classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which was held on the 2. August was opened, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from which 30 portraits of how someone might look with these genomic data, created a sharp, if somewhat intellectual, commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to the identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was convicted of 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Through the prison, her image was suppressed, so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning visibly unwell sits in a driver's seat and wears a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came up with the huge success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the waste to make a picture of what these people might look like.
That was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
"They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn't visit at the time and she couldn't be photographed, so you made contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal pen pals who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic "Suppressed Images" illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which the president would convert Chelsea's judgment and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a Kansas military prison was a welcome kind of happy gathering just days after the book was a welcome way of a happy gathering.
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition now, as Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a reason."
In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature underneath (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart), called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation, the basis of which have been gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a centipede of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist's highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
"What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome doesn't care about who we are and how openly genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the comic novella mentioned above.
She shows Manning appearing with a hands-free phone in hand from the United States' disciplinary asserics like King Kong.
"If they chill your speech, then they've won," it says.
“Never shut up.”
"It came straight from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist, who greets from Philadelphia.
“I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.”
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person yet - as anticipated in the comic book - but if she were to do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacrs, who gather together like hordes of protesters.
This was also purposeful, as was everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning's stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
"In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
“I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind its liberation.”
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford wanted for killing
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were arrested for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau issued, as evidenced by the files of the Cook County District Court.
The documents say Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches.
A community warning system released by the Chicago Police Department says the body was on the 27th. July was discovered.
Officers received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still pronounced dead at the scene of what happened, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem is now on leave and had been barred from entering Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating on this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help U.S. investigators in every possible way."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to turn himself in.
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he urged the suspects to turn himself in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip saying something had happened in apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also occurred on 27. July took place.
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza's management team released a statement to residents: "The police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background, exploring a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
“At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the Roadmap, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to complying with the code, which describes the criteria for reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, he contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list notes that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Referring to the matter, Mutko said: "We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no government programs, and we will not admit something that does not exist."
Mutko's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of Russia's independent anti-doping commission.
Speaking to Russia's sales outlet Sport at the start of the day, Smirnov admitted to problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
RUSADA was barred from conducting doping checks in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving "in the right direction" to be deployed again.
Aldi is no longer selling eggs
This was announced by the business groups.
It was a mere precautionary measure, it could be further assumed of no health impairment, said the message.
From now on, only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi, which have been proven to have tested negative for anti-lice agent containing fipronil.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The start-ups that will help your business not to become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness among her employees at her e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.
"There just never was consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She called people from the outside for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies figure out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, target specific groups and demographic groups, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board directly.
"You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill down on why.
Companies are coming to realize that staying at the forefront of workplace culture so you don't become the next Uber to get involved in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke have been punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could own more than $118.7 billion in value in 2020, according to the financial engineering website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw rising interest and activity in discredit earlier this year amid the Uber case.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send tailored "pulse" surveys, collect confidential responses in real-time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And when the chief executive is involved, complaints go directly to the supervisory board.
"The court of public opinion has captured regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically, it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts, employee turnover and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was not a good way to pursue the complaints of staff.
Now that the company is using Convercent, issues that were previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to that holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's Risk Management Group.
“And we are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation.”
Companies began taking ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed over ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took time for the "Social Media to come to their right" that companies realized that you couldn't prevent their dirty laundry going online.
"Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that finds approval from venture capital investors who have both supported start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in February funding from firms including Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising all of the capital to $47 million.
Glittern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its total financing to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise given the connected nature of business, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today’s employees expect more from their workplaces than before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"If people are happy to be in a company, feel that their voices belong, and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies are doing well. Companies run well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture important.
But the data is useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if change doesn't come fast enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
"If you're asking for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.
“For if you don’t follow, employees will ask yourself, ‘Did you really hear me?
You'll take care of that?
And if you don't care about it, why should I? "
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, according to Errett.
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to a better retention of workers in an industry known for high sales.
"If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
“And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It's about 23 o'clock, when a crowd of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team's new practice fields on campus.
Some have taken off their jersey tops and show off the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes represent a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
"This is a real treadmill for the boys the next three days," Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday turned into Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players, and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday.
Therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19:15 to meet the already packed schedules of the players.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of camp almost a week after last season and conducted practical exercises during summer school for the first time during Mora's six seasons in Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 exercises over the course of August. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for their kick-off against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said that he supported the rule change of the NCAA, even if it added another point to the busy routes of the players.
"We put that enormous strain on them for three or four days, and it's very challenging," Mora said.
“And they just pushed it through, they keep grapping, they’re great people.
I think once we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is finished, which, given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, an upscale class hotel already pelted with footballs clearing a protective net behind a goalpost, will not be an easy task.
Bruins players are scheduled to occupy the hotel from this weekend, but Mora acknowledged there could be a problem once those rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not far-fetched to think that people are renting a room there and then adjust to recording an exercise there.
If you have the videotape from an exercise, it's a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in parking lot 8.
We will do the best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false news to fact-checkers from third parties and then display their results under the original post, the world's largest online social network said on Thursday. It is one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false news and send them to fact-checkers who will potentially show results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to May's presidential elections, and Germany is backing a plan that is supposed to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings like before the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-checking would be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to realizing what stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share," Sara Su, a product manager for Facebook news, said in a blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the "related article" and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his recent past, little Scotney Castle featured in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopha-like Yorkshireman with a penchant for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says wistfully.
“What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.”
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by a different, emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It's not Rhodes's first book, based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection inspired by documents at the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
"I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700's who worked for the Jacobins," he says.
“That’s his thumbprint!
And letters always smell of smoke, because at that time a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he was there himself.
I love archives!”
For someone so beaten with old papers that he is backed by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for nearly four months ("To be honest: I've overvalued my welcome a little bit") all seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, looking through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapers, gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "whiskey and started writing."
The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not get full access until 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, employees were just beginning to take care of the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch tree that two families fought for.
Guys, let everything go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse yourself in English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.
"There's a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex,'" Rhodes says.
“The peasant uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start.
Maybe the two are connected?"
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler,' in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th. century is depicted, which staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, keep going on debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise heirsses."
After the end of his deployment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has completed a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elemänmäki, the site of a sanatorium from the early 20. century that has since been demanded back by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sad to go again," he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the fucking life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old St. Mary's Chapel veiled in Rhöndorf
With the cloaking of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf, the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new umbrella brand (Rundschau from Thursday).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August, the highlight of the campaign will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth.
"Too beautiful for us.
Or is it?" the creators of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel since yesterday.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they write on their website, which was unlocked yesterday.
“But we are using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems.
Basically, we firmly believe that we, as Bad Honnefer citizens, know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than "just" a logo and a slogan, it goes on.
“It is necessary to formulate a single promise, one that gives the city a distinctive unique selling point.”
After all, it is in competition with other municipalities.
A mid-five-digit amount can cost the city of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's fear of the army
Every year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the Officer Corps in Ankara.
So too this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as it used to be, but in the prime minister's office.
The five vice-premiers and the Ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs, have now also taken part in the discussions, chaired by the Head of Government.
The civilians in the YAS were in the majority.
The government is pulling the reins in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, the air forces and the navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
Over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exiled preacher Fethullah Gulen, whom Erdogan sees as the mastermind of the coup attempt.
486 people who are said to have been directly involved in the coup attempt will be held in Ankara since this week.
Already the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt a "gift of God" as he gave him the opportunity to "completely cleanse" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
In late February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article with the headline "Unease in the military headquarters."
In the General Staff, there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifests itself, among other things, in the lifting of the headscarf ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.
In any case, the large-scale clean-up in the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan had another 7395 public servants fired by decree, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals used to be considered the actual masters of the country.
Three times they coupped, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the reform requirements of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing ahead with an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe" warned an unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, that the Turkish army will be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If this is true, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
In any case, there are doubts in the alliance after the clean-ups about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are "weakened," NATO diplomats say.
Washington changes rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the green card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
He envisages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter regulations for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and backed by the president.
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress.
“This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are spent green cards.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English, who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy," Trump said, quoted as saying by the American media.
Ministry wants to refurbish track for Rennsteig shuttle
Again and again in the past months, the future of the Rennsteig shuttle had been argued - now it should go very quickly.
Before the end of the year, construction is to be carried out on the ailing route on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the Rennsteig shuttle in the long term, construction work on the track is to begin later this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to further order and refurbish the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committed to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," said State Secretary for Transport Klaus Sühl in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the route at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this sum, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered by the state in the future, is currently being finally voted on, explained Sühl.
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Bahn as operators already agree on the technical details.
"This negotiates the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards," Sühl said.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This is to order the Rennsteig shuttle on a regular basis on December 2017.
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations, especially among tourists.
In recent months, it had been tested in the course of a pilot operation whether the route is used by enough people to order it again in the future.
The route is also in parts heavily dilapidated.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should worry
Just when you thought it couldn't get any crazier in 2017, comes a new report on the technological developments in the field of sex robots.
Yes, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the robot's eye color, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
"People make fun of them, but the companies are delivering a lot of it, and we'll get to see them a lot more often," Mr. Sharkey said in publishing his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved through artificial intelligence.
The user can also "adapt" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything, from the robot's eye color to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it's getting even more disturbing as many robots own the "personalities" that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there's the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.
"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as much adapted to your personality as possible," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She may be tired, fixated on conversation or she can be "in the mood"!"
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female traits, the allusions to rape when you take a step towards Frigid (meaning here: reluctant) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion Roxxxy compared to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a roxxxy?" the website reads.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.
Most men will, of course, not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes its rising popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what leaks from the marginal zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are emerging at a time when the rights of women around the world are threatened, where there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most chilling aspect of the television series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Handmaid') is not the graphic images, the intertwined bodies and the outstripped eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this doesn't feel like a big jump.
The goal behind these sex robots is to establish a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, that they mimic the movement of a real body.
But, in a nutshell, when it comes to their "personalities," the robots don't represent real women.
They can't separate from their companion or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a backstory, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are pleasing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Maid
Trump's great achievement?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized U.S. electorate have also divided families in small format.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-voting relatives.
We're all supposedly making an effort to burst our filter bubbles.
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she had fought with for decades because of politics, is suddenly and quite peculiarly on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it strikes me in a wider context that this also entails considerable risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we speak of "normalization" and Trump, we are referring to the creepy possibility that his antics will one day no longer repel us.
There is, however, an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans, who at once, compared to his standards, suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness.
I find myself besestled by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman these days - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) - both of which, in fact, appear to be very mild offences compared to Trump.
If Trump leaves, the Republicans' next candidate just needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels in the New York park department, and the top three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are growling and the animals twist to look over their own shoulders full of fear - extremely sinister and the chinking music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings are getting old, the skylines become too familiar to offer a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not quite all over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is, in fact, not a Swiss cottage - the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in north London.
The Central Park carousel, however, is still a strangely magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women can go on it in the 40's and all have a great time.
If I could have assessed the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars at a department store before I could go through my credit card.
In the coffeehouse at the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to introduce personality to a situation where none is required.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologetically grinning while I was tired of giving her my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for a hospital visit for the second time.
Last year, he was taken to hospital for treating cuts on his wrists, which he suffered after a case in his cell, according to prison authorities.
Pistorius was convicted of murder following an appeal by prosecutors against a first manslaughter verdict.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin at his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to this time appeal against Pistorius's six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Law Enforcement Agency said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius runs the risk of his sentence being increased to 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
The fourth graders from Fützen and Epfenhofen were the last of the Blumberg schools to be released on holiday and secondary schools.
Three of the discharge students will go to high school in the future, four to the secondary school.
Headmistress Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol for the school release, the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle, which grows up in the chicken farm, but is then released to freedom.
In addition, the lively crowd performed a musical entitled "The Eagle in the Chicken's Courtyard".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken chick, a small eagle came out.
But the hope of making him a chicken was broken, the eagle spread out its wings on a high mountain and vanished.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank's rehearsal.
The hens danced around the bet with the young cocks that carried cylinders.
The eagle stands for integration, said headmistress Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chicks), but belongs to it.
He will never be like a chicken.
His purpose is to be free.
She wished every fourth-grader that he feel accepted in his new school.
This was followed by words of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael Müller, who repeatedly intervenes in the event of classroom shortages, and the parents’ representatives.
The chick season is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is very reluctant to release her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
In the end, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
To conclude, all the students had a song of summer time and holiday time sound.
Great joy broke out among the children.
Eight first-graders have already been registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, quoted by television, said.
On the morning of 1. In Sithonia, a group of illegally camping people was arrested by police in August, including the two Bulgarians.
The same day they were released while an investigation is currently underway.
The State Department reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are putting significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place not intended for that purpose.
The checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court can impose a fine.
Software update for diesel vehicles: What those affected need to know now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the Diesel Summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust gas behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt.
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the negotiated software updates are voluntary.
"The mandatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have cheating software," says Anja Smetanin.
The Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) has ordered their retrofitting.
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
Manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the next few months, but have not yet given an exact date.
Daimler has said it will write to every person concerned.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within the scope of it.
How long will the conversions take as a whole?
"It's hard to say," says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure.
“Because we have seen that the car manufacturers have not yet voluntarily acted on the subject of the environment.”
How long will the update take?
The conversion itself could only take three to four hours in the workshop.
It could be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do motorists who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there now a threat of a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE fears that.
But in the regions where driving bans threaten.
In rural areas, there are no losses in the value of older diesels.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first awards ceremony under President Trump promises to be political.
One of the award winners does not want to come - in protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68) as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and the TV producer Norman Lear (95) are also among the honorees this year.
The awards will be handed over in early December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award winner Lear, who became known with progressive TV series, therefore already announced to refrain from participating in the gala.
“This presidency has chosen to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even deprive them of the means – and that burdens me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she would use the conversation with Trump to make her view clear.
That after former President John F. Kennedy named Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the US capital.
Previous winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living in
Roland Wacker, Haslach's city builder, retires next year.
The position is already advertised - but suitable applicants are rare.
Wacker has been a city builder for 31 years.
And the work is still great fun for him, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied, but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirement profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest opportunity.
Thus, in compliance with the regular notice periods, there should still be enough time for an induction.
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Building Law Authority for the Administrative Community, the applicant must have appropriate degrees.
Because this function the city definitely wants to keep.
If they could no longer fill them in, the citizens would have to drive to Offenburg for consultation.
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good working atmosphere and a good mood between the authority and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, which Wacker looks back on with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he is sure of the construction office and its staff.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: The transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, have been initiated.
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will cost around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right," Wacker estimates.
“All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun."
Designally, there is a large scope for a city builder.
With Haslach’s own building yard and nursery, much can be reacted to quite flexibly.
"You can make a lot of difference," says Wacker, and the design of the green areas is often praised by citizens and visitors.
Since the old town is a listed building as an ensemble, it is important to "have an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, emphasizes the outgoing city builder.
In any case, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He's a builder, "in the end, everything here runs over my table."
In terms of support and coordination, he can count on long-standing employees: Markus Neumaier (building construction) has been involved for ten years, Manfred Schöner (congrey construction) has been involved for 15 years.
Wacker also wishes that his successor stays for a long time: "We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the job".
Continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, you should be able to have a degree in graduate engineering or a bachelor’s degree with a degree in architecture and have good expertise in the areas of building regulations and construction planning law.
The municipal construction office is subject to building construction and civil engineering, site planning, land acquisition matters, administration of the municipal properties, municipal depot with construction yard and city nursery as well as lower building law authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on lines: Southern railway line closed
According to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track overpass in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators are going out to be home to two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, a pink scooter and a bicycle rider had been observed by witnesses.
"This goes far beyond a lousy prank," ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch told APA.
The perpetrator(s) would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the costs for the rail replacement traffic, the railway customers could also come to the perpetrators.
Overall, a "significant" sum is to be expected, the spokesman said.
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be managed without hindrance.
Almost ten passenger trains had failed Friday morning, two of which concerned long-distance traffic.
Freight trains did not fail, but they were delayed.
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms, researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not invade the body.
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease can result from this.
Experiments have found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacteria in their intestines.
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells.
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet promote more tolerant, less inflammatory gut environments when the same system works in humans as well.
The Postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected the difference had to do with the mice's gut microbiomes - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA-sequenced and six species of bacteria were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells, but were missing without them in the mice.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, researchers let L. reuteri grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have committed a 'genius' with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, a "genius" has signed with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
Chelsea's £40 million signature began with a 2:1 win in Dublin, the final pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday, and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched forward at will.
However, Matic had been ruled out of the Blues' preparatory Asia tour and managed just 45 minutes, which Mourinho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
“We will help him be ready sooner than later.”
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four senior new commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they have put in a lot of effort.”
Boeing "paints" Dreamliner in the sky
US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington, but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and pulled over the USA in the form of a Dreamliner, which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was the shape of a Dreamliner.
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines.
Boeing had previously advertised this.
Thus, the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low blow for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD leader, Social-Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Just no sturgeon fires from the party headquarters, just no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, that has fundamentally changed.
Since then, the employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals with growing horror.
What Schulz has gotten from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with headwinds in the approach.
It was low blows.
One by one.
The Federal CDU sees after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU Secretary General Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise factional exit of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the state election, his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the opposition of the CDU and FDP.
Greens Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the breakaway Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The conversion to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the voters.
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate," the Federal Executive and campaign manager of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true," sighs an SPD election campaigner, as the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transfer of the Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without its own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD state associations.
And no one knows what's next.
The plight began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, nothing more, the comrades at the time calmed down.
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
That was it - and everything got significantly worse.
The defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tumble, the Düsseldorf bankruptcy the party smoothly.
The comrades rallied again in the weeks after.
Then, when they had just taken new courage, came the G-20 summit from Hamburg.
And with him came the next low blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD head of state, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned.
And because in crisis communication afterwards he did pretty much everything wrong that you can do wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
Now also Stephan Weil.
Because of the VW exhaust affair and his role on the supervisory board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been criticized for some time.
Bad poll ratings were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely for this reason, Weil tried to set more and more accents in the past few weeks.
The effort of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz.
They had him granted, since they promised Weil a stabilization of the party.
Now the exact opposite could happen.
Weil is basically not to blame for the party-internal dispute of the Lower Saxony Greens.
And certainly not Schulz.
For the time being, the comrades are therefore trying to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and especially on the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is unbearable and damaging to democracy how Ms. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," Matthias Miersch, head of the party's left in the SPD parliamentary group, tells the editorial network Germany (RND).
Ms Twesten has been elected to parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate, but via the state list of the Lower Saxony Greens, the Lower Saxony MP continued.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD parliamentary group, laments an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The will of voters four years ago was clear: the people have made Stephan Weil the prime minister," Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the top candidate in the federal election, tells the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP distorts the election result," Oppermann continued.
He called for the background to be cleared up.
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony.
Funding for the centre of the village III
If you want to renovate your ageing house, you can get support from the country soon.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtentwicklung informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look back at what has happened so far.
Since 1991, there have been rehabilitation areas in Empfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two-thirds of the funding amount.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is ultimately important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new construction areas.
On the 4. April was informed by the Karlsruhe Government Bureau that there will be a rehabilitation area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros would come from the state, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How is a rehabilitation area created?
Schindler continues to investigate where the "really old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in refurbishing the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday night.
Keller presented the contents of the federal-state program "Social City", in the context of which the renovations would then be carried out.
The core of the program is the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be carried out on an object-related basis, that is, per plot.
The redevelopment area would then eventually be set as a statute.
The grant period for the grants has been running since the 1. January 2017 until 30. April 2026.
However, the inventory would be carried out until September this year, in which the participants in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire to fill in.
If possible, the statute decision should be made in November or December, so that the renovations can be started in the coming year.
Pietzschmann subsequently explained that each municipality had to carry out the said preliminary investigations.
It is about assessing the urban development grievances and deciding when to remediate and to what extent.
A renovation notice will then also be entered in the land register for the respective property.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Reception again and get a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires, which will be sent to the citizens by post in the coming weeks and can be filled out until after the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and property arch", which deals, among other things, with the structural condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and apartment arch", information on the size, division and residents of a living space can be provided.
The blue "company sheet" must only be completed if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not an application for funding at the same time.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler emphasized that the distribution of the subsidies works according to the "sighthound principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make the attendees a renovation "palatable".
British inventor puts himself a microchip to get into the house and car with a hand movement
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between the thumb and index finger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He got himself with Dr. Geoff Watson, an advisory anaesthesiologist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, joined together to ensure the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standard.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr Northam's company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of £300 per castle.
The married father of one has now installed technology both at home and on his BMW Z4, which begins when his hand is at the wheel.
White House advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands
The White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month is costing taxpayers up to $24,000, according to the military's data left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was at the heart of the event on the 17th. July at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials took a tour of products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it's such an unusual high-visibility event," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his supervisor, the deputy naval commander for aviation.
The message indicated that the helicopter was on the 17th. July arrived at around 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 3pm, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18:00 and 21:00 that evening.
The note adds that in case the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of service hours.
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
The records provided to TIME did not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision.
"One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked," the deputy commander replied.
The "Made in America" event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But official events also have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave an impetus for health care reform that was underway in the Senate, and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for the trip.
But requesting their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was doing taxi services against the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is excited about the show "Made In America" - which shows products from all 50 states that are made by American workers with American materials," White House deputy press secretary Lindsay Walters said.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to depose the U.S. president at the White House with precise centimeters.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the flight crew's training needs for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for "non-presidency support missions."
The White House said taxpayers did not take the burden on any of the other props featured at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the U.S. Department of Defense's hourly rate for the 2017 budget year, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the aircraft's flight time as 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility's home base in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
"Setting the cost to taxpayers based on estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading," Walters said.
“These estimates include staff, maintenance, and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contracting.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the helicopter's use for the event.
"The idea is to present things this week that are made in America," Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not thousands, of people are dependent on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight that."
It was not clear if Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before tricky task
Frontrunner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga will compete in the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will compete tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third-placed Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite still flawless record after five games, the front-runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has retained the sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has respect for the opponent.
“This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I find the team very good.”
Imports from the far north ensure class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV.
“Their Danes and Finns may even point to stakes in the Davis Cup.
And they are also strong in the doubles," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre Göransson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen as well as Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, this is going to be hard for us.
You also need a good dose of luck.”
The Neuss team for the trip to the far north is practical.
His debut for blue-and-white could give Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman, who is currently still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella, Italy, does not make it to the Bundesliga game, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays at the tournament in the Czech Republic, will make his first appearance this season.
The previously undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be in Kiel, as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club on the Alster, Máté Valkusz could also return to the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still the number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills up the squad.
How America can harm OMV
Donald Trump did not look really happy when he put his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia on Wednesday night.
"In its haste to enact the law," Congress had packed a few "unconstitutional regulations," he etched.
The reaction from Moscow, too, was as sharp as expected, and even Brussels frothed against the US push.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, have since been worried.
The threatening backdrop is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an assessment of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil company.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would still have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
Twelve weapons are up for him.
"The press" looked at which of the company could fend off and which could really hurt it.
Narco's Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be put in the spotlight in Netflix's hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar's killer, Netflix's series is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving its first trailer and showing the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the world's richest organization of drug trafficking: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate "like a Fortune 500 company" only with more government bribes and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is her head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, the guy who invites American and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
Narco's third season will be on the 1. Start September.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen aids
The city organizes the daycare lunch table itself again.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
In the city's daycare centers, the clock is turned back.
To the 1. In September, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the municipal day-care facilities (Kitas) again on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the Department of Youth Welfare, this is good news: "We were all very pleased".
Cooking continues to be out of the house: a caterer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked food chilled.
The city operates 46 daycare centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunchtime.
In the past year, 2800 children each sat at the tables, and the need is growing steadily.
"In the meantime, not only children who are looked after 45 hours a week eat lunch in the daycare center," explains Pommeranz.
“The offer is also valid in 35-hour care if children stay until 2 p.m.”
46 part-time workers have from the 1st. September Kitchen service: They heat the delivered food, supplement them with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clear, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are firmly assigned to a daycare center," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the length of the hour.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the daycare team," says Pommeranz with satisfaction.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the daycare management to implement pedagogical concepts".
Because that's also what it's all about: healthy eating and cooking lessons.
“The children should help prepare the food.”
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
for the children as well.
“They have a well-known power in daycare, a person who is familiar to them, and not constantly changing people.”
This continuity is important for the children.
The cleaning of the daycare rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also the charm that it has proven to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self-direction and external allocation for the city, it is said from the press office.
And that's even though 46 part-time workers are being rehired.
"But these hours are not so important in around 750 people in the field of education," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on women's political role, the UN says
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in council elections in the provinces. Three women are running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the election process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on 5. April instead.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincides with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, the elections will be peacefully handed power from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further reinforce Afghanistan's democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Electoral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men, aged 19 and 23, are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police information, the men approached the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolping Street, at around 2:55 p.m. because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl's mobile phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and went on with her friends.
As a result, one of the perpetrators tried to grab the girl's mobile phone and necklace, but failed.
Without prey, the duo fled.
The two young men could later be arrested by police.
The investigation is ongoing.
GMB concern over investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow
A union wants to make sure with managers of the biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work at the plant, which manufactures hobnobs and rich tea biscuits alongside other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than £5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would be "the first to know" if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company's store manager, GMB Scotland called on McVitie's to "voice concerns that funding for the modernisation of production lines will not be pushed."
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy, said: "The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the greater Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The branch manager at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment among employees and union representatives.
We had a regular meeting two months ago with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some questions were discussed openly.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive.
She added: "Over the past few years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility. Should our operations at the site change, the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar three years ago?
La Liga's side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not let up in their pursuit of Neymar after making an offer of £189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona about the world record robbery three years ago?
The sensational approach has fuelled the transfer window in the summer, as the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for £89m last season.
After the end, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are angry at the way Neymar forced his way out, though a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since arriving from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club who wanted to have one of PSG's best players signed.
"I'm not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will be in opposition to them, we will contact their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
“We respect all the clubs.
But if they try to have one of our players signed with them, that will have consequences.”
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of that interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Scooter overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator intentionally knocked over a scooter parked in Königsfelder Straße in front of the property number 30 and thus caused property damage to the disguise of the vehicle of over 200 euros.
The police Schramberg, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for clues.
Police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car came to meet him in his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to dodge and touched the guardrail.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on the B 215 coming from Stolzenau with his VW at around 19:55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau in the direction of Leese.
In the area of the bypass of Stolzenau, a car came to meet him in his lane, so that he had to dodge to the right.
In the process, the Touran driver touched the guardrail.
There was property damage to the car.
The driver of the oncoming passenger car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued its journey without worrying about the road accident.
According to the accident victim, it may well be that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
Police are now asking witnesses to the incident, as well as the driver of the polluter vehicle, at Tel. 05761 / 92060 to contact the Commissioner's Office in Stolzenau.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Spats continues to cause discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church", declared after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as from the cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict XVI.
It would be very much for the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret over their own omissions or their then wrong assessment of the events.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano", on the other hand, criticized that in the reporting of violence in the cathedral sparrows, "double standards" are measured.
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that these are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that must be punished and prevented in the future; however, the "degree of media manipulation" was striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee.
"The habit of calling the Catholic Church the source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and preparing public opinion to think that's normal," Scaraffia writes.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk: "You like to go to the church and that's a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth, "beatings had been a normal educational means" "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."
She would find it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Completely wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the book of remembrance "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by the lawyer Ulrich Weber, who was commissioned by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment?
A total of 547 Regensburg cathedral sparrows were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 cathedral sparrows.
The final report states to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "In summary, it can therefore be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accused, it is noticeable that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even associate positive memories with him despite violence.
In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg cathedral sparrows Georg Ratzinger relieves him in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Incidents of the exercise of violence on guards at the Regensburg Cathedral Spats" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
For one thing, many students highlight his "humanity."
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a cathedral sparrow did not perform a top performance musically.
How do you, as his biographer, evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is even found in it.
He is dedicated to just eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-scientific in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the preschool also occurred outside of its sphere of activity.
At best, he can be accused of learning about it too late or of not taking initial insinuations seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all respondents as - so literally - "salvation," "heaven" and "better world."
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also issue a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, cookies and candies and was "always surrounded by grapes of children."
Only a minority complain about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also led to outbursts of anger.
The fact that he not only slammed with chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed slaps and pulled too naughty boys by the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for it.
To his rescue of honour, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, the 1960s and 1970s, both among parents and teachers.
Do you also know such methods of chastisement?
Of course, I think every one of us that was born before 1968.
I, too, have experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared with what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in the preschool, these are, of course, trivials.
One wonders whether it is not more to do with his fame and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI that many media outlets have just fallen on him.
Many who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian Pope.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect!
In the media, a lot was reported in connection with the report about the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Spatzen.
In the final report, is Georg Ratzinger also accused of any involvement or knowledge with regard to sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: Clearly no.
Not a single one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have confided in the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were initiated.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one person, representing the others, "I was very embarrassed."
The real problem with solving sexual abuse was and still is that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even confide themselves in parents and siblings, then certainly not a choirmaster, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally.
How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger’s role with regard to the abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student surveyed put it this way: "In terms of sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.
I think it's also really absurd to assume that he... Boys have opened more hauntingly or more clearly or even more than to their parents, boarding school managers, trust teachers, etc.
That you talk to him about sex ... unthinkable."
Thus, the report comes to the very clear conclusion: "The fact that students and/or their environment concerned in advance entrusted themselves to him could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore to be acquitted of any sympathy.
So he can not be accused of not preventing him or of having brought him to the notice.
Therefore, there is also no reason to associate his good name with these obnoxious crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media there was much to read about "Violence Excesses" at the Regensburg Cathedral Spats.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Looking away".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That is the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the reporting into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.
Yet that, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
Because it is neatly separated: between the preschool and the high school of the cathedral sparrows, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and, let's say, other allegations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the cathedral sparrows.
All the terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were literally harassed and maltreated by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all happened at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only saw the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium.
On this, as the vast majority of witnesses point out, the subject of "preschool" was taboo.
One was only happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiacal" conditions.
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was already discipline, but not sadistic violence.
And this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence".
Thus, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.
Yet despite all its efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which it was told of the conditions in preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just beginning to establish himself and did not want to hear about the events at a school where he just did not work and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out to him that "in the preschool the beating penalty is still practiced".
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention.
This was, of course, at a time when there was legal clarity when beating penalties had long been banned in Bavaria.
Before that, they occurred in a legal gray area, as each of us probably still knows.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been crossed.
You can't say he'd always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the beating penalty at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "trick of anachronism", i.e. the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not, of course, apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times and also not to what was committed in preschool in the preschool of obnoxiousness and violence against innocent child souls, this goes far beyond what was usual at the time.
This is all quite terrible and I'm glad it's finally being worked up.
But at the same time, I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of discipline and punishment, i.e. slaps and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then banned, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in the discussions with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Was the subject of beating punishment also discussed?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, i.e. Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, the cathedral sparrows only played a supporting role.
Nevertheless, I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form a world-class institution out of the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburg cathedral sparrows, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With cookies and sweets alone, you don’t make any great singers out of unruly boys and are facing every success, no matter in which field, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.
As a person, did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the conversations about her book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I got to know Georg Ratzinger really well and experienced again and again as a wonderful, humorous, fundamentally gracious, deeply believing and good-hearted person, of whom you can not imagine that he could do even to a fly.
I regularly get along with how many former cathedral sparrows still keep in regular contact with him today, 23 years after his retirement, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him to this day for being strict with them are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most of the cathedral sparrows today are grateful to him for enriching their lives and introducing them to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but was also a lovable respectful person, to whom they still look up today and whom they worship.
And please, once again quite clearly: all he is accused of are methods of education, which were the order of the day at the time.
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time.
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to the media scapegoat.
There is the evil intention behind it all too obvious.
Because the report, which has just been published, relieves him.
Now the decency would require a 93-year-old man, who has earned great merits and without whom outside Bavaria and perhaps still Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.
