Biker reacts at lightning speed and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured thanks to his quick reaction.
Driver overlooks biker
A 44-year-old female motorist wanted to turn left with her VW from Merklingen on the state road 1230 in the direction of Machtolsheim around 21.30.
Here she overlooked the 24-year-old right-of-way motorcyclist coming from the direction of Nellingen.
In the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still swiped it at the rear vehicle area.
As a result of the grazing process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
Presently, he steered his motorcycle in the green stiffs next to the road and let it roll out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
As a result of the collision with the car, the biker nevertheless suffered an injury to the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvest workers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on going out.
A total of 174 harvest workers tested positive for the coronavirus pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series investigation, the district office Dingolfing-Landau announced on Saturday evening.
"In order to avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," explained Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already become infected in the company - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to citizens to keep calm: "According to our information, it is a closed group of people".
In the yard, infected people have been separated from uninfected employees, the site is now surrounded by a barrier fence.
Greens and SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of the shelters of seasonal workers.
"This can be bitterly avenged if such local infection events have to be elipped and regional lockdowns have to be ordered," said Jürgen Mistol, the Green Party's parliamentary managing director.
The SPD sees this quite similarly: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program also for farms with harvest workers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions in the workplace and the living conditions must be sharply controlled in our view.
That obviously didn't happen."
The outbreak came "with announcement."
U-Bahn station Aidenbachstraße: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls after push into the track bed
In a dispute between two youth groups at the U-Bahn station Aidenbachstraße, a 19-year-old fell through a push and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday, there was a dispute between two youth groups at the U-Bahn station Aidenbachstraße around 16.15 clock.
A passer-by alerted police, who approached with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slid over the platform edge and fell into the track bed.
People from the 17-year-old's group helped the fallen man climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming railway.
According to the police, there were then again clashes between the two people.
The 17-year-old initially fled the scene of the crime, but his personal details could be determined afterwards.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police inspection 29.
The 17-year-old is being investigated for assault.
Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended retention of data - instead of the planned ten weeks half a year.
As the "Bild am Sonntag" reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change in the law.
Seehofer wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He said it makes sense to "make urgently needed adjustments in the law already now," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Data retention is currently suspended.
A decision by the ECJ is expected.
Seehofer, however, wants the changes beforehand so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive verdict, the report continues.
A Justice Department spokesman told the newspaper that it could only be meaningfully examined whether legal adjustments were needed if the courts had ruled.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already advocated data retention in June.
NBA: Stripclub trouble for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament quarters at Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit, is back in Isloation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for the visit: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou," as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, ed. R.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has prescribed a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the Test match phase.
At Disney World, the NBA wants to end the corona season.
Currently, the best 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale starting at night on Friday.
Söder comments after mass infection on corona situation
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has spooked authorities and politics.
Nearly 500 harvesters from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, and over a third have become infected with the coronavirus pathogen.
The yard is now under quarantine and is cordoned off with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the more than 3300 residents of the municipality.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district office so far assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
'Conscience bites': Confession of the alleged Nantes arsonist
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defense attorney added: "He very much regrets the actions, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "afflicted by remorse and very much taken away by the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, the man threatens, according to the prosecutor's office, ten years imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes was badly damaged in a fire during the night on Saturday.
The fire had broken out in three distant places in the church.
Laboratory investigations confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, who has now been detained, was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the Diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace for a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly came into the field of view of the investigators.
Discussing the abolition of the 50+1 rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended that the abolition of the 50+1 rule be considered.
"German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates consummate facts," Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors for associations that want to break into this phalanx."
However, he has doubts whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk to draw investment fences around the business location Bundesliga in a European single market," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to provide for more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will in the end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at the European level, but not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not achieve a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," the 58-year-old explained.
Looking to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been individuals who have noticed this mistake and pierced on the press instead of addressing me," Grindel said of the acceptance of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
"That's what kept me very busy humanly."
He had received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance breach, and it was right to draw the consequences from that," Grindel said.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift completely transparent and careless.
Many in the DFB knew about it."
He never "made a secret of the gift," the 58-year-old assured.
"That may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have once again intensified as a result of Donald Trump's use of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between protesters and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunfire while a demonstration train just crossed an intersection.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
Security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on the night of Saturday, violently driving protesters apart.
Hundreds of, partly armed protesters marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held accountable.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March during a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
As on Saturday, a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot was three people injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to hospital.
None of them were in danger of their lives.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
There was ultimately no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, a person was shot and died in the wake of a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration.
Police said they were taking a suspect into custody.
She has not yet provided further details on the circumstances of the crime.
Mayor Steve Adler said he was, like many in the city, "inconsolable and stunned" because of what happened.
Also in the American metropolis of Seattle, protesters delivered clashes with the police on Saturday.
They set fire to construction trucks in front of a youth prison, the police used blinding grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.
A courthouse has been set on fire in the city of Oakland, California.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down firecrackers and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night (local time).
The fire could be extinguished quickly.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver in Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
Police said one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was taken to hospital injured.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was set, the police said.
Investigations have been commenced.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big buzz was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy weekend without Rakoczy festival.
But: Even if the big party mile in the city center was missing, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale burns, Rakoczy ball or pageant, many got their money's worth in the corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we managed to spread Rakoczy flair," says spa director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, when the historicals alone were the focus of the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser has always visited Bad Kissingen with her husband for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, watched the historics stroll and listen to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I think it's so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She misses the crowds that otherwise don't belong to Rakoczy.
But it lacks the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic pageant and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a shame.
The weather would have been a great fit this year," she said.
Rakoczy riding tournament to take place again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative program sometimes meant more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who participates in the pageant in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the spa garden café.
This year she was on Saturday and Sundays in costume on foot in the city.
"It's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she said.
The riding club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be allowed to take place again in the coming year," says chairwoman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of pause in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament is also to take place again.
28 corona cases at Spanish second division club Fuenlabrada
Spanish soccer second division club CF Fuenlabrada is sliding ever deeper into crisis because of a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid despite first corona cases on 20. July had flown to a game in the city of A Coruña, one low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had tested positive, one came to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid has so far still had the chance to reach the promotion playoffs.
Now even the relegation to the B-Group of the Second League threatens.
The match against Deportivo La Coruña last Monday was canceled at the last moment, the prosecution is investigating for a possible offence against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced relegation of the club.
The players, as well as other team members, sit in quarantine at a hotel.
"By the sixth day of quarantine, they have not received a fresh towel and a gel," the sports newspaper "AS" wrote.
In photos, it can be seen how players had hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel to dry, after they apparently had to wash them themselves.
The bed linen was also not changed for five days.
Another problem is food.
Neither is it good nor sufficient, wrote "AS."
The club management, on the other hand, said it was satisfied with the hotel.
The club's lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, dismissed the accusation of intentionally endangering public health.
They did not violate the corona rules set up by the Football Association, emphasized the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, as the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca" reported.
Before the departure, it has until 19. July four infected people were given, but all of whom were isolated and did not travel with them.
Right before Monday's flight to A Coruña, all players and team members had been re-tested.
When the team was already in A Coruña, the corona test was positive for "five or six" other team members.
The game was canceled 60 minutes before kick-off, Tebas Llanas said.
Police must capture horses ripped out at Dampfach
Two animals were on the road.
Police led her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning shortly before 6 a.m., a road user informed two free-roaming horses on the feeder between the junction of Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officers arrived, the horses were already again between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the confidence of the horses could be gained by the officers shortly before Dampfach, they each had a rope carried in the patrol car turned over.
Cycling pro Tony Martin: Career continuation imaginable
Time trial specialist Tony Martin is considering a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time world time trial champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just sticking out with the team the framework conditions for how and in what form it could go on," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.
Martin is currently employed by the Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had considered ending his career after this year before the corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or for other problems that would plague him as a family man, Martin said.
He used to get up after a fall, and the first thought was: "Quickly back on the bike.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if.
The professional cyclist acknowledged that there were certainly aspects with which he was increasingly difficult.
"But it was good for me to know from the Corona time what I have in cycling and how much it is for me".
The time trial specialist climbs at the Tour de l'Ain (5. to 9. August) back into the competition.
Bayern: At least four dead on Bayern's roads over the weekend

For at least three people, the tour with the motorcycle ends fatally.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also dies.
Schönthal - In the case of accidents on Bavaria's roads, several, mostly young people died over the weekend.

In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his machine.
He was downhill at Beilngries, according to police.
In a left turn, he bounced against the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, a man was seriously injured and a man slightly injured, the police said.

The driver could not brake in time.
At Schönberg (Freyung-Grafenau district) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker crashed head-on against a car in a right-hand turn despite full braking.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the remaining three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by Bavaria's Transport Minister Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).

Kovac to test with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac, there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will perform on 1. August (18:00) at the Hesse, the former club of the Croatian.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only hardship test before the return match in the Europa League against FC Basel (6. August).
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the encounter will be held without spectators.
“We are especially looking forward to this game.
It's always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends," Kovac explained.
Sportingly, that's an interesting test, the 48-year-old said.
Before joining Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached the Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I'm looking forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," Eintracht coach Adi Hütter said.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded the Croatian at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the first round match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Nearly 50 new infections: County of Hof narrowly past lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new corona infections has increased further over the weekend: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person is recovering and no longer falls into this statistic) to 47 on Sunday.

700 killed by monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people have been affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
Because of the heavy monsoon rains, a total of 700 people were killed.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent in boats strives to reach the isolated people.
Entire villages are underwater.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Tank rhinos in national park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are under protection and those considered to be endangered.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which scientists are due to climate change.
Bangladesh is one of the countries most hit by global warming, according to the United Nations.
New apartments are empty
In the town of Cox's Bazar in southern Bangladesh, the state has built housing for 650 displaced by the floods.
So far, few have moved in.
It's hard to take people to Cox's Bazar.
The enthusiasm is also on the limit.
If you used to have a house, it was still so small and like a hut, often does not want to spend your life in a large apartment block.
Many apartments are empty, but - as the government wants it - should soon be occupied by those who have lost their house due to the floods.

Argentina rejects counter-offer from creditors
The new demands could not be met, the economy ministry in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
“While 50 percent of the children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term gains of our creditors.”
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer viable on current terms.
That is why Argentina is demanding from its private creditors to forgo part of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If no agreement is reached, the country threatens to bankrupt again.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contract clauses.
The Argentine government, however, is sticking to its last offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a severe financial and economic crisis.
The inflation rate was more than 50 percent recently.
For the current year, experts expect economic power to decline by around ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest claims amounting to US$503 million and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Professionally arrived - private not yet
"It's going super good" - this conclusion draws Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first days at the notary's office in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learns that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden Notary Office.
Just six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer started work, the normal day-to-day business has long been running in full.
"I still have to arrive privately," she explains in an interview with the Rottaler Anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time was of course not enough to move the center of life from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
Currently, she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who works as a judge at the regional court in Regensburg.
At least her husband was still able to apply for short-term parental leave in order to be able to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighboring district, the city of Eggenfelden has of course been a household name for her for a long time.
During visits on site with her family in the past few months, she again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had made the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career plays a central role in her native Lower Bavaria: After studying law in Passau, she completed her legal traineeship and the 2. State examinations in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, including in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she also "shouldered" her doctorate in employment law - she took up her first position as a notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representative services in various notary offices.
When the job in Eggenfelden was advertised because of the approaching retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for the full professional re-entry, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of its predecessor, which will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has Dr. Stefanie Kramer completely taken over - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on well-rehearsed processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food center.
In terms of kindergarten or nursery places, she has already contacted a local institution.
And if everything works out as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The biggest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent filled at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
"Due to the distance regulation, which is mandatory, we are planning according to the current status with 12,000 to 15,000 spectators," Borussia Dortmund's managing director Carsten Cramer told the Tagesspiegel.
Normally, the arena in the precinct city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games of the past season caused by the corona pandemic, the BVB had lost around four million euros per game.
The Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitization and internationalization at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4000 places in the hospitality sector can be opened again: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues completely break away".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need is limited to entertainment," Cramer explained.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their partial salary waiver, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary waiver has a different effect than when we put 100 people who work in merchandising on short-time work".
Tiny miracles: Early start into life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a pack of butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The boy is one of around 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children's Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini-diapers made especially for them.
But not so small that they wouldn't be in voice - "and how," smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loudly as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the classroom: The whiteboard as a stage experienced just before the start of the holiday the 9. Classes of the St. James High School in Abtsgmünd.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the Theater der Stadt Aalen presented the production "Das Heimatkleid" to the students - via video.
Afterwards, the students were able to exchange information about the play and the performance via Skype with the actress and the director Winfried Tobias.
The idea for the performance format from the current corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the lessons.
Even though at the end all participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage space would offer additional charms, the theatre also sees the potential for contact in the schools.
"If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation," emphasized director Winfried Tobias.
First round drawn: The TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This was the Sunday draw.
Munich - Sixty's possible opponent in the first round of the DFB Cup is fixed.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This was the result of the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD sports show.
Because the field of participants is not yet complete due to the corona pandemic, placeholders were used in the draw.
Due to the voluntary renunciation of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4. or 5. September).
There, the Lions meet either the Würzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should second-tier Würzburg reach the final, Sixty would already be firmly qualified for the first round in the DFB Cup.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final match against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will be between 11 and 14. September and thus one week before the third league start.
'Blown away by the wind': Film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died on Sunday in Paris at the age of 104 of a natural death, her spokeswoman for the German Press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the Southern epic "By the Wind" (1939).
Born in Tokyo to British parents, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a toddler.
Austrian theatre man Max Reinhardt spotted the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream."
The film studio Warner Brothers signed her for seven years and brought her out big alongside Eroll Flynn.
She made eight films with the heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own."
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress."
She was also widely recognized as a neurotic eccentric in "Der dunkle Spiegel" and "Die Schlangengrube".
Daphne du Maurier proposed her in 1952 for the lead role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousin Rachel."
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she starred in "Lullaby for a Corpse."
The marriage to the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) gave rise to the son Benjamin.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had the daughter Gisèle with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumours of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss final on comeback
World Championship runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they lost in the semi-finals to their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Thole/Wickler last played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September of last year.
In the final match on the Rhine, their defeats Ehlers/Flüggen against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played out in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: The tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "fig leaf"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is from the point of view of the FDP only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," FDP interior politician Benjamin Strasser told the dpa news agency in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of trial the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had decided in May majority.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Björn Höcke as well as his supporters would have been excluded long ago," Strasser said.
"There is no political will to do this in the AfD, however, because right-wing extremism now belongs to the party."
Similarly, CSU Secretary-General Markus Blume commented: "That Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper.
"It speaks rather volumes, how many frenetic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has."
Blume expects the AfD to land below five percent again in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in the parliaments are numbered."
Kalbitz was one of the spokespersons of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the constitutional protection classifies the roar as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD federal executive had thrown Kalbitz out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned far-right "home faithful German Youth" (HDJ) and among the Republicans.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also emphasized that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court did not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without Kalbitz."
Neither with this decision the federal party will be weakened nor the right wing.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen force is transparent.
You want to escape further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get through under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD is not getting rid of the spirits it called.
An ejection does not change anything yet," commented the Brandenburg SPD Secretary General Erik Stohn the decision in the Kalbitz case.
"Here the AfD state association and the faction held to their right leader to this day."
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he would now take civil action against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms deliver a good 21 percent more electricity
The wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid in the first six months of the year.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the Tennet grid area, have fed in another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North Sea and Baltic Sea thus reaches 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; this is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher generation capacity
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy results in addition to the wind conditions from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid in the past twelve months.
If the 1270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full force at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity by calculation.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is the 2. January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, the equivalent of three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply almost seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
That was almost a small anniversary celebration to the 130.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew the usual framework after the corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has canceled the three-day festival planned in September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have really not made this decision easy for ourselves and - aware of how difficult it is economically for those involved - hoped until the last minute," explained Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (without party).
"But ultimately, as an organizer, we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people."
Because if tens of thousands had flocked to the festival grounds and into the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing according to the current Corona Protection Regulation could not have been observed.
Or the restrictions would have been so severe that not much would have been left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organizational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg was comforting for next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9, among other things May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12. September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in Achleiten, Austria.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at the weekend in four starts.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeatable on Sunday in the Grand Prix Special and in the freestyle.
On the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth prevailed on Sunday in the special clearly against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
Also in the freestyle, the German was on Saturday on Quantaz clearly ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The world's most successful dressage rider is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first freestyle ever.
Already at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all the important four trials.
The last of the three international tournaments is there for the 14th to 16. August planned.
More air traffic controllers in Worms in the future
The Worms University continues to enter the air: The "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" is instigating a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to make the start of your studies possible not only in the summer semester, but also in the winter semester.
This allows twice as many students to be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities in both the university and the air traffic control academy of the DFS are evenly utilized.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and composition of the professorship.
Represented at the university since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management degree program as part of their training as an air traffic controller at the University of Applied Sciences Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experience of the DFS is very positive, the performance of the students is excellent.
The combination of studies and pilot training contributes significantly to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, promotion is not easy for us economically.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, overarching knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer".
This is also emphasized by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with the DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual bachelor's program Air Traffic Management".
The trust of the German air traffic control is both motivation and a commitment for Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand its teaching and research competence in the future fields of aviation.
In the work for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first endowed professorship for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasizes: "Worms University of Applied Sciences, with its focus on aviation, has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed for about 30 minutes on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove a Ford straight ahead with a Ford at about 12.40pm in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed at the guardrail.
As a result of the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries to the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The 72-year-old passenger's injuries were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient was subsequently flown to a hospital by rescue helicopter.
Currently, however, the police assume that there is no danger to life.
The damaged vehicle, which suffered damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed.
Heil wants to examine other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light again.
Law tightening is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stay with it?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other industries according to the now planned strict regulations against maladministration in the meat industry.
"We will look at industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting work contracts in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of Heil this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to use foreign personnel in the case of slaughtering, cutting and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of contract workers and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer President Ingo Kramer told the dpa: "Fingers away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary employment if you do not want to completely choke off the economy".
Contracts for work, for example, for large areas of the craft trade, the construction industry and plant construction are mandatory the basis for their added value at the customer.
"The wrongdoings of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban work contracts everywhere in the German economy."
Contracts for work are useful.
"If an industrial company commissions a craftsman to install a security system, this is a normal work contract."
The German meat industry considers a ban on work contracts and temporary work in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is not possible to explain why in the case of portioning and packaging of cheese, other employment law should apply in the future than with Wurst, according to a statement on the legislative project, as the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday) reports.
In the case of a ban, the consumer price would therefore increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
According to the results of an audit of the NRW occupational health and safety administration, Eastern European employees from contract companies often worked in the industry 16 hours a day.
Often they didn't have a break.
Pay was withheld for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "tricky constructions".
"Now must be fundamentally cleaned up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Safety Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, measures are also measures that do not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher testing rates in occupational health and safety or clear criteria for communal accommodation".
The draft, which is available to the dpa, includes amendments to the law on the protection of workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Health and Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Consumer Protection Minister Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) thinks more intensive checks are necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do even more checks in many supervisory areas: food checks, animal welfare, everything possible, for example also animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
But more personnel positions are also needed for more checks.
Three killed in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
Three people have died in the crash of an ultralight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia, according to the police.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were rescued injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the district control center Wesel.
A parachute was found at the scene of the accident, according to police.
The Rheinische Post reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash, the plane had collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were not initially disclosed.
Eviction of Frankfurter Opernplatz proceeds peacefully
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the Opera Square in the night on Sunday has also gone peacefully.
Most recently, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left him before the start of the curfew at 1 a.m.
The police had been on duty since the early evening with numerous officers, in the entire city area a larger police line-up could be seen.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, a ban on entering the Opera Square was in effect, on which riots had occurred a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.
At least five officers were injured, according to police inserts, with several police vehicles damaged.
The night of Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car flips over: Young woman seriously injured in accident on federal highway 83 at Hofgeismar
In an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at about 13:25.
She was taken to the Hospital Kassel.
With thermal cameras, the fire department was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was travelling on federal highway 83 in the direction of her place of residence Hümme, when her car came off the road for a previously unexplained cause and overturned several times.
In order to save the accident, the fire department had to cut the roof of the car free.
Since it was unclear whether there was still someone in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was searched from the turntable ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone squadron from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone between the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Nearly 50 firefighters from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The federal highway was closed for two hours because of the accident.
Juventus Turin champions in Italy
Turin - After a redemptive goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin have secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a row.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the total of 36. Scudetto in club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday night in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa perfect.
Ronaldo scored at 1:0 before halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is not to be displaced from first place two matchdays before the end of the season of Serie A.
Second-placed Inter Milan are seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless despite optical superiority in the first half, then Ronaldo scored after a free-kick variant with the final action.
A clearance from Miralem Pjanic exploited the 35-year-old from the penalty area boundary directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the now more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in the 2:0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the lacklustre but decisive success.
The foul penalty shot to the bar in the 89. Minute only Ronaldo himself should have been properly cared for with regard to the goal-scoring standings.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," coach Maurizio Sarri explained after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Above all, the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turin had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
The ultimately reassuring lead at the top of the standings was largely due to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before Sunday's game, the Sarri team had managed only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will also become the top scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund Ciro Immobile has already 34 goals on his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) of the table fourth Lazio Rome at the Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve professional Gonzalo Higuaín.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football awaits the next title chance.
Juventus are in the Champions League quarter-finals, must be on 7. August against Olympique Lyon, however, make up for a 0:1 first leg to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would be waiting as opponents.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races recorded
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, motorists continue to give gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-Württemberg roads: Last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
There are no comparative values for the years before, but the speeders are increasingly doing the judicial authorities: In the public prosecutor’s offices between Konstanz and Mannheim, a total of 155 investigative proceedings were conducted in 2018 for illegal races, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year to the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as can be seen from the Interior Ministry's response to a request from the state SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously competed against each other or they had taken the escape from the police - this is also indicated as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were at the wheel.
113 fines - 15 times jail
Only in comparatively few cases, the speeders are caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed since 2018 and 15 imprisonments have been issued.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the several tragic accidents and trials of previous years and indicated more often, a ministry spokesman said.
The Autobahn 8 is particularly popular with speeders. Again and again, motorists slow down the traffic there to get space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 near Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police even register more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between Engen and Geisingen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped-up sports and luxury bodies often have Swiss license plates, because the drivers dodge to Germany because of the high penalties for driving too fast and car racing in the neighboring country to the lawn.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometers per hour, we would create this problem on highways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to travel legally here and there with 200 kilometers per hour and more."
Rivoir thinks less of education or image campaigns: "Whoever overrides all rules in such a way and puts not only one's own life, but also the lives of other road users at risk, is hardly reachable with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
The ADAC, on the other hand, is not enough: "We assume that speeders cannot be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and the Environment at the ADAC Württemberg.
He is calling for additional and also tougher checks on the affected routes.
The high-speed struggle is not infrequently becoming more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people have died in the races nationwide, two of them in a nightly crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have delivered a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came off the road, bounced against a garden wall and was left lying on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
21 other people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "Legislatory action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more harshly is not seen," reads the Interior Ministry's paper.

Nuremberg: Unapproved tuning meeting - police intervene, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people took part in a "tuning meeting" in the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police implemented their announcement to increase control of such events.
For a big tuning meeting it is on Saturday night (25. July 2020) came in Nuremberg's Südstadt.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to police Middle Franconia, an increased volume of vehicles was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße around 22.30 clock.
As a result, the police carried out a large number of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to take increased action against so-called autoposers.
Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only small part from the "scene"
The officers counted to the top a good 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, the police said.
Of these, however, only a small part of those present can be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, the majority of the relevant scene complied with the appeal of the police.
On the basis of the vehicles and people on site, it can be assumed that these were predominantly onlookers.
In addition, the majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular compliance with the minimum distance and wearing of a mouth and nose protection.
The control measures carried out on site were over around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Middle Franconia Police Headquarters will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the advent of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, we must not scratch them," says Schrödinger.
Special tapes would be used for this.
Also, because the cars are wider, the company must take care not to cause damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of short-time work abuse
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time worker allowances.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," Daniel Terzenbach, the board member responsible for the operational business, told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper.
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, a large number of companies suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Usually, the exam takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us at this hot stage.
This is how we will take a closer look at the final statements.
There will certainly be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Evidence of abuse would often come from the affected employees or unions.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we prepare ourselves in the event of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money."
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 clock by the precinct drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation announced at PNN's request.
The young people left the park.
On Saturday night, some youngsters would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow had been cleared by precinct drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always accumulations where the distancing and hygiene rules of Covid-19 bypass regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June, there was a celebration with about 300 people in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without a coronavirus ordinance, the parks will be closed at nightfall.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to the parking regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for a long time that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, meanwhile, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party on Sunday night.
The event was dissolved by the police.

Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champions Manchester United return to the Champions League after a year's absence.
The Red Devils secured third place in the standings on the final day of the Premier League by a 2:0 (0:0) success against direct competitor Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League because Chelsea FC still passed by and qualified fourth for the premier class as well.
In the fight against relegation, Aston Villa were allowed to cheer.
Manchester United went through a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71. Minute) in the lead.
After a red card for Leicester City in the aftermath, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) scored to the final score.
Chelsea, Bayern's Champions League eighth-round opponents, won with 2:0 (2:0) against Wolverhampton Wanderers thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4).
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the final of the FA Cup against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton, who still passed the Wolves with a meagre 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and starts sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa won the long-distance duel with FC Watford and AFC Bournemouth, but had to tremble for a long time at West Ham United for class preservation.
The late lead of Jack Grealish (84.) immediately compensated Andrei Jarmolenko (85.).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost with 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which scuffed three coaches in the season, is descending after five first division years.
Just like Bournemouth, who could not save himself by a 3:1 (2:1) at Everton FC.
In the end, a point was missing.
Liverpool FC, who have been English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3:1 (1:1) victory at Newcastle United.
99 points is the highest level the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach Jürgen Klopp narrowly missed the points record in English football with his team.
Manchester City will hold the record with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
After the Newcastle lead in the first minute, Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) turned Sunday's game for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club, it was an extraordinary season," goal scorer van Dijk said after the game, "that should spur us to defend the title.
It will be hard."
In the end, the Premier League bosses are also likely to be satisfied.
Because of the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England were from the 13th. March to 17. June was interrupted.
In the meantime, there was even discussion about a premature cancellation or a performance of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, however, the season could be played to the end without any special incidents - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence during demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu's head of government are becoming increasingly violent.
There were violent clashes during the night.
Israeli police have violently cracked down on participants in a demonstration against right-wing conservative Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the night of Sunday in Jerusalem.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
Police deployed water cannon, among other things, to dissolve the rally.
In total, according to media reports, around 6000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's official headquarters on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The protesters beat drums, blew into horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration that supported Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site "ynet" reported.
Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the head of government's private mansion in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv because, according to police, is suspected of spraying pepper spray from a moving car on protesters by the side of the road.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protester was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption trial against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for its handling of the corona crisis.
Among other things, he is being held up to rash relaxations and a lack of preparation for a second wave of coronavirus.
The coronavirus crisis has severely affected the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent recently.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to new record levels.
Accident near Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter crashes on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - A rear-end collision claimed nine lightly injured on Saturday afternoon on the B58 at Ahlen.
A female driver was travelling with her two children (3, 5) in the direction of Beckum.
The police: "Probably she had suddenly slowed down because she wanted to turn off".
The driver of a Mercedes van who was driving behind her must have seen this too late.
He crashed on the back of the car.
In the accident, three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured.
Several ambulances took her to a surrounding hospital.
North Korea locks down border city after coronavirus suspect case
North Korea has so far seen a "luminous success" in its own measures to defend against the coronavirus.
Now, the country is reporting on a suspected case for the first time.
Because of a first official suspected case in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defenses in the past six months, "the malignant virus could have been introduced into the country," state media reported.
The state of emergency was imposed on the region around the border city of Kaesong.
The Communist leadership declared the highest alert level.
Should the suspected case be confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the isolated country.
North Korea has so far not registered a single infection, describing its defense measures as a "luminous success."
The information was questioned abroad.
The disease symptoms were reportedly detected in an "outlier" that occurred on the 19th. July illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea.
The person had deposed himself to South Korea three years ago and had now returned across the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
South Korea's military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports by the national news agency Yonhap.
There were investigations into some people.
North Korea called on Saturday on the suspected case an urgent meeting of the Politburo of the Workers' Party chaired by ruler Kim Jong Un.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive disaster."
Kim had already ordered on Friday as a preventive measure to "completely block Kaesong and isolate every district and the region from others," it said.
The person concerned, as well as all the people in Kaesong who had had contact with her, had been quarantined.
The party's central military commission is to investigate the "outliner's fall" as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh punishment.
About 300,000 people live in Kaesong, according to estimates.
Tension before Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still up for discussion before big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the development plan for the large-scale downtown development-east project," it says rather casually in the middle section of the municipal press release to the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28. July, at 16.30 in the Grand Hall of the CongressCentrum Pforzheim.
Above all, the upgrading of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
Majorities for this are scarce, most recently in individual committees, depending on the presence, even rejecting.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed out of the citizenry and then by the administration and the local council now not to let fail after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project opponent Reinhard Klein as "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unsuspecting", "speculation", "vilification" and "conscious false statements".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list to the local council for a year.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I'm talking about."
The exit comes the city cheaper, the technical town hall is contrary to statements of the city administration after grants, of the existence of which Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop very differently than one predicts in the city hall and on the part of the proponents from the economy.
To shape the city by its own strength and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED Group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the open keeping of the Schloßberg, the rental of the ex-thales for administrative areas and a more small-scale downtown redesign ideally with local sponsors.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the local council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution, caused by road traffic, including frequent speed reductions.
In a press release, the local Verkehrsclub Deutschland welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they have contributed to the massive increase in car traffic and thus noise by neglecting the scheduled bus traffic with thinned-out cycles and through little commitment to cycling, according to the VCD.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes accession to the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the municipal day-care facilities and the application for inclusion in the Smart City funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome but must heed coronavirus protection measures.
With much delay, Tim Zimmermann starts the new season
With almost half a year of delay, Tim Zimmermann starts on 31. July in his premiere season at the ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of supercars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first business trip in the new Lamborghini Huracan from Grasser Racing.
Under special hygiene conditions, this was now possible.
The 23-year-old Langenargener made his first laps at the Lausitzring and was able to get used to his premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different than the Porsche from the pre-season," Zimmermann says.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it was really a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman has been experienced in GT racing despite his only 25 years and has been able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other blindingly and we have also made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring".
Right there - at the Lausitzring - the GT Masters will also host its first race.
From 31. July the 33 supercars will race through the Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 newcomers to the series, knows the track.
In 2015 he was a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is, that turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams are playing poker a little bit during the tests," he says.
"In the end, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a densely packed calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
The current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, ex-Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will take part in the GT steering wheel.
UK transport minister caught cold by quarantine decision
The UK government's decision to quarantine Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold, according to press reports.
Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided on the measure at home on Saturday.
Because of the rising corona numbers in Spain, the cabinet in London removed the country from the list of those countries from which entry is possible without quarantine requirements.
The new regulation will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the scheme applies to those who are only just on the deadline, only from Saturday, the 1. August, and was not introduced overnight.
Spain, by the way, is considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria so far, for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers are likely to have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
“But apparently no one bothered to tell Grant Shapps.”
Almost a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the strict curfew, the infection numbers in the country are rising again.
Virologists mainly blame the nightlife for the new spread.
Spain is one of the British's favourite holiday countries.
The British government currently advises against non-essential travel to the Spanish mainland, the Canary Islands and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers, are exempt.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country an equipment of the warships with state-of-the-art hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the fighting possibilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the Central Marine Parade.
The Ministry of Defense also informed Interfax about successful tests of the zirconian hypersonic missile built for the navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of around 343 meters per second.
They are considered weapons of the future.
Underwater tropicaleo to continue construction
It will also be built on the nuclear-equipped underwater torpedo Poseidon, it said.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal destinations.
The president, who himself also rode a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service at the individual fleets of the world's largest country.
Russia has a coastal area like no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the navy has reliably protected Russia, Putin said at the day, which is celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal towns, the naval forces celebrated Navy Day with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside ruler Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired there.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense featured not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: Help difficult because of corona
Washington - This year's first hurricane over the Atlantic has come across land in Texas.
Life-threatening flooding, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center told the U.S. climate agency NOAA at night on Sunday (local time).
Gov. Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for numerous districts.
The coronavirus pandemic, which is rampant in Texas, is complicating the work of aid workers, Abbott said, according to US media.
Evacuated called for caution
"Every hurricane is an enormous challenge," Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle newspaper.
Addressing the Texas cyclone, he added: "This challenge is complicated and is exacerbated when you consider it sweeping through an area that is the state's area most affected by Covid-19."
According to data from Johns Hopkins University, around 5000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott called on people who would have to leave their homes to be cautious.
They should not disregard practices "to which we have become accustomed, such as wearing masks," the governor said, according to broadcaster CBS.
It is important that everyone keep their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, emergency shelters should be tested for corona.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal city of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" had hit land on the island of Padre Island immediately off the Texas coast, according to authorities.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to the hurricane of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had first been issued and later taken back again.
Authorities expected a slowdown, while "Hanna" moved further inland and headed for northeastern Mexico.
'Douglas' moves towards Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading toward Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it is said to be near the largest islands of Hawaii on Sunday (local time) - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Over the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average hurricane season this year, according to a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could become very strong cyclones, the agency had said.
On average, there are six hurricanes a year over the Atlantic, three of which are developing into storms of great strength.
In view of available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and the Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, that of a below-average even only ten percent, it said at the time.
US President Donald Trump wrote via Twitter that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals cancelled: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic were stripped of two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals cancelled: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a raven-black evening at the 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian Football League Serie A - and was really mad at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival of non-given gates for Sassuolo.
Never before has the VAR taken such a tough action against a team," commented the "Corriere dello Sport."
Host Naples was through a goal from outside-back Elseid Hisaj in the 8. Minute taken the lead, in the 32. Minute initially cheered Filip Djuricic on the equaliser.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back because of an offside position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball into the net again - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of attacker Francesco Caputo (50.) and Domenico Berardi (61.) also took back the refereeing team after clutting from the VAR.
In the post-match period, Allan made the 2:0 final score for Naples and the bitter evening perfect for Sassuolo.
"The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology is setting records," writes the Gazzetta dello Sport.
Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
Munich (dpa) - The start to the hot preparation phase for the Champions League began with a setback for double winner FC Bayern.
Hansi Flick, who recovered "somewhat well" after a short holiday and a few days of training, must already consider how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury to world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has the third most minutes of use behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfield boss Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury to his left footroot and threatens to be missing in crucial king-class duels.
In the Munich smuggling weather, the right-back broke off a training game and was driven off the course with a golf kart.
How long the unqualified regular player has to pause in the battle for the title is open to question.
A stake in the eighth-round return match against Chelsea on 8. August is likely to be difficult, to that on 12. The 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon in Lisbon.
Bayern do not want to be stopped by the mishap from training on Sunday.
Flick, in his personal triple formula, cited the three attributes he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal's capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be his victory-hungry title collectors in the ideally following 28 days until the king class final on 23. Show August.
"We have mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup simply excellent.
Now it's time to create the special," Flick said.
Until the Munich can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, but first the eighth final obligation against Chelsea is pending.
After the 3:0 in the first leg before the Corona break, the Londoners should not become a Bayern nightmare again in the domestic arena as in the lost "Finale dahoam" 2012.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and refuel confidence with a good game," Flick demanded.
A test to get your tune is on Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, to a once-in-a-lifetime August.
He welcomed 31 players to Säbener Straße, including the new players around noble shopping Leroy Sané, who met all new colleagues on the pitch for the first time after his move from Manchester City.
"Leroy, like all the newcomers, has blended in well," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. are no longer only allowed to train, Flick much prefers to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small group training, team strength is now being trained for the Londoners, who are in the rhythm of the game in contrast to the flick ensemble.
After that, the Munich could face a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A path to the final in Lisbon "is not quite so easy," stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The World Cup record goalscorer Klose and Flick know of many joint tournament preparation, what is particularly important in the 0 to 100 attunement.
With his current team, working is "a pleasure," Flick praised.
The "focusedness on winnings" was an impressive trait of his team.
The tournament with nine-team teams was also ambitious on Sunday.
Of the top performers, everyone was there, including the churning Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose whereabouts are not secured beyond the premier class season.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to crown its world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Championship titles.
All races in America have been cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The racing calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, it will be at the Nürburgring in Germany and in Portimão, Portugal.
On the first of November, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points on the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
As a result, the 2020 racing calendar currently comprises 13 runs.
"We are delighted that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season," Formula One boss Chase Carey said.
A total of 15 to 18 races in the premier class of motorsport are to be completed in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to conclude its season in Asia.
The final racing calendar is to be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, appearances in Vietnam and Malaysia could still take place at the end of November.
Regulations call for races on three continents
The regulations of Formula 1 require for the awarding of the World Championship but at least races on three continents.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are driven, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles, citing "exceptional circumstances" because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled at short notice due to the impending coronavirus crisis.
A return to the continent later this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Cancellation faces criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense coronavirus situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the US, Mexico and Brazil.
"We look forward to being back with them next season," Carey explained.
The cancellation of the Americas races met with criticism, especially in Brazil: "The cancellation came as no surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for this," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in São Paulo.
For example, the number of infections in the São Paulo area is significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to drive in Brazil would also not justify a rejection.
We are prepared for the required safety measures.
Greta Thunberg: Bad look against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her encounter with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest on Stephen Colbert's well-known late-night show via video switch and revealed in the interview what she had in mind during her encounter with Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular US latenight show via video switch.
She told, among other things, of her fight against the world's powerful.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "bad look" during her encounter with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now, in a well-known late-night show, she spoke about her plans in the future, as well as her encounter with US President Donald Trump at last year's UN climate summit.
Latenight host Stephen Colbert greeted 17-year-old Thunberg on Tuesday in your broadcast, leading a lengthy interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to shift the focus away from the climate crisis," she said.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children is taking to the streets," she said.
Heads of state and leaders who scoff against her on social media or even try to silence her find her "funny" as the reactions show her "since they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview, when Greta Thunberg was approached about a well-known scene in which she cast a bitterly evil look after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the activist sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image, which ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at the moment?
To Stephen Colbert's relatively open question, she replied only briefly un dryly: "To be honest, I don't think that needs any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert had probably not expected the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture with a laugh.
With her "How dare you?" speech about the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Real Estate with three-pack for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now on par with Bayern's Robert Lewandowski in the race for Europe's Golden Shoe.
Former Dortmund forward Ciro Immobile continues to have the best chance of becoming the top scorer in the Italian football championship.
The one-time BVB professional contributed three goals in Lazio Rome's 5:1 (1:1) victory at Hellas Verona, including two converted penalties in the post-match times of both halves.

Fleetwood Mac co-founder Peter Green has died
His life was like a roller coaster ride: after a fast-paced climb with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly back up again.
Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, another statement would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians like Peter Frampton paid tribute to Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood, in an emotional reaction, spoke of a "monumental loss" for all past and present members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now long legendary band in London in 1967, to this day his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game," "In The Skies") resembled a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - but the band celebrated their greatest successes without him.
There is said to have been disputes, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all the group's profits to charity.
He began to perform in wide robes and with great crucifix.
Mental health problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years after its foundation, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social descent.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, according to biographers.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street at times, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in the Bethnal Green district of London.
From a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be on stage as a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later, he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton at the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 along with his bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its downsides: Green could not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in my life is the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit."
Towards the end of the decade, Green surprisingly achieved a success of respect in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, swam on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite various small solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he relaunched in 1996 with a group of musicians who were friends.
The British Daily Telegraph spoke of a rock star who had returned to Earth.
Free of drugs, Green released some albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend during his lifetime - and with his soft sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
