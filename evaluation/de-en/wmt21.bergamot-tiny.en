Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 harvesters infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming in Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are quarantined and are no longer allowed to leave the farm.
A security service monitors the ban on leaving.
A total of 174 harvest workers were tested positively for the corona generator Sars-CoV-2 during the series survey, as the Dingolfing-Landau district office announced on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said District Councillor Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already become infected in the company - this was the reason for the row test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm that grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and beetroot - but the cucumbers only for inlay jars.
Mamming is a rural community with a good 3,300 inhabitants not far from Dingolfing with its large BMW factory.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to keep calm: "Our information is a closed group of people".
On the yard, infected by uninfected employees were separated, the site is now surrounded by a shut fence.
The Green and SPD gave the state government joint responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus Söder (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting the control of seasonal workers' accommodation.
"This can be taken in bitterly if such local infection events have to be arranged and regional lockdowns have to be arranged," said Jürgen Mistol, the parliamentary manager of the Greens.
The SPD is looking very similar: "After the Corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof slaughterhouse in mid-May, we have already called for a special inspection programme for farms with harvest helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"In our view, hygiene conditions at the workplace and housing conditions must be sharply monitored in our view.
This obviously did not happen."
The eruption had come "with an announcement".

Report: Seehofer pushes for longer data retention
Data retention is currently exposed.
However, according to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer is calling for an extension of the storage period.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
According to a media report, Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) is calling for an extended data retention - instead of the planned ten weeks, six months.
As reported by the "Bild am Sonntag", Seehofer Minister of Justice Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked for a quick change in the law in a letter.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen the measures against child abuse.
He considers it useful to "make urgently necessary adjustments in the law already," the newspaper quotes from the letter.
Currently, data retention is suspended.
A decision of the ECJ is expected to do so.
Seehofer, however, wants the amendments beforehand, so that they could be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Justice told the newspaper that it could only be sensibly examined whether legal adjustments are needed if the courts had decided.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the federal states, had already spoken out in June for data retention.
NBA: Stripclub annoyance for Clippers star Lou Williams
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams (33), Los Angeles Clippers basketball professional, is said to have left the tournament quarter in Disney World in Orlando, Florida, with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is said to have admitted the visit according to ESPN information, is back in isolation, is killed on COVID-19 every day.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for these very ings.
The American wrote: "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, note. R.) have the best things in the city".
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that NBA Williams has imposed a ten-day quarantine.
The Clippers star thus misses the first two official games after the fitness game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to play the corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams are preparing for the season final beginning at night on Friday.
Söder expresses his views on the Corona situation after Mass Infection
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test offensive for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be shown live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the district of Dingolfing-Landau has startled authorities and politicians.
Nearly 500 harvest workers from several countries currently work on the large vegetable farm, and more than a third has become infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed off with a construction fence.
No one may leave the site, food will be delivered.
The authorities now offer free Corona tests to the community's population.
Since the harvest workers had little contact with the local population, the district council's office has so far aseded that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Civilties": Confession of the presumed arsonist of Nantes
"My client has shown himself to be cooperative," said lawyer Quentin Chabert of the newspaper.
The defence lawyer added, "He very regrets the acts, the confession was a liberation for him."
His mandate was "torn of conscience and very helpful to the extent of the destruction."
In the event of a conviction, according to the public prosecutor, the man faces ten years of imprisonment and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been severely damaged in the night of Saturday last week in a fire.
The fire had broken out in three places far from each other in the church.
Laboratory tests confirmed the suspicion of arson.
The suspect who was now detained was arrested a few hours after the fire.
He was released after one day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closing of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
Since there was no trace for a violent penetration into the church, he quickly came into the field of view of the investigators.
Discussing the Abolition of the 50+1 Rule
Former DFB President Reinhard Grindel has recommended thinking about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
"German football should at least discuss conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates a fait accompli," said Grindel of the "Bild am Sonntag".
He emphasised: "The 50+1 rules do not work for the associations that can become most dangerous for Bayern and Dortmund: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot avoid the debate as to whether it is not necessary to facilitate the involvement of investors associations that want to break down into this phalanx."
However, he had doubts as to whether there is a willingness in the German Football League to allow majority participations that are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"There remains a legal risk of pulling investment fences around the business location for the Bundesliga as a business in a European internal market," said Grindel.
The former DFB leader sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competition balance in the Bundesliga will in the end only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level, but will not lead to more tension in the championship."
Even a equal allocation of TV funds will not achieve a decisive effect.
"The FC Bayern generates a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million and RB Leipzig of 300 million.
The differences are therefore already immense among the first three clubs alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average household of 130 million," explained the 58-year-old.
With a view to the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
"Unfortunately, there have been people who noticed this mistake and pierced it to the press instead of addressing me," said Grindel about the assumption of an expensive clock that led to his resignation in April 2019.
"I was very busy humanly."
He received the gift worth around 11,000 euros from a Ukrainian official.
"I committed a compliance violation and it was right to draw the consequences," said Grindel.
"I dealt with the ominous watch gift completely transparent and innocent.
After all, many in the DFB knew about it."
He had never "handed out of the gift" assured the 58-year-old.
"This may be called naive, at least this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption."
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and a Dead
The protests against police violence in the United States have intensified again through Donald Trump's efforts by federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, there were clashes between demonstrators and police in various cities.
Three people were injured in Louisville and 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by shots while a demonstration was crossing a crossroads.
Previously, there had been clashes in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officials, used tear gas in the night of Saturday and forced apart demonstrators.
Hundreds, sometimes armed demonstrators marched through Louisville in Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for the death of Breonna Taylor be held responsible.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in March at a drug raid in her apartment in Louisville.
The goal of the raid was someone else who did not live there at all, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group, which calls himself an armed alliance of black Americans, a shot was fired on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them was in danger of life.
The police set up barricades because they had formed counter-wirstrants of a white militia.
In the end, there was no coincidence of the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot dead in a "Black Lives Matter" demonstration and died.
According to the police, the police detained a suspect.

Demonstrators also crashed into the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday on Saturday.
They set fire in front of a youth prison construction car, the police used glare grenades and pepper spray.
According to the "Seattle Times," 16 people were arrested for resisting police or assault.

A small group of demonstrators had hit windows, shot fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, the police told Oakland late Saturday evening (local time).
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd that demonstrated on a highway.
As the police told, one of the demonstrators fired a weapon and at least one person was taken to the hospital injured.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was laid, as the police told.
Investigations were included.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historic costumes defy Corona
Although the large sweepside in the spa town was missing, visitors and performers enjoyed the rakoczy flair of the alternative program.
It was unfamiliar to visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy Weekend without Rakoczy Festival.
But even if the big party mile in the city centre was missing, the crowds and programme highlights such as Saale are burning, Rakoczy Ball or the strip, many of them came to their money's worth with the Corona-compliant alternative programme.
"I think we managed to spread Rakoczy flair," says Curish Director Sylvie Thormann.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one returns to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, as well as the historical focuses on the festival.
Pleasant atmosphere
Vesna Konhäuser and her husband have been visiting Bad Kissingen for more than 25 years.
So this time in the Corona year.
The couple made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold Casino, watches the historical streaks and listens to Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
"I think it's so pleasant," says Konhäuser.
She does not miss the crowds that do not otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
However, it lacks the usual programme highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic procession and the final fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's a pity.
The weather would have been a great fit this year," she says.
Rakoczy Riding Tournament to take place again
For the actors of the historical spa guests, the alternative program meant some more work.
For example, for Christina Gold, who will take part in the procession in a normal year and can be seen there on the carriage of the Kurgartencafé.
This year she was traveling in the city on foot on Saturdays and Sundays in costumes.
"That's more exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual riders were on the road in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille will be allowed to take place again next year," says the chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that a Rakoczy riding tournament will take place again after several years of break in 2021.

Argentina rejects creditors' reply
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economic Affairs announced in Buenos Aires on Saturday.
"That would be irresponsible not only, but also unjust," said a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debt of the second largest economy in South America is no longer sustainable under current conditions.
That is why Argentina is demanding that its private creditors waive some of their claims of around 66 billion US dollars (around 59 billion euros).
If there is no agreement, the country is once again threatened with the state bankruptcy.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.

The inflation rate was recently more than 50 percent.
Experts expect economic strength to decline by around ten percent for the current year.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid US dollars interest oncomes of 503 million dollars, thereby slipping into limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet private
"It's going super good" - this conclusion is drawn by Dr. Stefanie Kramer after her first few days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
At the end everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learns that she will succeed Lutz Feller in the Eggenfelden notarial office.
Six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the lawyer who holds a doctorate up and took up thesis, and the normal day-to-day business has long been in full speed.
"However, I have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottal indicator and laughs.
Of course, the short lead time was not enough to shift the centre of life from Regensburg to Eggenfelden, reports the native of Dingol.
Currently, she is looking for a suitable apartment or a house in the city with her husband, who works in Regensburg as a judge at the district court.
At least her husband was able to apply for parental leave at short notice in order to ensure the care of the two daughters (31⁄2 and 11⁄2 years old).
In order not to have to commute from Regensburg every day, she also had an overnight stay with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has long been known to it.
During visits on site with her family in recent months, she has then again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
She was all the more pleased that she had done the race in the selection process for the vacancy.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer's professional career plays a central role in her hometown of Lower Bavaria: After studying law in Passau, she performed her legal traineeship and the 2nd edition. State examination in Regensburg.
After several positions as a notary assessor, among others in Rehau and Hof in Upper Franconia, Babenhausen in the Unterallgäu and Regensburg - during this time she shouldered the doctorate in labour law "by the way" - she took her first place as a notary's notary in Rotthalmünster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016, she went on parental leave, followed by the move to Regensburg.
Since then she has taken over representation services in various notary offices.
When the position in Eggenfelden was advertised because of Lutz Feller's approach, she had seen the right time for full returning to work, explains the 39-year-old.
The team of their predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary in the notary, have held Dr. Stefanie Kramer took over - and has immediately praised the team of the law firm: "It's going super good!"
The fact that she can rely on well-established processes makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
She has already made contact with a local institution in terms of kindergarten or crib sites.
And everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to pursue her hobby here soon - and get to know the most beautiful jogging tracks of the Rottal.
BVB plans to launch the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The biggest German football stadium in Dortmund will not even be 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.

The cramer responsible for marketing, digitisation and internationalisation at BVB hopes that, in addition to the normal spectator seats, some of the approximately 4,000 seats in the hospitality area can also be opened: "It is of course a slap into the Kontor if these revenues break away completely".
In view of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "good advised to take a stable page first".
"If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need is limited to entertainment," explained Cramer.
The Dortmund marketing boss praised the BVB professionals for their salary partial renunciation, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their salary renunciation has a different effect than when we put 100 people working in merchandising."

They are born so small and so early that neither lungs, nor intestines, nor muscles are fully developed.
Their skin is sometimes so delicate that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll's clothes and mini diapers specially made for them.
But not so small that they weren't at voice - "and how," shouts Berndt Urlesberger smiling.
"Even if of course they don't scream as loudly as big babies."

"If we continue to improve the technical framework, it could be an interesting addition to the game," director Winfried Tobias stressed.

In 1946 she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film was screened in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award came as the best actress in William Wyler's "The Heiress" (The Heiress).
She was also paid a lot of recognition as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Snake Pit".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the leading role in the film adaptation of her novel "My Cousine Rachel".
The piece was a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis she played in "Wiegenlied for a corpse".

This marriage also broke up.
However, rumors about an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath were never confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler misses finale at comeback
The World Championship runner-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in Düsseldorf, they were defeated by their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Flüggen in the semifinals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Most recently, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome in September last year.
In the final match on the Rhine, their conqueror Ehlers/Flüggen crashed against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21) a defeat.
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: The tickets secured Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peemüller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
Kalbitz ejection from AfD confirmed - FDP speaks of "Figsblatt"
From the point of view of the FDP, the exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is only a "fig leaf" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the right-wing extremists in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said the FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The AfD Federal Arbitration Court in Stuttgart confirmed on Saturday on Saturday, after several hours of hearing, the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the federal executive board had decided to take part in the May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD parliamentary group in the Brandenburg state parliament.
"If the AfD were really concerned with consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials such as Björn Höcke and his supporters would have long been banned," said Strasser.
"However, there is no political will in the AfD, because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
Similarly, CSU general secretary Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded says nothing and does not change anything," he told "World on Sunday".
"It speaks rather volumes how many frenetic supporters still have a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD."
Blume assumes that the AfD will once again end up in elections below five percent.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD state and parliamentary group chairman Björn Höcke; the secret service classifies the purse as a "protected right-wing extremist effort".
In May, the AfD federal board member Kalbitz had cast out of the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not stated a former membership in the now banned far-right "homerooted German Youth" (HDJ) and the Republican Republicans.
Kalbitz contests the membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left-wing faction in the Brandenburg state parliament, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a right-wing extremist party, whether with or without Kalbitz".
With this decision, neither the federal party will weaken nor the right wing.
"The manoeuvre of the Meuthen troupe is transparent.
They want to escape further observation through the secretary's protection and try to get through under the radar," said Walter.
"The AfD won't get rid of the ghosts she called.
A throw-out does not change there yet," commented Brandenburg's SPD general secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here, the AfD regional association and the faction held its right-wing leader to date".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz's membership in the AfD will continue.
On Saturday, he announced that he would now proceed against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court.
North Sea wind farms supply a good 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea fed 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity into the grid.
That is a good 21 percent more than in the same period last year, the network operator Tennet announced in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German electricity grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the grid area of Tennet, have fed in another 2,22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
Overall, the wind power from the North and Baltic Seas is coming to 13.73 TWh, compared to a good 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind power in Germany; that is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms ensure higher generation capacities
In addition to the wind conditions, the increased contribution of offshore wind energy results from higher generation capacities, because new wind farms have been connected to the grid over the past twelve months.
If the 1,270 wind power plants in the North Sea were all running at full speed at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient for this; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
By 2030, it is expected to rise to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea.
"In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing 20 billion euros in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then," said Tennet Managing Director Tim Meyerjürgens.
In reality, wind farms cannot exploit their capacity at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is the 2nd day. January, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This would allow almost seven million households to be supplied with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gmünder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130th.
Birthday of the Gmünder Kunstverein: The opening of the exhibition "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold blew up the usual setting after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usually pursued the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was provided by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on southern Kornhausplatz.
North of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the three-day festival planned for September.
In other years, over 30,000 people had attended this city festival.
"We have truly not made this decision easy and - consciously how difficult it is economically for those involved - have hoped until the last minute," said Lord Mayor Uwe Rumberg (party-less).
"But ultimately we are responsible for the health of many thousands of people here as the organiser."
If tens of thousands had flowed to the festival grounds and the marquee, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracking in accordance with the current Corona protection regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately many times over.
Rumberg roasted to next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with the Winterberg Festival from 7 to 9 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of Saxony from 10 to 12 May September 2021.
Dressage Olympic champion Werth in hangrs not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at four starts at the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix with Weihegold and Quantaz at the start, she was also unbeatable in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday and in the freestyle.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth clearly prevailed in the Special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
The Germans were also clearly in the freestyle on Saturday on Quantaz before her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz belongs to Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz it was the first freestyle ever.
At the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago, Werth had won all important four competitions.
The last of the three international tournaments is there for the 14th to 16th. August scheduled.
In the future more air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University continues to the air: The "DFS German Aviation Control" is sponsoring a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship, it is possible to enable the start of studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities are evenly utilised both in the university and at the air traffic control academy of the DFS.
DFS will advise the university on the establishment and staffing of the professorship.
Since 2019 represented at the university
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students have been in the Air Traffic Management course as part of their training as an air traffic controller at the University of Applied Sciences Worms.
This year, nine students have already started.
So far, the experience of DFS has been very positive, the achievements of the students are outstanding.
The combination of studies and pilot training makes a significant contribution to further increasing the attractiveness of the pilot occupation.
"In these times, promotion is not economically easy for us.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow in the long term.
In order to be able to fulfil our statutory mandate in the future, we need highly qualified personnel," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For DFS, the endowed professorship is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, cross-technical knowledge base in the long term.
We are therefore continuing the good cooperation with the university and at the same time underpin our attractiveness as an employer."
This is also underlined by Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences: "The endowed professorship is an important bridge between science and industry.
With it, we want to build on the existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practice partner for the dual bachelor's degree programme Air Traffic Management."
The trust of German air traffic control is both a motivation and an obligation for the University of Applied Sciences for the Worms University of Applied Sciences to further expand their teaching and research competence in the future fields of air transport.
In working for the air traffic controllers of tomorrow, the university and the first endowed chair for a dual course of study could set very special highlights and innovative focuses for their students.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary in the Ministry of Science, Continuing Education and Culture, emphasises: "With its focus on air transport, the University of Applied Sciences Worms has a unique selling point in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university."
Rescue horns lands on the A 45
The A 45 motorway was fully closed on Saturday afternoon towards Aschaffenburg, because the rescue helicopter was used after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old drove straight ahead with a Ford at 12.40 in the exit Alzenau-Mitte in the curve and landed at the guardrail.
The front airbags caused the impact, the driver suffered minor injuries in the face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were treated by the emergency doctor and the patient was then flown with the rescue helicopter to a hospital.
At present, however, the police assume that there is no danger to their lives.
The damaged vehicle, which caused damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed away.
Healing wants to examine other industries according to the meat industry
The corona crisis once again brought the conditions in parts of the meat industry to light.
Insightedness of the law is imminent.
But are they right - and will it stick to it?
Federal Labour Minister Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to review other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against grievances in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry when necessary," said Heil, the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany's employers are already warning against restricting contracts for work in general.
After the mass corona outbreak at the meat giant Tönnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ third-party personnel during slaughter, dismantling and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of work contract contractors and temporary workers is to be prohibited there.
Employer president Ingo Kramer said to the dpa: "Order away from a general restriction of work contracts and temporary workers if you do not want to completely strangle the economy."
For example, contracts for work contracts are the basis for their value creation at the customer's site, for example, for large areas of trade, the construction industry and the plant industry.
"The mistakes of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument."
Salvation assured: "My goal is not to ban contracts for work throughout the German economy."
Work contracts are useful.
"If an industrial company commissions a tradesman to install a security system, it is a normal contract for work."
The German meat industry considers a ban on contracts for work and temporary agency work to be unconstitutional in its industry alone.
It cannot be explained why portioning and packaging cheese should be subject to different labour law than sausage in the future, according to a statement on the proposal, as reported by the "Neue Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the case of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
After the results of an audit of the NRW occupational health and safety administration, many employees from work contract companies many people worked in the industry for 16 hours a day.
Often they did not have a break.
Contract was retained for protective or rental.
It was also noted that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Salvation said that a relatively sharp law had already come into force for the meat industry in 2017.
However, these were circumvented by "knit constructions".
"Now it is necessary to fundamentally clean up."
The politician announced: "In the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which we want to adopt in the cabinet at the end of July, measures that not only affect the meat industry - for example, higher test rates for occupational safety and health or clear criteria for Community accommodation are also measures."
The draft before the dpa includes amendments to the law to secure workers' rights in the meat industry and the Occupational Safety Act.
Brandenburg's Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive checks to be necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do even more checks in many supervisory areas: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example, animal transport," said Nonnemacher on Sunday in the RBB programme "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing are also needed for more inspections.
Three dead in the crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people have died in the event of a microlight aircraft on an apartment building in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
One child was slightly injured.
Two other people were saved injured in the accident, said a spokesman for the Wesel district control center.
According to the police, a parachute was found at the scene of the accident.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that the plane had collided with a hot air balloon before the crash.
The house is a single or two-family house.
Further details were not known at first.
Clearance of Frankfurt Opera Square peacefully
One week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of Opernplatz was peaceful during the night of Sunday.
Finally, a few dozen people were still in the square, but left him at 1 o'clock before the start of the curfew.
The police have been deployed since the early evening with numerous officers, and a larger police station was seen throughout the city.
For the first time this weekend, from midnight, a ban on entry to the Opera Square, on which riots took place a week ago.
Police were attacked with bottles from the crowd of revelers.

The night of Saturday had also remained quiet.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstraße 83 at Hofgeismar
In the event of an accident between Schöneberg and Hümme, a 21-year-old suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 1.25 p.m.
She was transferred to the Kassel Hospital.
With thermal cameras, the fire brigade was looking for potential passengers.
According to the police, the woman was on the main road 83 towards her hometown of Hümme, when her car departed from the road from the previously unknown cause and overturned several times.
In order to save the accident, the fire brigade had to cut the roof of the car.
Since it was unclear whether there was still someone in the vehicle, the adjacent maize field was searched by the turning ladder with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone shunting from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, was also ordered for the search for people.
However, the emergency services did not find anyone between the high corn plants.
The seriously injured was brought to the Kassel hospital for further care with the ambulance.
Almost 50 emergency services from the Hofgeismar, Hümme and Schöneberg fire brigade were on site.
The federal road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Championships in Italy
Turin - After a redeeming goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world-football player made the 36th. Scudetto of the club's history with a 2:0 (1:0) perfect on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 before the half.
With 83 points, Turin, which competed without the long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer alien to two days before the end of the season of Serie A.
The second table in Inter Milan is seven points behind.
Despite optical superiority in the first half, Juventus was harmless, then Ronaldo met with the last action after a free kick variant.
A play by Miralem Pjanic was used by the 35-year-old from the penalty limit directly with a flat shot (45.+7).
Against the more offensive guests, Ronaldo was also involved in 2-0, after his shot Federico Bernardeschi (67th) dusted off.
This ensured the lackluster, yet decisive success.
The foul eleven meter shot at the bar in the 89th. Minute should have had only had read correctly to Ronaldo himself with a view of the goal scorer.
"It's complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball height for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and momentum changes very easily," explained coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players is great, said the Juve-Coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve had recently owed its reassuring advantage at the top of the standings to the weakness of the competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only achieved five victories.
Whether Ronaldo will also become a goal scorer is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmund-based Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 hits on his account after his pack of three at the 5:1 (1:1) of the table-fourth Lazio Rome at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve-Profi Gonzalo HiguaÃ3n.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for the SSC Naples in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "old lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next chance.
Juventus is in the round of 16 in the Champions League, has to win 7. August vs Olympique Lyon, however, make up for a 0:1 listening string to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next knockout round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as an opponent.
Baden-Württemberg: Over 250 illegal car races hit
Stuttgart - Despite all threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to accelerate during countless illegal races on the streets of Baden-Württemberg: last year and the first four months of this year, the police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparative values for the years before, the racers are increasingly doing work to the judicial authorities: A total of 155 investigations were conducted for illegal races in the public prosecutors' offices between Constance and Mannheim in 2018, a year later, there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June.
The races were less interested in organized events, as can be seen from the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the state parliament SPD.
In most cases, the drivers had spontaneously competed against each other or they have seized the flight from the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly at the wheel.
113 Fines - 15 times detention
Only in comparatively few cases are the racers caught and also asked to pay: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines have been imposed and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there is no evidence that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other motorists reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years and reported more often, said a ministry spokesman.
The motorway 8 is particularly popular with racers. Time and again, drivers stop the traffic there in order to secure space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen riders were caught near Kirchheim unter Teck, and three months earlier there were even 18 riders on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to slow down the speeders on the particularly affected section between narrowing and Geisringen.
The mostly high-priced and pimped up sports and luxury cars often have Swiss license plates because the drivers avoid Germany because of the high penalties for too fast driving and car races in the neighbouring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 kilometres per hour, we would create this problem on motorways off our way," says Martin Rivoir, the traffic expert of the SPD parliamentary group.
"The inhibition threshold for speeders would be significantly higher if you were not allowed to be legally on the road here and there with 200 kilometres per hour."
Rivoir thinks fewer about education or image campaigns: "Anyone who disregards all rules in such a way and not only plays his own life, but also the lives of other road users is hardly reachable with reason."
ADAC calls for stronger police crackdown
The ADAC, on the other hand, is not enough: "We assume that racers cannot be deterred by the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC Württemberg.
It calls for additional and also tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-speed trial of strength to become more painful and serious: Since January 2019 and April 2020, three people have died in the countryside in the country, two of them in a nightly crash in Stuttgart's city centre and one in Gerlingen.
Two young men are said to have raced a car race there in November.
One of the vehicles came from the road, bounced against a garden wall and remained on the side of the 18-year-old passenger.
Another 21 people were injured in the races of the past two years.
However, according to Minister of the Interior, Thomas Strobl, does not necessarily necessarily have to impose more sharp penalties: "The legislature of action to sanction illegal motor vehicle races more difficult," the paper by the Ministry of the Interior says.

Ackermann sprints to win on the final stage at Sibiu Tour
Jerkers Pascal Ackermann has held the 10th stage on the final stage of the 10th stage Sibiu Tour achieved his second victory of the day.
The 26-year-old Palatinate of the Bora-hansgrohe team prevailed over the 109-kilometre section with the start and finish in Hermannstadt in a mass sprint, after he had already won a stage on Saturday.
They were the season victories three and four for Ackermann.

"The sprint was really hectic," said the 26-year-old.
300 metres to go, he simply dressed his sprint, "and it worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the world association UCI, a Corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all race participants and their companions.
During the entire tour, drivers and supervisors in isolated hygiene bubbles were separated from the organisation team and from the media.
Spectators at the start and finish were not allowed.

Nuremberg: Unauthorised tuning meeting - Police intervenes, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and over 1000 people took part in a "Tuning meeting" on the parking lot of a furniture store on Saturday night.
The police spent their announcement of increasing control of such events.
To a big tuning meeting it is on Saturday evening (25. July 2020) in Nuremberg's southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the police middle francs, an increased volume of vehicles in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolstädter Straße was detected at around 10.30 p.m. by the Nuremberg traffic police force.

Illegal tuning meeting in Nuremberg: Only a small part of the "scene"
The officers ranked 700 vehicles at the top and around 1100 people, the police registered.
However, only a small part of the present should be assigned to the "Autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene complied with the police's appeal.
Based on the vehicles and people on site, it was to be assumed that these were mainly on the looking.
In addition, the majority of those present held to the applicable infection protection regulations, in particular observing the minimum distance and wearing a mouth-wet protection.
The local control measures were completed around 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officers found such structural changes in 10 vehicles that the operating license had spent lapses.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car racing
There was no illegal car racing.
"The Central Franconia Police Department will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out increased control measures, including in connection with the advent of onlookers," it said.
The agency News5 spoke with Jürgen Schrödinger of the towing company involved: "They all have beautiful rims, they must not be scratched," says Schrödinger.
Special bands would be used for this.
Also because the cars are wider, the company must be careful not to make damage.
"After all, the young people should get their cars back unscathed."
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in short-time work
Berlin - The Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short worker money.
"This is extremely little for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, member of the Executive Board responsible for the operations, Daniel Terzenbach of the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung".
When, at the beginning of the corona crisis, a very large number of companies had suddenly applied for short-time work, the BA had to react quickly.
Normally, the exam lasts up to three weeks.
"We didn't have that much time in this hot phase.
We will take a closer look at the final bills.
It will certainly be a lot more after.
We are not naive there and have a long breath."
References to abuse often come from the employees or trade unions concerned.
In addition, the BA uses analysis software to detect abuse patterns.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible wave of insolvency in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more insolvencies than in the previous year?
The assessments differ, but we are preparing ourselves in the event of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for the handling of applications for insolvency money."
The figures are still inconspicuous, said Terzenbach.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party in the New Garden dissolved
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG) at 8.48 p.m., the foundation announced on PNN request.
The young people had left the park.
On Saturday evening, some teenagers would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by hunting drivers, said SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee on Sunday.
Again and again there are illegal celebrations in the parks
In the parks of the foundation, there are always collections in which the distance and hygiene rules Covid-19 translation regulation are not complied with.
At the end of June, there was a celebration of about 300 people in the Babelsberg Park, and a week later, about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without corona decree, the parks are closed at nightfall.
Camping in the meadows is prohibited according to the park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The foundation has been complaining for some time that visitors will leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neukölln, 5000 people celebrated an illegal techno party during the night of Sunday.
The event was disbanded by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after Corona outbreak in tourist town
With hundreds of tests, authorities have found a corona outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang reacted.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, as reported by the state authorities in Linz.

Arrests and Violence at Demonstrations Against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Prime Minister Netanyahu are becoming more and more violent.
Violent clashes occurred during the night.
The Israeli police took violent action during the night of Sunday in Jerusalem against a demonstration against right-wing conservative head of government, Benjamin Netanyahu.
Twelve people were arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told.
The police used, among other things, to use water cannons to dissolve the rally.
According to media reports, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu's headquarters on Saturday evening.
They protested against unemployment, corruption, and Netanyahu's dealing with the coronavirus crisis.
The protesters beat drumming, blew in horns and called on Netanyahu to resign.
Participants in a counter-demonstration were also arrested, which Netanyahu supported, reported the news page "ynet".
In many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
According to police reports, a man was arrested near Tel Aviv because it is suspected of having sprayed pepper spray on protesters on the roadside from a moving car.
Another man was arrested after a stabbing attack on a demonstrator in the south of the country.
The protester had been slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv there have recently been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The rallies accompany the corruption process against the head of government.
Most recently, Netanyahu was also criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is held premature atonement and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The corona crisis has hit the country's economy.
The unemployment rate was recently more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to ever new records.

North Korea shuts off border town after corona suspicion case
So far, North Korea has viewed its own measures to defend against the coronavirus "shining success."
Now the country is reporting for the first time about a suspected case.
Due to a first official corona suspicion in the country, North Korea has completely sealed off a big city for fear of a disaster.
Despite the strictest epidemiological defense measures in the past six months, "the malicious virus could have been introduced into the country," reported the state media.
The emergency has been imposed on the region around the border town of Kaesong.
The communist leadership called the highest alert level.
If the suspected case is confirmed, it would be the first official case of infection with Sars-CoV-2 in the closed country.
So far, North Korea had not registered a single infection and described its defensive measures as "luminous success".
The information was doubted abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "outlier" who was found on the 19th century. July illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea.
The person had moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned to the border.
There was initially no confirmation from South Korea for crossing the border within the four-kilometre-wide and largely still mined military buffer zone.
According to reports by the Yonhap national news agency, however, South Korea's military considered the possibility of illegal border crossing to North Korea as high.
Investigations were carried out to some people.
According to North Korea, it was suspiciously calling an emergency meeting of the Labour Party's Politburo, chaired by members of Mr Kim Jong Un, on Saturday.
The "dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe."
Kim had already ordered "Kesong to completely block Kaseong on Friday and isolate every district and the region of others," it continued.
The person concerned and all people in Kaesong who had had contact with him were quarantined.
The central military commission of the party is therefore to investigate the "outer trap" as well as the behaviour of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose a hard punishment.
It is estimated that there are about 300,000 people living in Kaesong.
Excussions before Council meeting: City East and noise protection are still facing a big summer break
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote, among other things, on the development plan for the large-scale project on the city-East," says rather casually in the middle section of the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, 28. July, at 4.30 pm in the Great Hall of the Congress Centre Pforzheim.
Above all, the enhancement of the eastern city is controversial until the end.
The majorities in favour are scarce, most recently in individual committees, even negatively depending on their presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT), the project developed from the citizenship and then by administration and then by administration and the municipal council not to fail now after almost ten years of preparation, criticized project leader Reinhard Klein as an "extra-parliamentary opposition", "unexpected", "scung", "svilification" and "conscious false statements".
"All think it would be better to know," says Klein, who has been the only representative of the Pforzheim citizen list to be a year old.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he is in this position: "I know what I am talking about".
The city is cheaper, the city is cheaper, contrary to statements by the city administration, according to grants whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than in the town hall and by the supporters of the economy.
Shaping the city by its own strength and not an investor: that is his plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED fraction, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also provides for the renovation of the Technical Town Hall, the open provision of the Schloßberg, the rental of the Ex-Thales for administrative space and a more small-scale city centre redesign ideally with local porters.
Environmental issues play a key role
In addition, environmental issues will play a central role.
Among other things, the municipal council will vote on the noise action plan.
This includes various measures to protect the population of Pforzheim from noise health pollution caused by road traffic, including many speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this must happen because they only contribute to the massive increase in car traffic and thus of noise, by neglecting regular bus service with thinned cycle bars and through little commitment to cycling traffic, the VCD said.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda is included in joining the Climate Protection Pact of the State of Baden-Württemberg, the re-establishment of parental contributions in the municipal day of children's day-care centres and the application for admission to the federal government's smart city funding.
Citizens are welcome, but coronation measures must take consideration.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With almost six months of delay, Tim Zimmermann will start on 31. July in its premiere season in the ADAC GT Masters.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now scheduled.
For Zimmermann, it was mainly about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3 better.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from tackling his first race in the new Lamborghini Huracan of Grasser Racing.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargener turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and was able to get used to its premiere in the GT3 car.
"There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the previous season," says Zimmermann.
"With the ABS, for example, you have to go into the corners differently.
But it really was a lot of fun."
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
Despite its only 25 years, the Dutchman has already experienced in GT racing and was able to help his new team-mate in many things.
"I'm not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series also brings new challenges," says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I get along dazzlingly and we have made enormous progress from session to session at the Lausitzring."
This is exactly where the GT Masters will be closing its first race at the Lausitzring.
From the 31. The 33 super sports cars will race through Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series newcomers, knows the route.
In 2015 he was most recently a guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get low on the track," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Graf Zeppelin racing community in Friedrichshafen.
"The Lausitzring has many fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How quickly carpenter really is then turn out to be in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams pose a little bit during the tests," he says.
"In the end, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring."
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a crowded calendar.
Seven races are scheduled until the beginning of November.
Current stand is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the Nürburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko Hülkenberg will pick up into the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister of Transport Cold Caught Downship
According to press reports, the British government's decision to quarantine for Spain holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country's transport minister cold.
According to the latter, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, of all places, while his colleagues decided to take the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the corona figures in Spain, the cabinet in London cancelled the country from the list of countries from which entry without quarantine requirements is possible.
The new scheme will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to come to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures for returnees.
But the regulation applies to those who are only on the deadline of leave, only from Saturday, the 1st day. August, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain has so far been considered one of the "safe countries" in Austria for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers may have known in advance that there is a possibility of a quarantine being imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," commented Labour MP Diane Abbot.
"But obviously nobody has bothered to tell Grant Shapp's."
Less than a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiry of the severe curfew, the number of infections in the country will rise again.
Viomers in particular blame nightlife for the renewed spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday destinations of the British.
The British government is currently advising against unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland, which is particularly popular with British holidaymakers, the Canaries and the Balearic Islands are excluded.
To date, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.

Formula 1 needs a special rule to select its world champion
Since the required number of continents cannot be driven, the FIA needs to improvise in order to award the World Championship title.
All America races were cancelled.
Race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
In addition to the ten confirmed Grand Prix so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.

The concerns of some teams not wanting to go to Brazil would not justify any cancellation.
We are prepared for the security measures required.
Greta Thunberg: Evil gaze against Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was a guest in Stephen Colbert's well-known latenight show via video switches and revealed in an interview what she had in her mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climateate officiary Greta Thunberg was a guest in a popular US Latenight show via video switching.
She talked, among other things, about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil eye" when she met Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has attracted attention with her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke in a well-known latenight show about her plans in the future and her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg in your show on Tuesday and conducted a longer interview with the Swede.
She spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the powerful of the world.
"There are some things that surprised me," she said.
"How far people go to shed away from the climate crisis were focusing," she shocked.
"Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of children takes to the streets," she experienced.
Heads of state and leaders who mock them in social media or even try to silence them find them "funny" because the reactions show her "because they have no other answer to it."
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was approached on a well-known scene in which she looked after US President Trump.
At the 2019 UN climate summit in New York, for which the actuator sailed across the Atlantic, she caught an expressive view of the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
The short clip resulted in a GIF, an animated image that ultimately became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think about the US president at that moment?
To the relatively open question put by Stephen Colbert, she answered only briefly and dryly: "To be honest, I believe that does not require any further explanation."
The experienced satirist Colbert probably did not expect the quick-witted answer and disappeared from the picture briefly laughing.
With her "Howe you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she remained in many memories at the climate conference.

Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green died
His life was like a rollercoaster ride: after a rapid ascent with Fleetwood Mac, it went steeply downhill and then slowly up again.
Now the blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Ingenious guitarist, drug junkie, cult supporter: The co-founder of the band Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, and members told family members in an official statement on Saturday, and another opinion would be announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton honored Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional reaction of a "monumental loss" for all previous and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the long-time legendary band in London in 1967, and his dreamy instrumental hit "Albatros" is still unforgettable today.
The musician's life ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") resembled a rollercoaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without it.
There is said to have dispute, among other things, because Green wanted to donate all profits to charitable causes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems should also have played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social descent.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the scene.
He is said to have lived on the street for a time, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent a while in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he was enthusiastic about US blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar grips.
At the age of 15 the teenager started playing the guitar professionally and was given the chance to be on stage as lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
A little later he was hired as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton in the Bluesbreakers.
In the middle of the Blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967 with his bluesbreaker colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross" composed by Green gave the group the first number one hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted it to the lead of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its dark side: Green did not cope with the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life is the drugs - the best was to land a number one hit."
Towards the end of the decade in 1979, Green surprisingly succeeded in winning a respect with an album inspired by religious themes.
Meanwhile, Fleetwood Mac swam without him in a new formation on a wave of success.
