Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not exactly friendly.
The two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Tehran&#39;s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution that has been discussed.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been strained for years.
Washington criticizes Israel&#39;s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of a lack of will in the peace process.
The relationship between the two has deteriorated further as a result of the deal proposed by Obama for the Iranian nuclear program.
In March, Netanyahu gave a controversial speech before the US Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was partly seen as an affront to Obama.
The speech had not been agreed with Obama, who had declined a meeting with reference to the upcoming elections in Israel.
In an emergency call, Professor admits to having shot his girlfriend
In an 911 call, Professor Shannon Lamb, in a slightly shaky voice, told police that he had shot his girlfriend and that officers had to come to his home.
It was important for Lamb to stress that his &quot;cute dog&quot; was still alive and probably upset, and said the dead woman&#39;s family contacts could be found on her cellphone.
Inside the home, officers found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note scrawled on a white pad: &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I wish I could take it back, I loved Amy and she&#39;s the only woman who ever loved me&quot;. According to the authorities, this was what the letter said and it was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online classes for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus, where police say he met a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt shot and killed the door to his office.
Delta State University Police Commissioner Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18 am.
He said Lamb made the fateful 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day there was another death: Lamm took his own life as police surrounded him.
A day after the campus shooting that forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators on both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped paint a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he had written, mentioning the &quot;wonderful people&quot; with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a 17-strong faculty, and many students took courses from both.
At the same time, there were some propensities for problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, &quot;as if there was something wrong with him.&quot;
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb previously asked Delta State University for a medical leave of absence, saying he had some medical condition.
This year he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university&#39;s employment policy meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to earn would not guarantee him an automatic route to an assistant professorship.
University President William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but &quot;of course there was something in Mr. Lamb&#39;s imagination.&quot;
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping campus, police later found Lamb&#39;s trail as he re-entered Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber handgun in the back yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the driveway.
It wasn&#39;t immediately clear why Lamm went to this house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began work at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009, teaching geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring.
One of Lamb&#39;s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamm was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her to play the guitar for a few years.
He was a heartthrob back then.
All the girls melted when he was around,&quot; said Hairston, now 40 and a resident of the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss have apparently been together for some time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said &quot;I killed my wife,&quot; but there was no record of marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick home that borders a bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss&#39; ex-husband Shawn O&#39;Steen said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19.
&quot;She was absolutely devastated,&quot; O&#39;Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were absolute best friends.
O&#39;Steen said he never met Lamb, but heard through his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail were both performing at a summer carnival three years ago.
Later they played one or the other gig together.
O&#39;Steen said his daughter writes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse working for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a dimly lit bar near Gautier, said the night of September 5 was the last time he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night, after Lamb finished his guitar and harmonica playing in front of a sparse audience.
There were no signs that anything was wrong.
&quot;Just a happy couple,&quot; he said.
We were cleaning up and joking with each other.
I mean, they both had a good sense of jokes.
Schmidt, the dead professor, ran the freshman seminar program, specializing in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three small children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas and served as president of his fraternity and student council.
About 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and members of the community, attended a candlelight memorial Tuesday night at the Delta State campus in Cleveland.
Schmidt&#39;s wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the vigil while the college choir sang &quot;Bright Morning Star&quot; and &quot;Amazing Grace.&quot;
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
&quot;We&#39;re trying to get our students to return,&quot; LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus of Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana of New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say that Lamb called 911 after he shot Schmidt, and that while Lamm referred to Prentiss as his wife in his 911 call, there is no indication the two ever met have married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it won&#39;t be hiring as many holiday season workers as it did last year, but the toy and baby products retailer says it will give its current workers and seasonal workers a chance to do more hours to work.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country. At Christmas 2014, 45,000 workers were hired.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job interviews this month and the headcount will increase from October to December.
With the holidays themselves months away, the holiday shopping season is fast approaching and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to staff stores with staff to sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his &#39;date&#39; with Princess Diana
The premiere of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
She was also notable for personal reasons.
&quot;We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals and I notice that the seat next to me is empty and I&#39;m starting to realize that Princess Diana will be sitting next to me,&quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary Back In timing&quot;.
As the film begins, it occurs to me that I&#39;m a simulated yawn and an arm&#39;s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
&quot;Back for the Future&quot; premiered 30 years ago.
&quot;It really is for me,&quot; said Spielberg, &quot;arguably the greatest time travel movie ever made.&quot;
&quot;Back in Time&quot; will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon says his response to Russia&#39;s increased military support to Syria is &quot;there is no military solution&quot; to the nearly five-year conflict, and more guns will only worsen violence and misery for millions.
The UN chief once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a news conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the foreign ministers of the council&#39;s five permanent member nations - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly ministerial meeting later this month to discuss the situation in Syria to discuss.
He regretted that divisions in the Council and within the Syrian people and regional powers &quot;make this situation intractable.&quot;
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 Polls That Show Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to brand it a flop.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some are waiting for a breakdown.
But no matter how some Republicans try to drag Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it hasn&#39;t worked (yet).
Ten of the last eleven national polls have put Donald Trump in the double-digits lead, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul&#39;s chances of being nominated.
Of course, it is still too early in the election period.
No one is claiming that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that by this time in 2011, Rick Perry&#39;s leadership had been ceded to rising Herman Cain, neither of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush&#39;s Super PAC and conservative business group Club for Growth are now recognizing Trump&#39;s staying power and are beginning to pour their dollars in to topple him.
Here are some recent poll numbers that suggest the real estate mogul isn&#39;t just a passing phase:
Trump&#39;s popularity ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a poll by Monmouth University showed that only two out of ten Republicans viewed the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three in ten say they have a negative opinion.
And those numbers hold up in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found 60 percent of Republicans favor Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters GOP would be happy with Trump as their nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either &quot;thrilled&quot; or &quot;happy&quot; if Trump was nominated.
Only two in 10 say they would be &quot;upset&quot; if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates about the same excitement as Trump (43 percent say they&#39;re &quot;thrilled&quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in excitement?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;upset&quot; if establishment favorite Jeb Bush became the nominee.
A majority of Republicans don&#39;t see Trump&#39;s temper as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been widely criticized for his bombastic and insulting statements, 52 percent of Republican-leaning Irish voters believe the property mogul has the right temperament for a president, according to ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same number applies in the nation&#39;s first primary state, the state of Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn&#39;t have the personality to perform his duties effectively, and nearly six in 10 independents say his temper doesn&#39;t suit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
Putting on their scholarly hats, Republican voters think Trump is real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 say Trump is the best bet, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That&#39;s a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush in late July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters haven&#39;t had the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination versus just 28% for final nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters see Trump&#39;s campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans rallied around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some pundits point out that the fragmented field likely contributes to Trump&#39;s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffuse among more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump wins majority support.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
It&#39;s neck and neck with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would overtake the entrepreneur by 19 points in a hypothetical neck-and-neck race.
A slim majority of Donald Trump fans say they&#39;ve made up their minds.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows just over half of voters who support Trump say they firmly cast their votes.
Of course, a lot can be done to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump&#39;s closest rival right now is the other underdog, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they&#39;ve made up their minds are twice as likely to support Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico &quot;rapists&quot; in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the center of public discourse on 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump&#39;s bombastic language will keep key Hispanics out of the Republican Party and damage realignment efforts.
But according to Monday&#39;s new ABC/Post poll, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration stays in the spotlight, apparently Donald Trump will too.
Frustration with the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have around half the support of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
Six in 10 Republicans say they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience in Monday&#39;s new ABC/Post poll.
And they&#39;re angry with Washington, too.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent &quot;dissatisfied&quot; and 21 percent &quot;angry as hell.&quot;
Munich, Sylt and Co.: The five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
The most expensive residential complex is here in Hobookenweg - with a view over the North Sea tidal flats.
On the street, one square meter of a thatched roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
&quot;On Sylt, the range of objects is naturally limited,&quot; says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows the special locations in which a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student apartment in Munich is not really low.
In contrast to Germany&#39;s top places to live, the price seems like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with prices per square meter at dizzying heights.
There are sometimes several tens of thousands of euros for nothing - per square meter, mind you.
But well, if you can afford it...
By the way: For once, Munich is not at the top here.
Champions League: Bayern&#39;s dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two goalscorer in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller simply has a run.
A lucky goal from Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3-0 win at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it worked.
A confident start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze gave FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot;Mission Milan&quot; in the cauldron of Piraeus.
Coach Pep Guardiola&#39;s team won their opening game in the Champions League at Greek record champions Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller&#39;s brace (52&#39;/90&#39;+2) and Götze&#39;s goal (89&#39;) deservedly 3-0 (0-0).
The twelfth success in a row should be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola finally wants to get the handle pot to Munich in the third attempt.
When he scored his 28th goal in the Champions League to put Bayern ahead, Müller was kindly helped by Olympiacos goalkeeper Roberto, who allowed the world champion&#39;s shot that was intended as a cross to pass.
&quot;We won&#39;t underestimate them,&quot; Bayern captain Philipp Lahm promised before the game in the Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 passionate fans - and Bayern kept their word.
They showed a focused and engaged performance without shining.
Piraeus had won its most recent six home games in the premier class, including against well-known clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid and Juventus Turin.
In 2011, Borussia Dortmund also stumbled here (1:3).
But Bayern, undefeated in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They went bold, but were often unimaginative in their offensive efforts.
Attacks were too often initiated by shifting the game to left winger Douglas Costa, who rarely got through against former Braunschweig player Omar Elabdelloui.
Müller was luckier from the right when his cross from the right half-field landed in the top left corner of the goal.
In the 67th minute, the world champion missed the possible 2-0.
Robert Lewandowski had the best opportunities in the first half.
First, when Olympiacos striker Ideye Brown knocked the Pole&#39;s header off the line (26&#39;).
Then by direct acceptance, which goalkeeper Roberto parried with his knee (35th).
Although Bayern played their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to set pinpricks.
But goalkeeper Manuel Neuer was reliable.
For example, when he deflected a shot from Ideye over the bar (56th).
In front of Neuer, Guardiola had a back four defended with David Alaba in the center alongside Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, back in the squad after muscular problems, initially sat outside.
The World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training session, said sports director Matthias Sammer on &quot;Sky&quot;: &quot;Anyone who wants to make something else out of it is malicious&quot;.
Guardiola also decided against him at the first change when he brought in Kingsley Coman for the ailing Lewandowski (59th).
Götze came on late for Arturo Vidal (76th) and made everything clear 13 minutes later, Müller added another penalty with a penalty.
Before the game, there had been riots in the stadium.
After a small group of partially masked Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piraeus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and attacked the Munich supporters with batons.
At least one Bayern fan was injured and transported from the stadium.
Smokers have a higher risk of losing teeth
Anyone who smokes not only damages the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a long-term study in Potsdam.
The good news: If you do without, the risk decreases quickly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is the result of a long-term study by an international team of researchers, including several employees from the German Institute for Human Nutrition (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to lose their teeth prematurely.
The scientists observed more than 23,300 participants.
The DIfE emphasizes that the main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gums.
The authors emphasize that smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis.
The connection between smoking and tooth loss therefore goes back to more frequent gingivitis in smokers.
It has not been clarified to what extent smoking also increases the risk of tooth decay.
However, people who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers write in the &quot;Journal of Dental Research&quot;.
However, it could take over ten years for the risk to drop back to the level of non-smokers, explained lead author Thomas Dietrich from the University of Birmingham in England.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, explained study leader Heiner Boeing from DIfE: &quot;Smoking shortens lifespan.&quot;
Not smoking is good for the lungs and blood vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health into old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 are edentulous, the DIfE reported.
Previous studies have indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists come across remains from late antiquity on the banks of the Rhine in Cologne
Archaeological finds have once again been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Archaeologists from the Romano-Germanic Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historical buildings near the construction site for the new Rhine Boulevard, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the start of construction work on the Rhine, historians have been searching for so-called archaeological monuments.
In all construction projects in the Cologne district, the museum is always consulted as the specialist agency for the preservation of archaeological monuments.
The archaeologists have now found what they were looking for in the third construction phase of the Rheinboulevard.
Trier explained that it was already known from text documents that there was a fortress on the site in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman hit by freight train
After a young woman had an accident at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Linden, the federal police asked the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning at around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the tracks at the end of the platform coming from the direction of the station building and was hit by a freight train coming from Mönchengladbach.
According to the federal police, she sustained severe injuries when the train was captured.
She received emergency medical treatment at the scene and was taken to hospital by paramedics.
The investigating officers have no knowledge of the reason for the young woman crossing the tracks at night.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or local residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers-by from Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are eligible.
Information that provides information about the cause of the accident can be given on the 24-hour and free hotline of the federal police on 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
To defuse the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the EU Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system that is much more similar to traditional courts in terms of its functioning.
&quot;We want to set up a system that citizens trust,&quot; said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström at the presentation.
The Swede plans to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced support.
TTIP aims to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people.
The plans for the reform of the current arbitration procedures provide for the EU states and the USA to jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come in equal parts from the EU, the USA and third countries.
A second instance is also planned for the first time.
It would allow appeals against judgments.
So far, those involved in the proceedings have agreed among themselves on arbitrators, and there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
In the discussion over the past few months, it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old ISDS system in terms of fairness and justice, commented Malmström.
According to her own statements, she wants to work towards an international investment court in the long term.
Disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could then be clarified there, for example.
The investor-state arbitration procedures (ISDS) demanded above all by large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance to TTIP in Europe.
The traditional courts of arbitration have been criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice system that companies can use to claim damages from taxpayers, undermine national laws or enforce lowering of consumer and environmental standards.
In initial statements, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact described the EU Commission&#39;s proposals as inadequate.
The main criticism was that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (Ceta).
The German State Secretary for Economic Affairs Matthias Machnig (SPD), on the other hand, described the plans as great progress.
In the reform, the Commission is taking into account key points that Federal Economics Minister Sigmar Gabriel worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring.
The old system of private arbitration courts is off the table.
The French government also welcomed Malmström&#39;s plans.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against restricting the legal options for business through too many new rules.
Small and medium-sized companies in particular could be disadvantaged as a result, it said.
It was still unclear on Wednesday when talks on the TTIP (Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership) free trade agreement could be concluded.
Negotiations have been going on since mid-2013.
However, the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the USA.
A framework for the agreement was originally supposed to be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer considered tenable.
Delicate Folk by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens sat on the stage in Cologne&#39;s Prime Club (today: Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy-looking folk singer has drawn the picturesque US state of Michigan with a felt pen.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost moved by Steven&#39;s presentation.
Using various places, which he repeatedly draws on the map, he tells the story of what his meticulously and delicately arranged songs tell about.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proven to be a wonderfully creative lunatic.
With the third album &quot;Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State&quot;, released in 2003, cleverly composed songs appear that are harmonically very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can drift into great opulence at any time.
The rumor spreads that &quot;Michigan&quot; would be the first part of a daring series: Each of the 50 US states should be sung about in a row.
But &quot;Seven Swans&quot; was already released in 2004 and near the Rhine and positively breaks certain expectations.
Stevens appears reduced here.
Guitar and banjo are enough for him live.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
&quot;Illinois&quot; (&quot;Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise&quot;) was released in 2005, a masterpiece that was celebrated across the board.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album enters the American Billboard Charts and is not missing from any year&#39;s list of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then makes extensive use of electronic elements on &quot;The Age of Adz&quot; (2010).
This decent sixth studio album is still broadly orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and reverberations.
Long gone from the smaller clubs, the stage shows here are a colorful spectacle of neon headbands and large fluorescent stage decorations.
Sufjan Stevens is currently touring through Germany as part of a five-piece band.
In the dark Hamburger Mehr!
Theater he mainly presents &quot;Carrie &amp; Lowell&quot;, which has been available since March.
Although almost 2,000 guests are now sitting spellbound in their chairs, the much more mature Stevens is returning to intimacy and folk.
Without saying a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians play their way through the broadly enriched album.
One hears from the audience: the lecture is &quot;more opulent&quot; and one could &quot;basically throw away the record&quot;.
Stevens only modestly thanks for an encore, acoustically plays a few older songs and finally bows to thunderous applause.
Jeremy Corbyn&#39;s debut at Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time
Since his election, Mr Corbyn&#39;s debut at Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time has been eagerly awaited
New Labor leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his debut at Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time and take on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six set questions just after midday, with his performance likely to be scrutinized by the media and Labor MPs at close range.
He called for &quot;less drama and more facts&quot; at this weekly event.
He has also said he can skip some sessions to let colleagues do them.
The encounter will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn&#39;s leadership as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and his speech at Tuesday&#39;s TUC annual meeting.
Meanwhile, the Labor leader&#39;s decision to remain silent during the singing of the national anthem at a commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain on Tuesday has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and has been the focus of several front-page Stories in the newspapers.
Mr Corbyn&#39;s decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had &quot;respected silence&quot; and acknowledged the &quot;Heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain&quot;.
But a member of Mr Corbyn&#39;s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told BBC Two&#39;s Newsnight program that he had advised the Labor leader to sing the national anthem &quot;regardless&quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve on Mr Corbyn&#39;s top team, citing differences on the economy, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also &quot;piling up&quot; within Labour, following Mr Corbyn&#39;s comments on the European Union&#39;s position on capping profits.
Mr Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labor is tabling amendments to remove the whole idea of a cap altogether.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow Works and Pensions Minister, said the party was &quot;very clear&quot; that it was only opposed to Government plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labor leader to face David Cameron across the dispatch box in Parliament since he became Tory leader in the last decade.
The Labor leader, who has promised a different approach to policy, says he has &quot;crowd-sourced&quot; ideas for questions for Mr Cameron and has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time is too confrontational and that he will refrain from both &quot;quick wit&quot; and barbed arguing and has instead pledged to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people to concentrate.
Mr Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, will represent him when he is not attending - for example when Mr Cameron is traveling abroad.
He has also floated the idea of other colleagues speaking occasionally and that he has approached Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the &quot;Punch and Judy&quot; style of politics often associated with Prime Minister&#39;s Question Time. But a few years later he admitted that he had failed at it.
Since it was first televised in 1990, Question Time with the Prime Minister has been seen as the prime barometer of a leader&#39;s judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his standing among his peers in Parliament, although critics have argued that it has become caricature and needs it far-reaching reforms.

Pound rises on accelerating UK wage growth
The pound jumped after data showing a pick-up in UK wage growth. At the same time, the FTSE 100 was boosted by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, UK non-bonus earnings grew by 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and provided estimates of when interest rates would rise.
The pound was up more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505 and was up 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 Index ended up 1.49% at 6,229.21.
SABMiller was the standout stock on the market, jumping 20% after receiving a takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the world&#39;s two largest breweries, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% on encouraging news from luxury goods rival Richemont.
Richemont&#39;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - are again reporting growth.
Shares in Glencore rose 5% after the mining giant said it raised $2.5 billion from a share sale as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, falling 4.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded its rating on the company to &quot;sell&quot;.
JD Sports rose 3.1% after the sportswear company reported pre-tax profit of $46.6 million for the half-year.
JD Sports chief says higher wages threaten expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot;more buying power in the pockets of potential customers&quot;.
But that purchasing power is unlikely to offset higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The expense could hit JD Sports&#39; expansion plans, he added, and that could mean fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: On a Bieber expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber, Megastar.
Ridiculous 21 years young, a linnet with a very chic hairstyle.
The guy with the platinum blonde hair is worth 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Monsieur Bieber is currently in Berlin.
And the U17 generation is going crazy.
Like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name &quot;Ritz Carlton&quot;.
Not bad.
Hundreds of fans joined Justin yesterday.
Among them Ewa and Viktoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Pole has been sitting on the cold stone slabs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: This is where her idol lives, whose posters have been hanging in abundance in Szczecin since Monday evening.
The suite in which the Canadian singer lives costs exactly as much per day as her mother Ewa earns in six months.
If any.
She says: &quot;Actually, my Wiktoria should be in the tenth grade at high school.&quot;
&quot;I&#39;ll fulfill her dream&quot;.
compulsory education?
Who cares?
The fans don&#39;t.
Neither does Bieber himself.
He&#39;s taken care of anyway.
He earned three million for advertising during the Super Bowl commercial break, and a two-year deal with an anti-pimple company brought many, many dollars into the Bieber account.
And for every doll that looks like him that goes over the counter, Bieber cashes in, too.
When Justin Bieber drinks a coffee, people are amazed at the window pane.
He is said to have captured more than 100 million.
Some say the hype has gone too far.
Others point out that Bieber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot;What Do You Mean?&quot; in 1st place.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeros at first.
At least he pretends so.
Pegida poster gives Lebanese idea of potato kebabs
Potatoes or doner kebab?
Both are possible - namely in the potato kebab that the Oldenburg snack bar owner Hani Alhay developed.
Inspired by the slogan &quot;Potatoes instead of doner kebabs&quot; on a Pegida movement poster, Alhay put potatoes and meat together on a skewer.
A poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription &quot;Potatoes instead of doner kebabs,&quot; which he happened to see on television, gave him the idea.
Since then, a spit with meat and potatoes has been rotating in his shop.
&quot;It&#39;s multicultural for the stomach,&quot; says Alhay.
The Lebanese has now registered the idea with the patent office in Munich.
According to the authorities, it has recently been protected there as a utility model.
Alhay does not want to reveal how much meat and how many potatoes the skewer contains.
Only so much: &quot;It tastes even better together,&quot; he thinks.
The culinary international understanding is also well received by his customers.
Metcash launches down-to-earth campaign to combat Aldi incursion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores from an Aldi march in South Australia and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend IGA retailers&#39; market share in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700m Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local grocery suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social marketing Media, as well as events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA retailers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands including Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo handing out samples at IGA stores and shopkeepers selling discounted South Australian Football League tickets to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release more details of its defense strategy on Sept. 29 when the grocery, alcohol and appliances wholesaler conducts its annual Investor Strategy Day.
The stakes are high as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Metcash&#39;s IGA stores and generate higher profit margins than Metcash&#39;s Eastern States IGA network.
Shoppers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers command a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in South Australia and 24 per cent in Western Australia compared to around 14 per cent in Australia the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that 12 months after its first stores open, Aldi will snap up about 5 percent of the grocery market in those two states, stealing sales from all existing players, but mainly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales a year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA over the next year and generate sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and grocery business and volumes on Metcash&#39;s high fixed cost basis could cost Metcash about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent Roy Morgan survey found that IGA shoppers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley expects Metcash&#39;s food and grocery sales to fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and its 14 percent market share in 2015 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, at a business lunch in Melbourne, lead fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told Metcash that Metcash will probably be out of business within a decade. Metcash will disappear.
Metcash declined to publicly respond to Mr Douglass&#39; comments.
But it is understood that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
IGA&#39;s market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenue from Metcash&#39;s food and grocery business, which serves about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational deleveraging while squeezing sales and margins .
However, the wholesaler is fighting back, investing more than $150 million to align retail prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week and to help IGA retailers improve their stores with faster-growing fresh produce and better private-label selection - to deliver groceries.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says pricing adjustments and store refurbishment programs will add momentum and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is joined by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the &quot;collateral damages&quot; in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own conduct, according to Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo consistently dubbed the &#39;Special Ks&#39;, came under the spotlight after Kyrgios&#39; infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati soon after, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison were twice separated by the referee, with Harrison exclaiming, &quot;Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have punched the kid.&quot;
While he was last seen smashing a tennis racquet after a spasm thwarted a potential US Open win by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was staunchly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in singles behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semifinals against Great Britain.
&quot;One thing I&#39;m quite upset about is the fact that I think Thanasi got a little involved in the argument,&quot; Healy said.
He broke a racquet when he lost the US Open to a cramp, but he&#39;s not the first player to break a racquet out of frustration with himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he did is not proud of it.
But, really, he&#39;s done extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and such, and I think he deserves a lot of credit.
He&#39;s got a great team around him, he&#39;s got a great family around him, and I think he&#39;s been treated a little too harshly.
He&#39;s a very mature 19-year-old, he works very hard and he fits into the team and so on, he&#39;s never had a problem with the other players, he&#39;s respected in the locker room, he trains hard, he&#39;s in Form, he is a very stable and mature young chap and I believe he deserves to be judged on his own merits.
Healy also backed the decision not to consider Kyrgios in the all-important prelim that begins on Friday, and he describes the &quot;joint decision&quot; as the right thing for everyone, but he assures the Canberra man as a long-term integral part of the team to return.&quot;
&quot;First of all, we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not on all the controversy surrounding [Kyrgios],&quot; said Healy.
And I think Nick made the climb very quickly, which people like Federer and Murray pointed out. He&#39;s rising in the public eye and he&#39;s made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he&#39;s getting but we&#39;re trying to support him, we&#39;re trying to make him understand the consequences of his actions. I think some time out of the limelight where he can just think about it is appropriate and it&#39;s best for the team and it&#39;s best for him.
Europe&#39;s refugee crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes the border, holds back refugees
Hungary declared a state of emergency and sealed off its southern border with Serbia on Tuesday, detaining anyone attempting to enter the country illegally. All with the aim of stopping the influx of migrants.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants massed in a no man&#39;s land and Serb officials reacted with outrage.
The people fleeing violence were stuck in a strip of land on the road between the two countries&#39; checkpoints for an unknown amount of time, pitching tents and settling there.
But frustrations mounted.
As a police helicopter hovered overhead, the migrants chanted &quot;Open the border!&quot; and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia&#39;s foreign minister said it was &quot;unacceptable&quot; that migrants were being sent back from Hungary while more and more were arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution and not collateral damage.
Talks must take place with Brussels and other countries in the coming days,&quot; said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The turbulence on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a contentious meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in by surprise Italy and Greece. They expressed their hope that an agreement would eventually be reached - next month or by the end of the year - that EU countries would take in another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special European Union summit to discuss the continent&#39;s immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, did not pin its hopes on early action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency declared in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum processes.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said his country is also planning to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stem the flow of migrants through the country - after finishing a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D&#39;Agata reported that even prison inmates were used in the race to build the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant bottleneck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most arrivals are economic refugees in search of a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view at odds with other EU states, including Germany , stands.
The new laws, which came into effect at midnight in Hungary, make it a crime to cross the border or damage the 4-meter (13-foot) high fence the government has built along the southern border with Serbia. These laws also set higher prison terms for convicted traffickers.
&quot;Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency,&quot; government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to procedurally approve the military&#39;s deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, country security adviser for Orban, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, while 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come over by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and charged with committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are in the process of quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train car carrying barbed wire to close the borders arrived.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people&#39;s data and a crowd squeezed to squeeze in.
About 20 managed to get in, but thousands stayed outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway linking Serbia and Hungary and said they would be denied food and water until allowed to enter Hungary.
Election-2016: Hillary Clinton cuts lead over Bernie Sanders in national poll by half
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the national nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is gaining ground on her.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the primary (up from 58 percent), while Sanders is second at 27 percent (up 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, has support from 15 percent of Democratic voters in the primary.
With more than five months to go before the primary begins, most Democratic voters say it&#39;s too early to say their minds are set on which candidate they will support.
But Clinton&#39;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost across a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a large lead among women and moderates, but those leads have narrowed.
Their men&#39;s support has dropped significantly, and Sanders is just 5 points behind here.
Clinton&#39;s advantage among Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, and she and Sanders are now level.
However, Clinton still has a large lead among older voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders by a double-digit lead in the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
About half of the Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support her because she is the candidate.
Six percent would not support them.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton&#39;s current supporters are particularly smitten with her.
Views are more mixed among those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support her enthusiastically.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they enthusiastically support Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same about their lead candidate, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton&#39;s supporters are asked an open-ended question as to why they want her to be the nominee, the most common response is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it&#39;s time for a woman president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton&#39;s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Agreement to deal with the issues and eligibility are also cited.
Because the vice president holds potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters want him in the running -- although a third believe he shouldn&#39;t.
When Democratic primary voters are asked who their second pick for the party would be, Biden comes out on top.
Of Clinton&#39;s supporters, more than half say Biden would be their second choice, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton&#39;s lead over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the election; however, that number has fallen from 78 percent in the last month.
Biden is a distant second on that measurement, but the percentage who see him as the &quot;most eligible&quot; is up.
Still, when asked what is more important in a candidate, Democratic voters raise questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, not a single Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out as unacceptable to these primary voters.
The Democratic candidate or potential candidate performs well on some key characteristics among voters in their party&#39;s primary.
Majorities view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy, with strong leadership qualities.
Out of the three candidates, Biden scores best on honesty, while Clinton&#39;s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters don&#39;t believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say the same about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
By all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions continue to be asked about Hillary Clinton&#39;s use of a personal email address and server during her tenure as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation of the matter and say it hasn&#39;t affected their opinions overall.
But it&#39;s a different story with the American public altogether.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their explanation, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the issue came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy hadn&#39;t affected their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her had worsened.
It&#39;s mostly Republicans, more than six in 10, who say their views of Clinton have deteriorated.
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by voters in her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: just 32 percent see her as honest and trustworthy, down 8 percent from last month and down 15 points since May.
62 percent of eligible voters do not consider her to be an honest and trustworthy person.
At the same time, 55 percent of eligible voters nationwide also see Trump as dishonest and untrustworthy.
However, Clinton and Trump get good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush score best on honesty.
A majority sees Sanders as more honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is trailing behind Donald Trump in a nationwide poll
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates now hold half of voter support in the new poll, with others losing traction dramatically
Republican voters nationwide continue to support Trump in large numbers. Support grows from 23% in the latest CBS poll, conducted ahead of Fox News&#39; debate last month, to 27% in Tuesday&#39;s poll.
But Carson shot from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also found that Carson resonates well with demographic groups and outperforms Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The rest of the field, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, is trailing with Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker falling the deepest, from 10% support last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are in third place with 6%.
The margin of error for the sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows Carson rising in the polls - landing at 19% Republican support, behind Trump at 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also put Trump well ahead of Carson.
Looking at a Carson rising last week, Trump found some digs at the former neurosurgeon, even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump&#39;s beliefs.
&quot;We need energy,&quot; Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm.
Even if peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for beach holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some no longer go into the sea: The water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, according to the German Weather Service (DWD).
The Mediterranean Sea, on the other hand, continues to offer bathing temperatures: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
In the Adriatic it is 25 degrees at the top, in France 23 degrees.
The Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees.
Five fraternity members implicated in death of Baruch College freshman
Nearly two years after a student died during a victimized sorority ritual in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are being filed against five people.
Members of New York&#39;s Baruch College Pi-Delta Psi Fraternity brutally attacked Chun &quot;Michael&quot; Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013, delaying his transport to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he was blindfolded, loaded with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and repeatedly attacked while attempting to walk toward a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of a headache, then he fell unconscious.
Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood members did not call 911 after Deng passed out and reportedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they did have the time to change Deng&#39;s clothes, google his symptoms and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity&#39;s national president, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
&quot;At that point, members began to hide paraphernalia and fundamentally put the well-being of the Brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng,&quot; said Police Commissioner Wagner.
He could not be revived and died of his injuries the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt force injuries to his head, torso and thighs.
&quot;Too many families have been destroyed by the fraternity&#39;s harassment. At least one student has died from the harassment every year since 1970,&quot; said Douglas Fierberg, an attorney representing Deng&#39;s family, in a statement.
Fraternities and their members must be held accountable and this step by authorities is very important.
A Monroe County Grand Jury recommended third-degree murder charges for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, are also charged with harassment and forming a criminal organization.
&quot;We not only want to hold the people involved responsible, but if there is an organization that - officially or unofficially - has sanctioned this, we will also hold them accountable,&quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College has banned the fraternity and the national fraternity has revoked its affiliation with the chapter.
That&#39;s what will happen if the Fed hikes interest rates
A rate hike is coming and the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise and the economy will slide into recession.
We know this.
What we don&#39;t know is how long this will all last and how long it will last.
In particular, for business, history offers little guidance on how to proceed.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial assets react.
That&#39;s why Federal Reserve officials have been so vehement that investors shouldn&#39;t focus on when it will start raising interest rates, but rather on the time it takes for the rate to normalize.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the excitement about a rate hike may have been overdone.
&quot;The Fed&#39;s first hike since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the &#39;easy money&#39; era,&quot; said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note to clients.
In contrast, we do not expect US interest rates to gradually return to normal levels, but still at levels too low to trigger the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, that doesn&#39;t mean there won&#39;t be an impact.
Here&#39;s a look at how some areas of the economy might react, based on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month, anticipating rate hikes can make things volatile for a while.
Once the raise arrives, the impact isn&#39;t as dramatic.
&quot;There appears to be a tendency for asset returns to stall 12 to 24 months after the first hike, perhaps again reflecting the lag in monetary policy,&quot; Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what happens after the Fed hikes rates .
More specifically, the market has been mostly up for the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to a rate hike, fairly flat in the 250 days thereafter (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published by Barron&#39;s Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on stocks tends to come later in the appreciation cycle and the yield begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but they are often fueled by interest rate hikes.
In the current case, the Fed faces some conditions that did not exist before that could accelerate a recession.
Most notably, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point if the Fed hikes rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rate hikes since 1950, nominal GDP has only fallen below 4.5 percent twice.
Although the second quarter of 2015 came in at 3.6 percent, few expect this to continue, expecting just 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in such a fragile economic backdrop could be risky, raising the question &quot;whether it&#39;s different this time,&quot; Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been bracing for a Fed rate hike all year and all eyes have been on this week&#39;s Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe the FOMC could approve a hike this session, futures trading is only listing a 25 percent probability.
&quot;In our study, all cycles of increases from 1950 to the present have occurred in a super-cycle with accelerating momentum in GDP, dwarfing pre-recession highs very quickly after the recovery began,&quot; says the report.
In contrast, this is a decidedly slow recovery from what was the worst recession of the period under review.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has waited since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income has also been volatile as the market anticipates a rate hike and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market.
The main difference is that bonds act faster than stocks when they change their strategic course.
For bonds, yields seem to reverse direction once the first hike/cut in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the hike cycle, bond yields fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab&#39;s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields to narrow between longer and shorter bonds, flattening the curve.
High-yield bonds often produce better returns in such a climate, although &quot;we remain cautious about expecting higher returns,&quot; said Kathy Jones, fixed income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
What&#39;s interesting, Jones says, is that markets have already adjusted to Fed strategy expectations.
&quot;Alongside the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,&quot; she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve has flattened, credit spreads have widened and volatility has increased - all hallmarks of the market as the Fed tightens its strategy.
Overall, companies that do most of their business in the US will benefit as interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinationals with high levels of debt will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global market and more expensive to fund their debt.
&quot;History shows that &#39;quality&#39; stocks tend to react overwhelmingly positively three months after an initial rate hike,&quot; Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report to clients.
Firms with strong balance sheets have outperformed firms with weak balance sheets by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the 1994, 1999 and 2004 rate hikes.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low-quality peers by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of floating rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside of the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers could see gains from higher yields, though experts disagree on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Member of Parliament Andrew Bingham
The Conservative Member of Parliament criticized the broadcaster for being &quot;dumbed down&quot;
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just impersonating The Brits
Member of Parliament Damien Collins attacked The Voice program saying it was not very original.
BBC Radio 3 is &#39;shifting&#39; to Classic FM, claims a senior MP, adding new pressure on the station to prove it&#39;s doing something the commercial stations aren&#39;t.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC bosses that the public radio station was &quot;stupid&quot; and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rivals.
&quot;Radio 3 seems - I hate to use the word &#39;dumb&#39; - but it seems to be morphing into Classic FM,&quot; he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which kicked off last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, appear to be The Brits just under a different name.
So if you&#39;re trying to do something different - these are two off-the-cuff examples where you&#39;re really just imitating what&#39;s already out there,&quot; Mr Bingham said.
BBC Director-General dismissed the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is well ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I am learning from Radio 3 I will never learn about classical music anywhere else.
And there&#39;s a commitment to live music and music-making that&#39;s truly second to none.
&quot;And I think Radio 3&#39;s commitment to finding new music and commissioning new work is really important too,&quot; he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that because Brits are less informed about classical music, it needs to work harder to engage audiences than it has in the past.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production to come under fire during the Culture, Media and Sport Selection Committee hearing for stepping on commercial rivals&#39; toes.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the BBC&#39;s musical talent show which was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated cost of £22m.
Do you see why this program is often discussed as being unoriginal and not particularly distinctive?
Lord Hall insisted the BBC 1 show - with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced &quot;in a special BBC way&quot;.
He added that he wishes the company could &quot;find a hit from our in-house stable&quot; the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future or to spend fee-payers&#39; money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales grew the slowest in August and Black Friday may be to blame
In the first three months of 2015 there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month was the lowest reading since records began in 2000
Online sales boosted three years ago with the use of cellphones for shopping
Experts believe November&#39;s Black Friday slowed spending
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed and many of the UK&#39;s high streets have turned into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are flat, after new figures showed just 7 percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August presented the lowest increase in growth since records began in 2000, up just 5 percent year-on-year.
Experts say there are signs online sales are stagnating after new figures showed just 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot;If you look at growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that&#39;s always been evolving over time,&quot; Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took off three years ago when shoppers started making purchases using their phones.
It meant more people could shop online and people could do so in different environments, e.g. B. at home on the sofa.
But now that&#39;s leveling off and we may see growth slow down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is cited as one reason for the slowing sales.
Experts believe shoppers are holding back their purchases ahead of this event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
In the past year, five times the average number of shoppers have flocked to their computers to snap up their bargains, and some retailer websites have crashed.
Experts believe Black Friday, when shoppers battled each other over bargains, could discourage shoppers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that for every £5 spent, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in city center chains.
Muslims bury those killed in the crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden&#39;s family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first burials in Mecca
Saudi Arabia blames the collapse in part on the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
The Health Ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane fell
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those killed when a crane at Mecca&#39;s Grand Mosque collapsed.
Mourners, dressed largely in white, filled the route to pay their respects as the first of the dead made their final journey to Al Moaissem Cemetery.
The funeral procession passed by the holy site, where just days before a construction crane crashed through the mosque&#39;s ceiling and onto the worshipers.
The bodies were cleared for burial as the Saudi king sanctioned the Bin Laden family construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 worshipers killed when a crane fell through Mecca&#39;s Grand Central Mosque were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, father of four, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr Akram was with his parents at the Grand Mosque before the start of the annual Hajj.
Saudi officials have already given firm pledges that the Hajj to Mecca will continue with thousands continuing to flock to the city.
Today, King Salman said the bin Laden group should not have left the crane&#39;s arm when it was not in use.
An Arabic version of the decree, released by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the bin Laden group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The news agency&#39;s English-language service did not report the detail, but said the company&#39;s management was banned from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to fall, which plunged into a courtyard of the Grand Mosque where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathering ahead of the Hajj, which takes place later this month.
The bin Laden group has not released any statements about the collapse of de Kran, and its representatives were not available for comment.
The Royal Decree also reprimanded the group for not up to date safety measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surround Mecca&#39;s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project spearheaded by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes on major construction projects.
The late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a renegade son dispossessed from his family in the 1990s.
The crane&#39;s crash came amid high winds and rain, just days before millions arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the lifetime of every sane Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain hospitalized.
Government officials ordered 1 million rials (£174,000) to be paid to families of those killed and the same amount to those permanently injured.
Other injured persons receive half of this amount.
B&amp;Q Boss says the days of cheap Eastern European craftsmen are over
Brits are increasingly employing craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of qualified craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
This will result in 200 more Screwfix stores targeting artisans being opened
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&amp;Q outlets across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent of the Daily Mail
It is said that Brits are putting down their hammers and brushes in favor of employing skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work in their homes
If you&#39;re skilled with a hammer or a brush to paint walls, you&#39;re apparently in the minority these days.
Britons are increasingly hiring handymen to do do-it-yourself jobs in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&amp;Q.
Véronique Laury, new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a large surge in the number of skilled tradespeople from Eastern Europe offering services at rock-bottom prices has now been outpaced.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 more Screwfix shops targeting craftsmen and close 60 B&amp;Q outlets.
Mrs Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&amp;Q shops because eight out of ten in-store purchasing decisions are made by women.
At the moment, the majority of the employees are men.
She said there is a need to address growing demographic trends that are showing more single female households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs Laury said: &quot;There is still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to shift this more towards a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the decisions about buying items made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Mrs Laury, who is one of only five women at the helm of a UK leader in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in senior positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 percent women on its team, including its executive board and chief financial officer.
Mrs Laury said: &quot;This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here.
It wasn&#39;t difficult to find good women for our board of directors.
Kingfisher reported a decline in half-year profit and sales after the group shouldered the cost of closing stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&amp;Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials on trial for breach of trust
At the regional court in Klagenfurt, two officials of the Austrian volleyball runners-up Aich/Dob had to answer for breach of trust and tax evasion on Wednesday.
The defendants pleaded not guilty.
One of them had also been charged with abuse of office.
He was legally acquitted of this charge in May.
The current trial has been adjourned.
According to senior public prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that between 2006 and 2011 the accused used funds from club accounts, which they were allowed to use in their functions, for private purposes.
He estimates the damage at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial crimes.
This fact was ruled out by the chair of the jury panel, judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
Regarding the rejection of infidelity, the defense argued that the association had never suffered a financial disadvantage.
The sports officials only charged expense allowances and led the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, out of debt - the liabilities in 2001 were around 600,000 schillings (approx. 44,000 euros) .
&quot;At that time we were faced with the situation: should we continue the club or should we close it?&quot; said one of the accused, a day job as a large-scale auditor for the tax office.
Together with his colleague and co-accused, he then decided to take on this task.
With all the risks.
&quot;We advanced money and put our life insurance at the bank as security,&quot; he said at the hearing.
It was agreed with the association: You can freely manage the money, only no debts may be incurred.
Furthermore - with corresponding financial success - the payment of the expense allowances was decided retrospectively to 1991.
Therefore, part of the expense allowances were only paid out years later, namely from 2003, when there was a plus in the account.
That&#39;s why flat-rate and not detailed debits appeared, explained the former chairman of the processes.
The two defendants managed the accounts and savings books together, said the second defendant.
The judge asked why the payments had not been disclosed to the association in detail.
The association was not interested in the details of financial management, only being debt-free was important, was the answer.
When investigations into abuse of office began against one official in 2011, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association&#39;s account.
Those were reserves, the defendants explained.
This securities account was in the name of the second accused and, according to his statement, was not known to the association.
&quot;Why?&quot; the judge wanted to know.
The interviewee had no answer for a long time.
Then he finally said he believed it was the best thing for the club.
If something had happened to him, nobody would have known about this money, the prosecutor pointed out.
The co-defendant had been informed, the official justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as &quot;damage compensation&quot;.
Why compensation? the judge and prosecutor wanted to know.
The first defendant then stated that he had not agreed with this wording because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do when the lawyer says: &quot;You&#39;re all off the hook with him&quot;.
&quot;Am I a legal representative?&quot; he asked.
The functionary also said that he had never received a cent salary, he had only charged mileage allowance and diets.
He billed the club 1,000 euros a month for diets, but the actual expenditure was much higher, he added.
The defendants could not produce precise documents for the early years.
After an audit, in which everything was judged to be correct, these were no longer kept, they explained.
The second accused had also received mileage allowance.
All payments were made in cash, so he had to drive from his home in Völkermarkt to the bank in Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The main hearing will continue on September 23 with the questioning of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard cuts another 30,000 jobs
In addition to the downsizing that has been going on for three years, the computer giant will cut more jobs when the company is split up.
The job cuts at the US computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not coming to an end.
The US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer division as part of its restructuring.
This should save costs of 2.7 billion dollars (2.4 billion euros), the company announced on Tuesday.
The step will lead to a special charge of around 2.7 billion dollars, which will be incurred from the fourth quarter.
The job cuts of 55,000 that have been going on for three years have not yet been completed.
At the end of the 2013/14 fiscal year, HP still employed around 302,000 people.
Hewlett-Packard shares fell 2.3 percent in after-hours trading.
The group from Palo Alto, California, which grew up with printers, is currently splitting up: The computer and printer business is to be bundled in a new company this year - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services.
Both parts of the business are to be listed on the stock exchange.
The world&#39;s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo was recently hit by disappointing PC sales again and weaker demand from corporate customers for its services.
In the third fiscal quarter ending July, PC and printer sales fell 11.5 percent.
Sales fell 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
As a result, revenue fell in 15 of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company, led by Meg Whitman, was slow to respond to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and doing more business online.
Whitman&#39;s restructuring plans envisage a total of around 55,000 job cuts.
Conflicts: Majority supports anti-IS training mission
A direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would, however, meet with overwhelming rejection: 54 percent spoke out against it, 35 percent said they agreed.
61 percent find it positive that other states are flying airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria.
24 percent are against intervening in the conflict.
Fifty-one percent of respondents reject cooperation with the Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, while 20 percent would be in favor.
29 percent could not decide.
Auto: Second press day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the fair until September 27th will be connected, self-driving cars and electromobility.
After two days of press, Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Motor Show on Thursday under the motto &quot;Mobility connects&quot;.
The general public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
Like two years ago, the organizers from the VDA car association are expecting around 900,000 visitors.
Röszke: Outbreak of violence on the Serbian-Hungarian border
The Hungarian police used tear gas and water cannons against several hundred angry refugees on the Serbian border near Röszke.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He reported over the phone:
A group of refugees broke through the border.
A police line had formed behind them and a water cannon was ready behind the policemen.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at the officers.
The officers used pepper spray at first.
After that, the police used tear gas.
Much tear gas was sprayed in the direction of the refugees.
With that, the group was disbanded.
The refugees have now withdrawn a little while waiting.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone.
Children who inhaled the tear gas screamed.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
The press officers of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time to decide interest rates for the US Federal Reserve
The world is watching as the Federal Reserve meets over two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the crucial decision on whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A poll of 80 economists polled by Reuters found that just over half who last week thought the Fed would do so now think the Fed will hold on a little longer and will keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.25 percent.
It&#39;s a historic event because it&#39;s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to ZERO.
&quot;For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a major central bank may exit zero territory and begin a process of normalizing interest rates,&quot; said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is performing relatively well, adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and generating little inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook for global conditions.
She has warned markets to brace for a hike, but signs suggest the odds against such a move are good.
The decision is scheduled to be announced at 20:00 CET on Thursday
Gunman at Delta State University left letters of apology
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb penned a note to say he was &quot;sorry&quot; about the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it,&quot; authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, an associate professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 am Monday morning
and said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the 911 operator that police needed to send officers to his home.
He said &quot;I shot my wife last night&quot; and he also mentioned that there was a &quot;cute dog&quot; in the house who &quot;won&#39;t bother anyone&quot; but will probably be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shooting.
When police arrived on the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which read: &quot;I&#39;m so sorry, I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me.&quot;
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, before ultimately taking his own life Monday night when cops surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but &quot;of course there was something in Mr. Lamb&#39;s imagination.&quot;
Despite reports Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss was also in a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said Tuesday there was &quot;no information, no evidence&quot; of a &quot;triangular relationship.&quot;
Prentiss was described as a &quot;good man&quot; by Shawn O&#39;Steen, who testified that they were married for about seven years.
The two divorced 15 years ago but have remained friends.
O&#39;Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter who is 19 and that she is &quot;devastated&quot;.
He said that Prentiss and their daughter were &quot;absolutely best friends&quot;.
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who has been identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said that Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
&quot;She always wanted to help other people,&quot; Knowles said
Police said Lamb called relatives at one point Monday to tell them &quot;he&#39;s not going to jail.&quot;
When cops caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb overturned his car, fled on foot, ran into the woods and shot himself.
Lamb received his PhD from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his resume on the university&#39;s website.

All of this is sure to take its toll.
Eurowings: Lufthansa is reorganizing the group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate restructuring.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with better organization alone.
The restructuring of the group will cost 150 of the approximately 1,000 managers worldwide their jobs.
However, there are new negotiations with the pilots&#39; union.
Lufthansa is reorganizing its corporate structure and upgrading the low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The aim of the realignment is an earnings contribution of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline announced on Wednesday.
Among other things, there will no longer be a board member responsible for passenger business at Lufthansa.
The low-cost airline Eurowings should be developed as independently as possible.
In future, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be responsible for Eurowings on the board of directors around boss Carsten Spohr.
With the realignment, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group wants to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
So far, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines operated under the umbrella of the Passenger Airline Group, which accounts for three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
New negotiations with the pilots
In the collective bargaining dispute with the pilots&#39; association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed this Thursday after the strike was stopped by the court.
This was announced by the union.
The subject of the talks is said to be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible &quot;in a year with a forecast record result&quot;.
The conflict between the union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
In addition to the transitional provision for the pilots, the background is the &quot;Wings&quot; savings concept.
It provides that Lufthansa outsources routes to the group&#39;s own low-cost airline Eurowings in the fight against competitors.

Manchester United&#39;s Luke Shaw has been out of the game for months due to a double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg during Manchester&#39;s Champions League defeat at PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-back cry and will rule him out of play for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is not giving up hope Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless 15th-minute attack from Héctor Moreno after Shaw, 20, broke into the PSV area.
He was treated on the field for nine minutes and required oxygen before being rushed to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: &quot;He has a double leg fracture and is in hospital.&quot;
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It&#39;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has a very difficult time and then plays fantastic and then this happens.
In the dressing room he wore an oxygen mask.
He cried.
I&#39;m not a doctor but if you have a double fracture it will take six months and he won&#39;t play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno appeared happy to have escaped a red card and a penalty being awarded.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, didn&#39;t penalize the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty and a red card were due.
It was a very bad attack with both legs.
A tweet on Shaw&#39;s account read, &quot;Thank you all for your messages. Words cannot describe how broken I am, my road to recovery begins now, I&#39;ll come back stronger.&quot;
Related: Manchester United suffer the loss of Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The England defender has an extra incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: &quot;It&#39;s a very bad injury.&quot;
When a player leaves the pitch with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never our players&#39; intention to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while Mexico played Van Gaal&#39;s Holland side at the 2014 World Cup.
&quot;He&#39;s struggling because it wasn&#39;t his intention to hurt the opponent and then when you hear that it&#39;s a very bad injury, that&#39;s not good,&quot; said Cocu.
It was not possible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I couldn&#39;t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: &quot;I know how it feels, I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel very bad about it. I am so sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after a foul by Chris Smalling.
Surely David Cameron knows The Lorax better?
There&#39;s one thing every parent soon learns: if your child loves a book, it won&#39;t be long before you know it almost by heart.
Unless you might be David Cameron.
When asked by a childcare system provider to name his favorite children&#39;s book, the Prime Minister settled on The Lorax, the 1971 environmental fable by Dr. seuss
It was a difficult choice, Cameron writes in a message on SuperCamps&#39; website, continuing, &quot;Fun, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it&#39;s a book that I enjoy reading to my kids because it always seems to give an image or a message that we have missed so far.&quot;
All well and good, except that the following paragraph, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, instead gives a synopsis of the 2012 film version, adding new characters and details to expand on the rather short original text.
&quot;Amid the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is gone and even air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree &quot;fulfilled&quot;, one reads. A love interest was Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel and who died in 1991, is completely unknown.
As if that weren&#39;t suspicious enough, the text provided by Cameron reads in part like the synopsis of that of the Lorax film presented on the Internet Movie Database website, beginning: &quot;In the walled city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.&quot;
While he admits he&#39;s a no-nonsense father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so unfamiliar with the book&#39;s plot. Here, an unnamed boy hears the local environment being ravaged by the money-hungry, tree-cutting, Thneed-knitting Once-ler, despite protests from the eponymous Lorax, a crouching, mustachioed creature &quot;who speaks on behalf of the trees.&quot;
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to a helper who hasn&#39;t read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text likely came from Cameron&#39;s constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed the text was provided by Cameron&#39;s staff, but made no other immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened with expulsion from England&#39;s squad but it&#39;s still tough
Facing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but given the squad England have chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat is not on my card.
I wouldn&#39;t rule out an away win.
Alastair Cook&#39;s side may be less experienced than three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting line-up and the community spirit is strong; they won&#39;t bear any scars from 2012, just a youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is developing as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if an unknown quantity at Test level, is an option for attack.
Related news: Adam Lyth is out of the England Test squad to be replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth out is obviously difficult for me, as his head coach at Yorkshire, to analyze.
In his seven Tests there were two good attacks in difficult conditions and the simple but harsh reality is that cricketers are results oriented.
There were no question marks with Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination because - and I said this earlier - players are their own best picks.
Long ago Lyth&#39;s course would have been lengthened, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully if he snags more runs for Yorkshire then another chance will come.
England manager Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude even if he didn&#39;t perform so well and I&#39;m not surprised; he is above all a team man.
The question of how much time a Test batsman is given to make his mark is a difficult one.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton got the chance to play home and away games.
The only reproach one can level was that England first used Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean - when Lyth was at his best - but that lost opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in and he&#39;s a hitter I rate highly.
He&#39;s an X Factor cricketer, which we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch, which hit us hard.
He must be given at least the same chances as the ones before him, but of course that depends on the team&#39;s line-up in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of having Moeen hit next to Cook, which would yield an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up and I don&#39;t mind.
I don&#39;t see why a batsman can&#39;t bat there and this left-hander has already shown he&#39;s one hotshot of a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for his Worcestershire County, but he&#39;s a number 3 for them and there&#39;s not much of a difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Tests on the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He did three hundred runs in an instant and didn&#39;t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner and in my limited dealings with him he really impressed me as a young man.
People might look at his stats -- an average of 31 with the stick and 35 with the ball -- and think it&#39;s a punt, but there aren&#39;t a huge number of backup spinners raising their hands and the coaches have opted for youth .
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the squad, England have made some smart additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as an adviser for the friendly could be a masterstroke.
He is one of the nicest guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience having played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood arrives for the cue ball phase of the tour, bringing energy and a powerful drive to the setup.
I&#39;ve always felt he was cut out for international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has insights from which we can benefit.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring a breath of fresh air, even if the news is consistent with what has been said before.
Colly&#39;s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, won&#39;t be used in the one-dayers, Root received a similar break against Australia and I personally don&#39;t have a problem with that.
While some will disagree, coaches and team builders don&#39;t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that like the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made lightly.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Great Britain leaving the EU) could gain support if the economy falls into a slump by 2017
David Cameron&#39;s half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU will run into deeper trouble by the day, even without the genius Jeremy&#39;s choice of &quot;Is it yes or no?&quot; Corbyn to lead Labor or the TUC, which clashed over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages too.
A European diplomat friend recently said that some member states, mired in various crises as the EU happens to be and not always through their own fault, are fed up with Britain&#39;s self-made agenda of fragmented concessions and disruptive treaty changes, most of which they don&#39;t want .
In Brighton, the TUC decided at their annual meeting that they don&#39;t like it either when they jeopardize social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George&#39;s selfie agenda.
Prime Ministers and Finance Ministers scramble to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, snap a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local notables, then come home and say they are winning allies for reform.
It&#39;s always about me.
My European friend who wants an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent - &quot;Don&#39;t leave us alone with France,&quot; says Berlin - and hints that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have gotten to that point where they don&#39;t care if we stay or go.
Germany&#39;s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before things look bad for her, as is the case with the overly long-stayers like Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) happened.
France&#39;s François Hollande looks ahead to re-election or replacement in 2017.
He is also a fading force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It&#39;s hard to imagine that they&#39;ll bend over backwards to help the Selfie Brits, whose energies would be better spent preventing Scotland&#39;s exit from the UK - something they don&#39;t want either, because most do have similar separatist tendencies.
So some such ministers may even be planning deliberately unhelpful SNP-style remarks during Britain&#39;s 2017 referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
&quot;The renegotiation was a bust&quot; and &quot;Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation.&quot;
Europeans know how rapacious Fleet Street can be at their expense and what Eurosceptics the oligarchy of press barons are, as they were not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum that defeated our entry in 1973 by a ratio of 2: 1 supported.
You may faintly remember Boris Johnson, the arch-euro opportunist who made his name as an &quot;EU-straight-bananas&quot; Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his weirdness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing scoundrels, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Actually, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but realized that when you&#39;re in a cage with a hot gorilla, it&#39;s better to hand out bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
Indeed, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron&#39;s referendum whirlwind, for Blair had placed the principle above the EU&#39;s unenacted constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving him a back door opened.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But the kind Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly slap on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he didn&#39;t need to waste any more time on me - seems in danger of abandoning Neil Kinnock&#39;s Boycott Murdoch strategy of the 1980s repeat, a mistake then and now.
It may take time but he needs to develop a coherent strategy to win over the media, not with me but certainly with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn&#39;s official position on Europe is, to put it mildly, evolving.
He says that we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, outside of UKip&#39;s traditional blue-dye leanings and the wilder realms of Tory&#39;s Little Englishmanism, most people can probably say yes to that.
It&#39;s what Hilary &quot;A Benn, but no Bennite&quot; said to Benn on radio and television this week as the Boy Scout in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn&#39;s appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his elderly father was on television trying to be disloyal to his Labor cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary&#39;s fight was even more attractive.
But fighting to stay &quot;at all costs&quot; - Benn&#39;s phrase - wasn&#39;t what McDonnell said, nor what by all accounts JC told his fellow campaigners and MPs at their Monday night retreat.
Whatever Corbyn&#39;s sob bottom-up image is trying to convey - remember it touched even me - news discipline remains important in the age of 24/7 TV and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It is right not to give Cameron a free pass to Europe, allowing him to take Labor&#39;s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn&#39;s fundamental ambiguity about EU membership - consistent with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among left-wing dissidents for whom the narcissism of small difference is a central tenet of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities on NATO - Tom Watson is adamant JC is not campaigning to leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to make sense of everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - making concessions to the British when it can all be pointless?
The US is already quite frustrated with weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost-cutting effort by the Tory government in power, I was reminded of at Monday&#39;s launch of what was called the British Influence Security Forum .
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
Claims by a state-funded agency that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking stemmed from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the &quot;policy report&quot; last month, describing it as a &quot;comprehensive review of the evidence.&quot;
But some researchers have questioned the robustness of the data, pointing to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the &quot;extraordinarily flimsy basis&quot; on which PHE based its key conclusion.
Writing in BMJ, two other researchers have asked whether the claims are &quot;built on rock or sand.&quot;
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool said: &quot;A fundamental principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness should.&quot;
They said the public expects PHE&#39;s claim that &quot;the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking&quot; to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single session of 12 people convened to develop a Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) model to express their opinions about the harms of different nicotine containing products to lead to a synthesis; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said one sponsor of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive is said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also underwrote BAT&#39;s public health credentials in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 attendees at the meeting said it was receiving funding from an e-cigarette maker but not the funding it was previously reported to have received from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for the selection of the panel members are not provided, but they include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also state industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their tobacco control expertise.
The PHE Tobacco Management also attended the meeting.
The group&#39;s research &quot;significantly admits&quot; that there is a lack of &quot;hard evidence for the harms of most products under most criteria,&quot; McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or limitations are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE&#39;s claims that &quot;there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes serve as a route for children or non-smokers to smoke&quot; were premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, PHE&#39;s director of health and well-being, said BMJ&#39;s claims had been previously acted upon.
He said: &quot;E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking.&quot;
One in two lifelong smokers die from their addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are small in comparison, but that we still have to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to educate the public about what the evidence shows and what does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting up-to-date evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
BBC should ditch EastEnders, says former Channel 4 boss
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would &quot;give their right arm&quot; to hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make the type of programs not broadcast by other UK broadcasters.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programmes, which are likely to be seen by smaller audiences, in fiercely contested time slots against the most popular shows from its rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations, Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully to get in touch with the BBC for six years while at Channel 4.
&quot;I have problems with the idea of the BBC commissioning or broadcasting programs that would also clearly be shown by unsubsidized rivals,&quot; Johnson told the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the BBC&#39;s future.
If you want to keep the license fee, which I don&#39;t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, at least put your production on programs that others don&#39;t make or commission.
They air The Voice in a prime time slot because they want to get the widest possible support for their future.
The idea that nobody else would show this is a joke, it&#39;s ridiculous, it&#39;s nonsense of course.
Johnson said: &quot;I don&#39;t see why a regressive tax would fund programs that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such programme, EastEnders is another, both admittedly self-produced.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I&#39;m striving to see what this public television is supposed to be like.
I don&#39;t think this would diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was to blame for chasing ratings &quot;because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they think it&#39;s the best way to go to secure long-term support.&quot;
His comments on the BBC&#39;s most popular shows echo what former Sky chief Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said the more niche public service programs &quot;should go to BBC4, where you pretty much can&#39;t measure audiences, but they get the job done and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical £4billion justification missions License fees go, &quot;Well, of course, we made all these obscure programs that nobody saw.&quot;
They put her in a time slot where no one ever wanted to see her.
On the license fee, Johnson told the committee: &quot;I challenge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think that for £150 a year you get great value here, but for people who think £150 is a lot of money I wonder if that&#39;s true because they don&#39;t consume much of it BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 boss David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;.
He said little of the BBC&#39;s production is now officially classified as education - he said it is 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on radio - and that it should appeal to public television in Australia and Australia Canada take an example, change this to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas such as the Proms, which he said only a handful are shown on TV, and form alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
&#39;Sonogenetics&#39; can control brain cells through sound waves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by bursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction the moment they are irradiated with sound pulses that have frequencies too high for human hearing to hear.
The impulses work by turning on motor neuron cells, which are genetically modified to carry membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on this topic: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said the worms demonstrated the power of a new technique, called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a range of brain, heart and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that delivers electrical pulses into people&#39;s brains to treat the symptoms of Parkinson&#39;s disease .
Roundworms don&#39;t typically respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they did when surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic air bubbles.
The bubbles, he found, amplify the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate the worms.
The amplified ultrasonic waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels found in the membranes of some of the worm&#39;s cells.
The sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are associated with, according to a report Nature Communications.
To create ultrasound-gated nematodes, Chalasani genetically engineered the worms so that some of their motoneurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the microbubbles and transmitted into the worms, where they turn on the altered motor neurons.
The technique shares some similarities with Optogenetics, a pioneering tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with pulses of light.
But Chalasani said Sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which must be sent down an optical fiber to the desired location in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissue unhindered and so can be launched into the brain from the top of the skull.
&quot;We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it is possible to make the targeted human neurons transiently vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments,&quot; Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right on your doorstep!
The ads are shaming Britain&#39;s arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International Anti-Guns Fair video.
Terrible Killer Drones!
Ankle crushing leg shackles!
cluster bombs!
And stun batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheery voice and cartoon imagery leave no doubt that this advert for the world&#39;s largest arms fair is a combative parody produced by Amnesty International to spotlight the UK Government&#39;s willingness to donate arms to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Center in London&#39;s Docklands.

But a separate campaign also results in many billboards seen at bus stops and on subway trains that require a second look.
&quot;Important announcement: Will you be traveling with DLR from September 15th to 18th?&quot; (Docklands Light Railway) can be read in the typefaces of the London Underground and the trademarks of the DLR line, which turns into an image of a tank.
In September, a swarm of arms dealers will be driving DLR... Customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksy&#39;s Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped with distribution in London, using &quot;Ad Space Hack Packs&quot;, a £6 pack of Allen keys which are claimed to &quot;give access to around a third of the bus stop ad space on the planet gain.&quot;
Transport for London does not find this poster &quot;vandalism&quot; amusing.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Curator of Crueol Designs and Lecturer at the University of Essex, artists will become more critical and seek to bring political work to audiences outside of galleries.
Many artists get to work with activists within protest movements, realizing that they need to get out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-arms trade posters greets commuters on the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was produced by advertising agency VCCP, who work for a charity with the graphic designer and voiceover artist, who also works for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence surrounding the gun show promotion - through a blank space on the ExCeL calendar - and thought, &quot;Let&#39;s give them the campaign they&#39;re trying to avoid.&quot;
They toyed with inventing a more realistic dodgy corporate ad, but &quot;bringing it in with bright colors and animation makes it stick more.&quot;
&quot;You have done a fantastic job helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,&quot; said Amnesty&#39;s Tom Davies.
What we need now is British Government action and a guarantee that torture devices are not being trafficked on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art around the gun show comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastically euphemistic products.

Eight golden rules for living in college dorms
Eleven years ago, I moved into a dorm as a self-absorbed 19-year-old, still believing in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the tight smiles of those I teased - and the numerous, lengthy complaints about others .
Most of what I&#39;ve learned can be distilled into eight simple rules.
Moving into dormitories ranges from mildly nerve-wracking to downright terrifying.
It&#39;s tempting to chatter: People tell you where you&#39;re from, if and where you took sabbatical, where you stand in relation to Corbyn, and why you &quot;honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it&#39;s just one Yeast extract HAHAHA I&#39;m in my room.&quot;
Take a deep breath.
And help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you figure out the people you like versus those you wouldn&#39;t talk to even if your eyelashes caught fire and they were fire extinguishers.
release people.
People&#39;s rooms often turn into drink reception desks, movie night venues, and community gathering places, but they&#39;re also the places where people get dressed and adjust their underwear.
Related: Don&#39;t think about starting a relationship at college
Introverts get rough treatment at college.
Your room should be a sanctuary, but many college dorms foster a room-to-room, strolling culture that&#39;s friendly, social, and can lead to lifelong friendships.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, &quot;I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I can get back the energy I expended interacting with you.&quot;
Try to sense when a fellow student is tired of socializing - and text them instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my dorms had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw some things.
Make Friends by Baking.
Since you&#39;re starting varsity at the height of baking mania, knocking on people&#39;s doors to introduce yourself with a plate full of brownies is less odd than the 1950s greeting, &quot;Welcome to the neighborhood, I got you something baked. So, and now please smile when I ask you a few personal questions.&quot;
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel compelled to chat and may end up associating your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed lumps of flour, sugar and fat make people pretend to be asleep when you knock.
Stealing groceries is a common crime in college dormitories.
Of course stealing chicken is stealing, but is taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are they will say to help themselves even if they are cooking inside.
When someone steals your stuff, it&#39;s annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to be more balanced about it than my roommate, who added dish soap to her milk to punish thieves.
She is in prison now.
You shouldn&#39;t make noise that distracts people from sleep or work.
It&#39;s not just about being a decent human being, it&#39;s about being one of those people who live in glass houses, as the saying goes.
A girl down my hall asked her neighbors if they would mind turning down the drum &amp; bass a bit because it was 3am and she had an exam in the morning.
They responded with even louder music.
When they finally quit at 5am, her neighbors kindly let her sleep for two more hours before she blared out her own music, locked her door, and headed for her three-hour exam.
Wouldn&#39;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same college dorm?
Conversely, wouldn&#39;t it be profoundly embarrassing if you mistook a roommate for your soon-to-be spouse, approach her, break up, and then have to see her every day and maybe see her drag all of your mutual friends over to you?
Heart goes its own way, of course - but if a hot roommate is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to talk some sense into your gut.
In that thrilling moment when you realize someone left their keys in their unlocked room, the line between prank and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good prank is funny, but it only takes moments before it boomerangs.
Teach a valuable and amusing safety lesson by hiding - but never mess up anyone&#39;s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock her door and put her keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don&#39;t staple her belongings to the ceiling more than twice.
Terraced houses for refugees, single parents, low earners
The real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds terraced houses for people who don&#39;t have much money in the central Franconian town of Eckental.
For example for refugees - but also as a signal: &quot;Not only refugees need living space, but also single mothers and low earners.&quot;
&quot;I show how you can still build cheaply and well today,&quot; says the 44-year-old in an interview
Thousands of refugees will enter the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner thinks he knows how quickly cheap living space can be created: in a project he is building terraced houses for refugees.
Mr Gildner, many refugees will be entering the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gymnasiums is not sustainable.
Because most of the people stay here.
In view of the influx of refugees, we will also need sufficient living space in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-storey terraced house is the solution.
Gildner: A terraced house takes up the least space.
It makes integration easier.
It&#39;s different when you house people in apartment blocks.
Each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each.
Each residential unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say, it&#39;s peace again, I&#39;m going back.
Then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184,000 euros, not including the land.
That&#39;s manageable.
Construction took six months.
That&#39;s appropriate.
Have building codes complicated your plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I went through my project correctly.
The threatening sword of Damocles special construction and the parking space ordinance always make it particularly complicated.
Gruesome.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a terraced house needs at least three parking spaces.
Only in the cities there is not enough space for this.
And refugees and asylum seekers don&#39;t have cars.
How did the residents react to your terraced house project?
Gildner: There were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
Which is definitely not true.
But aren&#39;t you intensifying the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It&#39;s true: We&#39;ve had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford anymore.
My project has the message that ordinary people also need living space.
Not only refugees, but also the single mother or the low earner.
I show how you can still build cheaply and well today.
It&#39;s all about this.

iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping on &quot;General&quot; and then choosing &quot;Software update&quot;.
When ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message saying &quot;Software update failed&quot;.
To work around the issue, users are advised to either wait for the onslaught to subside or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will walk you through the rest of the process.
That could potentially mean deleting apps to make room - but Apple has made that less likely by streamlining the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this if you use a dedicated tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is complete.
It&#39;s worth making sure your phone is charged or near a charger during the update so the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed as the phone may turn off midway and this could cause the update to abort.

You should also make sure you&#39;ve gone through our checklist of all things prior to your download to prevent things from going wrong and protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and tremendous new productivity features to iPad, as well as changes that speed up and fix the operating system.
Rosberg&#39;s only motto: full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the world title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: &quot;Full attack&quot;.
Before the start of the decisive seven overseas races, the World Championship runner-up emphasized &quot;that I have nothing left to lose&quot;.
Before the night race in Singapore this Sunday, 53 points separate the vice world champion from defending champion and two-time champion Hamilton.
The Briton has already won seven of the twelve races of the season so far and is also the favorite to tackle the floodlit Grand Prix in the city-state.
The 30-year-old Briton won the race in 2009 and last year.
It is still unclear whether the current smog in the city-state will have an impact on the Singapore Grand Prix.
A haze has been hanging over the city for days, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has one prominent member
The chess club &quot;Schachfreunde Bad Kissingen&quot;, which was founded three months ago, has added another member to its ranks, increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has been to Bad Kissingen more than 40 times for a cure.
Gauselmann bears the Federal Cross of Merit, 1st class, and is an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
Gauselmann supported the chess club in Bad Kissingen with a donation, which chairman Alfred Klein accepted.
This makes it possible to admit chess players who cannot afford the membership fee.
Youth work and the search for talent should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and friendly contact with the &quot;Rot-Weiss&quot; tennis club will be seen as an expression of his connection to the spa town.
The district office is looking for direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift old people&#39;s center have joined forces under the umbrella of the social foundation and opened a new contact point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also take part in courses there.
The social foundation is drawn down from the mountain to the city center.
To be more precise, at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
A new neighborhood office was recently opened there.
Here, right next to the supermarket, senior citizens and those seeking advice can now get information on questions such as long-term care insurance or the benefits of health and long-term care insurance.
For years we have noticed with our outpatient nursing service that caring relatives are often left alone.
There are endless questions.
&quot;It is also not uncommon for many health insurance services not to be used because the complexity of insurance is hardly understood anymore,&quot; explained the new landlady Jutta Weigand, who, as division manager for the elderly, is also responsible for the Antonistift and the Bürgerspital as well as for the outpatient service &quot;Amadeus &quot; responsible for.
In addition to advice, the new district office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
For this purpose, the Saludis was taken on board.
Therefore, you can use additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers from the senior center and the Saludis ideally complement each other.
Saludis stands for prevention, precaution and rehabilitation.
&quot;The senior center for care and nursing,&quot; said Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
Both managing directors see demographic change as the reason for opening the new district office in the city centre.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) emphasized at the inauguration celebrations, the district office is also dedicated to loneliness in old age: &quot;There are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite you to a regular social get-together&quot;.
In this way, the social foundation makes a major contribution to senior citizens being able to live as independently and well in their familiar surroundings as possible.
The district office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on October 6th
Now it&#39;s official: After the date for the game FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third division team Würzburger Kickers had not yet been set due to renovation work at the Fuchspark Stadium, October 6th has now been set as the date.
The match between FC Eintracht Bamberg in the round of 16 of the Bavarian Football Soccer Cup against the third division team FC Würzburger Kickers has now finally been scheduled.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6th at 7 p.m. in the Fuchsparkstadion in Bamberg.
&quot;We&#39;re happy that we now know when the game will take place, now we have planning security,&quot; said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points out that advance ticket sales have now started.
It&#39;s something special for our team to play against a third division team.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and not without reason, because floodlit games have a special attraction.
FC Eintracht Bamberg made it into the last 16 teams in 2010 by beating regional league club 1. FC Oberhaid (3-1) and at home against regional league club 1. FC Schweinfurt 05 (3-2).

Defending champion is third division relegated SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Viennese architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, as the Künstlerhaus announced on Tuesday.
With Mang, the Künstlerhaus is losing an honorary member and at the same time &quot;one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna,&quot; as the broadcast said.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna under Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
From 1952 he worked as a freelance architect, but was also active as a teacher, writer and director of institutes.
From 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Design Institute.
In the 1980s he was commissioned to set up the treasury in the Vienna Hofburg and to convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese throws money at the police officer
Ex-soccer player Tim Wiese was not noticed well in Bremen.
Once upon a time there was a footballer, now Tim Wiese, ex-national goalkeeper in Germany and with Bremen and Hoffenheim, is a wrestler.
According to his own statement, he wants to have gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years.
Intellectually, however, he has not increased.
Wiese was having his hair cut in downtown Bremen when he saw a parking lot attendant issuing a ticket for his white Chevrolet Camaro outside.
Wiese then stormed out of the shop, insulted the officer and threw the fine at her feet, as reported by the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper.
The city of Bremen confirms the allegations, but is not yet clear about the consequences of the unusual incident.
&quot;The matter is still being examined,&quot; says the city of Bremen.
Only then will it be decided whether meadow is displayed or not.
Panamanian authorities destroy 4,500 marijuana plants
The fertile soil and rainforest climate of Isla del Rey are ideal for marijuana plants to thrive.
For the past three days, the Panamanian authorities have been uprooting and burning the 4,500 plants.
Men beat up 17-year-old Afghans
The police are looking for witnesses to an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 11:45 p.m., three young men were walking from Bad Soden towards Salmünster.
According to the police, one of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called out to them to wait for him.
At this time the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people on the gas station premises.
One of these men yelled at the youth and hit him in the face with his fist.
The victim suffered a broken nose and was bleeding profusely from the nose.
When his two friends rushed over and talked soothingly to the thug, he initially let go of his victim.
The injured young man was brought home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and demonstratively drove past there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer visible, the injured man went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette.
There he was attacked again by the thug and another male person.
The victim&#39;s face and thighs were beaten with a baton.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical treatment.
So far there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second thug was said to be about 1.65 meters tall and was wearing jeans and a brown and white shirt.
The police are asking witnesses and whistleblowers to call 06181/100-123.
dr Frank Müller takes over the Felstehausen practice and invests 310,000 euros
Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from left) take over the practice from Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
Bernd Bormann, mayor of the joint municipality, Uta Seim-Schwartz, business promoter, and Asendorf&#39;s mayor, Heinfried Kabbert, are also happy about this.
In many places in the countryside there are no doctors - Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: Dr. Frank Müller left the Felstehausen practice on October 1st.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retiring, her husband Karl-Heinrich will support his successor with a part-time job for the next few months.
After a renovation phase, Müller will reopen the practice on October 12. Until then, he will have invested 310,000 euros in the premises at St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first sight when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll, who is currently completing her specialist training at the Verden hospital and also wants to start working in the practice next year.
&quot;We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice,&quot; says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
&quot;When the time came, I just called her.&quot;
The Müller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
&quot;The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us,&quot; says the 39-year-old Müller.
&quot;We would like to get to know and accompany the families over the years&quot;.
He also sees being his own boss as an advantage.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
They will continue to live in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Frank Müller, father of two, also grew up there, and after his medical studies in Hanover he worked in several medical practices and in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
He is currently working as a senior physician in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed senior emergency physician in the Diepholz district and is a volunteer in the DRK on-call service in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
From September 19th, the practice for the new boss will be prepared.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a general practitioner, his wife Ursel (internist) has specialized in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to establish themselves as general practitioners.
&quot;That&#39;s why endoscopy comes out,&quot; says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the reconstruction, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need one more consulting room.
In addition, the EDP will be completely renewed.
The Müllers receive a subsidy totaling 50,000 euros as part of a support program from the district (25,000 euros), the joint municipality (12,500 euros) and the municipality (12,500 euros).
&quot;This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is being continued,&quot; emphasizes joint municipality mayor Bernd Bormann.
According to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, around 2,000 patients come to the Felstehausen practice every quarter, compared to around 500 in the average practice in northern Germany.
There is another general practice in Asendorf.
A positive side effect of Frank Müller taking over the practice: According to Ursel Felstehausen, the pharmacy will remain in Asendorf.
If no successor had been found, she would have gone too.
By the way, anyone who visits Müller&#39;s office hours will continue to see familiar faces in particular: they will take over the seven medical assistants and the cleaning staff from the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
&quot;In the beginning we only had two rooms,&quot; Ursel Felstehausen remembers with a smile.
She already feels a little nostalgia after such a long time.
&quot;But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will certainly see many patients more often,&quot; says the internist.
Her husband adds with a laugh: &quot;We have a 6,000 square meter property.&quot;
&quot;So far I&#39;ve always avoided gardening, but now that could be different.&quot;
The couple also has two grandchildren and likes to travel.
Croatia: &quot;We let the refugees through&quot;
&quot;Now the border controls are also being ramped up on our southern border,&quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner.
The controls at the Hungarian border will remain in place at the same time.
It is still clear that anyone who wants to apply for asylum can do so &quot;of course&quot;.
The care and safety of people is the priority.
But it is also clear &quot;that clear signals are needed,&quot; said the minister.
People need to know that we do not accept borderless migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It needs a controlled approach.
Croatia considers &quot;corridor&quot; - Slovenia refuses
The Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to allow incoming refugees to continue their journey towards Austria and Germany and, under certain circumstances, also wanted to build corridors for the refugees.
However, Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Ljubljana did not see it that way.
The idea of corridors is &quot;absolutely unacceptable&quot;, Slovenia will in fact intensify the surveillance of the border - especially to Hungary.
The border with Croatia, on the other hand, is already heavily controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area.
As the minister emphasized, Slovenia does not want to seal off its borders for refugees.
&quot;Each EU member must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system cannot function,&quot; stressed Györkos Znidar.
As the Croatian government announced, the first refugees tried to enter eastern Croatia at the Tovarnik/Sid border crossing during the night on Tuesday in order to avoid registration.
The Croatian police were able to pick them up in the nearby corn fields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have been arriving in Tovarnik, Croatia, since then.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are already in action.
In the coming days, his country is expecting around 4,000 refugees, said Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be diverted towards Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media reported unanimously on Wednesday.
However, the government in Belgrade denied that it was their job to instruct people to take certain routes: &quot;We neither can nor want to do this,&quot; it said.
According to media reports, the first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid early in the morning, and more buses are expected during the day.
Via Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been traveling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border around 500 kilometers away.
&quot;We heard that Hungary closed, so the police told us to go here,&quot; said one of the refugees.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could now actually result in the shift of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a route a little further west, as already predicted by observers.
Croatia: &quot;Comprehensive options for border control&quot;
Croatia&#39;s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously emphasized that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a large influx of refugees.
He didn&#39;t give any details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has &quot;comprehensive border control options.&quot;
Strict checks are carried out to qualify for Schengen membership.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, and since then the EU partners have consistently given the country good marks in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, around 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to media reports in Belgrade, they spent the previous night at the Horgos border crossing, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
It is still unclear whether the remaining refugees want to continue to the Croatian border.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic tried to calm people down during a local inspection in Horgos on Wednesday morning: He considers the debates about alternative routes for refugees to be premature now that the Hungarian border is closed.
The number of refugees would not be very high at the moment.
It is not yet possible to say whether they will continue their journey via Hungary, Croatia or another country.
Helpers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugee helpers have already started distributing maps to the refugees showing alternative routes through Croatia.
However, crossing the border between Serbia and Croatia is not without its dangers: In parts of the border area there are still minefields that have not been cleared, even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a demining team had been dispatched to the border region.
Stock market hackers: Ukrainians pay 30 million dollars
Supranonok is believed to be part of a cybercriminal ring accused of hacking unpublished financial reports and press releases from websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
Insider deals are said to have been made on the financial markets with the information stolen.
According to the investigators, a total of over 100 million dollars were stolen in this way.
&quot;Today&#39;s comparison shows that even those outside our national borders are ultimately caught,&quot; the SEC statement said.
The trials of 32 other suspects in the case continued.
Most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are said to have acted both in the USA and in Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospice Aid Mannheim has been in existence for 20 years
There is a lot of activity around the Mannheim Paradeplatz.
People do their errands, sometimes at a fast pace, sometimes leisurely strolling.
You head for the two stations of the Mannheim Autosalon on Paradeplatz.
light rail stop.
Vibrant, full life in glorious autumn sunshine and in the middle of it all four large plaques each with the heading &quot;I want to die before I die&quot;....
With this campaign, the Ecumenical Hospice Aid draws attention to its 20th anniversary and is confronted with mixed reactions.
&quot;It&#39;s about life, so we went into the middle of the city and among the people with the campaign,&quot; says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the ecumenical hospice aid is available to passers-by for questions and discussions, as are the volunteers.
While many a passer-by spontaneously grabs a piece of chalk and adds &quot;affirm my life&quot;, &quot;be able to read&quot;, &quot;drive a camper through the USA&quot;, &quot;stop the war&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t suffer long&quot;, others stop for a moment , read, say sentences like &quot;I&#39;m not that far yet&quot; and then move on.
Again and again small discussions about the action itself, about life, dealing with death develop on the sidelines.
Peter Hübinger is also on site.
&quot;Only when I realize that the end of this world will come for me at some point can I live responsibly,&quot; says the director of the Diakonisches Werk Mannheim, which, together with the Caritas Association, is the sponsor of the ecumenical hospice aid.
Therefore, this high-profile campaign for the 20-year-old is good.
However, it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, after all it is a very personal matter.
The subject of death and dying is still taboo, according to Josefine Lammer&#39;s experience, although the hospice movement in particular has contributed a lot in recent years to people opening up.
An assessment shared by Angelika Godefroid.
The dying and bereavement companion is one of the volunteer employees from the very beginning.
Confronted with the topic through personal experience, she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in euthanasia.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Aid called for volunteers, she immediately got in touch and was there when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - who support those affected and their families in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the Saint Vincent hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid is good at her job and the experiences she has made.
&quot;I see life from a different perspective, I think it&#39;s precious and appreciate the moment,&quot; she says.
The outpatient ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and non-denominational.
The financial support of the health insurance companies and donations from relatives and associations enables the training and further education and supervision of the death and bereavement attendants.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The panels described on Saturday are now on display in the Evangelical Church building (M1, 1a) and in the Catholic Church building (F2, 6).
There, too, further personal wishes can be noted on postcards.
FedEx results mixed, 2016 financial outlook downgraded
FedEx reports disappointing results for its most recent quarter, and the shipping giant cut its profit outlook to a full year on weaker demand for freight services and higher costs at its ground transportation service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for vacations.
At this point last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before Wednesday&#39;s open.
fedex corp said it would earn a profit of between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from the earlier forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite price hikes, which average 4.9 percent and take effect on January 4, and higher surcharges for ground transport of heavy and large packages, which will come into effect from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to improve year-on-year on cost cutting, higher revenue and growth in online retail.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company is &quot;delivering solid earnings considering weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade.&quot;
The plans for the holiday job were announced a day later than rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, about the same number as last year.
For the quarter ended Aug. 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent year-over-year.
Earnings per share were $2.42 per share, just below the $2.44 per share predicted by 12 analysts polled by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts polled by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has seen a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused revenue at its express shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In its most recent quarter, ground transportation revenue rose 29 percent, but operating income was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and auto-insurance.
The Express unit reported higher revenue due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before the open, FedEx shares were down $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They ended Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists are spending two days this week seated around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table to decide whether it&#39;s time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A mural of the United States looms over them at one end of the ornate, two-story boardroom.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the nation&#39;s economic interests above all else.
The Fed has a dual mandate from Congress: maximize US employment and keep prices here stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too narrow to predict. It will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to start being weaned from the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Although most data on the economy shows that it is growing solidly, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed officials fearful of amplifying that volatility by raising Bund yields -- if only by a quarter percentage point.
&quot;Obviously, the primary thing they&#39;re going to watch is the labor market and inflation,&quot; said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus &amp; Co.
&quot;But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to hike interest rates, the heightened uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait,&quot; she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself is unsettling the financial market.
About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg have predicted a rate hike this week.
However, financial markets are expecting a wait-and-see for the Fed, with a key indicator showing only a 30% chance of a hike.
This suggests the stock market will fall if the Fed hikes rates unless strategists soften the blow by promising that another hike is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The action was prompted by expectations that Fed policy would keep rates up this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody&#39;s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed hiked rates at this point,&quot; he said.
If she does, &quot;she would have to go very far in her statement to reassure financial markets that they don&#39;t panic.&quot;
Other pundits argued that a rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed appeared on track to hike rates by 0.25 percentage point this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected the rate to rise this year, despite complaints from Liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labor market this year has been solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and near what the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And although inflation has remained consistently below the central bank&#39;s 2% target for the year, Fed officials said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy &quot;can handle higher interest rates and needs it because of the tightening job market,&quot; said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world twitched late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial average fell more than 16% from its peak in May as investors feared a slowdown in China&#39;s economy would choke global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat this month, with the Dow now down almost 10% from the May high.
For Fed officials, the market turmoil is affecting the complex calculation of when to raise rates.
&quot;If the events in financial markets and the news of weakness in the Chinese economy hadn&#39;t occurred over the past few weeks, they would be tightening the reins at this session,&quot; said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at UCLA&#39;s Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve employee.
Now he predicts she will wait at least a month to get a better handle on the effects.
&quot;There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China,&quot; Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed&#39;s primary concerns, so technically it shouldn&#39;t be involved in its decision-making.
But the bottom line is that the Fed has become the monetary authority of the world.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
Then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke&#39;s mere suggestion in 2013 that the Fed could &quot;tighten&quot; its monetary expansion sparked confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly interdependent, Fed officials can be expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere, but also to consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the sustain global economy.
Their decision-making is &quot;more art than science,&quot; said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy for wealth management at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., noted this month that &quot;the Fed has a history of overreacting to financial market moves that appear unrelated to economic fundamentals.&quot;
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee that campaigns for a rate hike, cited decisions in 1998-1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia led the Fed to cut interest rates by 0.75 percentage points in three meetings &quot;despite a limited discernible impact on US growth,&quot; Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should only prioritize financial stability issues during a major crisis like the 2008 market meltdown, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England&#39;s Rate Setting Committee.
The recent turmoil doesn&#39;t come close to that level, he said.
&quot;She certainly doesn&#39;t want to get into the situation where she&#39;s afraid of a rate hike because the markets are upset,&quot; said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has the dual mandate and makes no mention of financial stability and until that is changed I don&#39;t think it should be ahead of the curve.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, it is in Chinatown and not in Thai Town.
The market/warehouse is a one-stop shop, offering a bewildering array of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and crockery, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There&#39;s even an auto department if you need motor oil.
The store is huge and it takes over an hour to wander the aisles.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there&#39;s a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food stall (good and inexpensive) in this store is near the cash registers and has various take-away options.
What&#39;s here: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and local Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is extensive, as is the fish counter - staff behind the counter will clean and fillet the fish and even roast it for you if requested.
A good chunk of the store belongs to the massive freezer department. You&#39;ll find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galangal, whole duck, fish, beef blood and bile, natural pork casings, fish balls, local sausage, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who shops here: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as individual families and individuals.
The wide aisles are suitable for shopping trolleys and forklifts.
You will find here: fresh monthong durian next to the cash register.
Where it&#39;s located: The store is in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even if the store is busy, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life support for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany these days.
Giving you a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who selflessly support asylum seekers in the city.
Among them are Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
Even at the age of 74, she still enjoys teaching.
She does it every Thursday in the home for asylum seekers on Dillinger Strasse.
There she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language.
Of course, this is very different from teaching at a real school.
Brazil&#39;s Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is a shocking attempt to educate women about the importance of good nutrition while breastfeeding. She does this by presenting images of babies suckling breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by approximately 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake isn&#39;t the only dietary adjustment moms should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that healthy eating in pregnant women actually affects their babies&#39; genes and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet in the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder sports hall
The municipal council of Bernried approved the building application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof may be flatter for solar systems.
The planning for the long-awaited construction of the gymnasium at the Bernried sports grounds is progressing step by step: at the most recent municipal council meeting, the planning application was unanimously approved without much discussion.
The committee had previously decided, among other things, to apply for an &quot;exception&quot; or &quot;exemption&quot; from the valid development plan under building law.
The &quot;exception&quot; was about permission for a special shape with regard to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a &quot;saddle roof with a non-central ridge and roof overhang&quot; is to be erected.
The background to the planning is the intended use of the roof area for solar systems: &quot;This will give us a wonderfully large south-facing roof,&quot; Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The &quot;liberation&quot; was again about the roof pitch, which for energy reasons - contrary to what is stipulated in the development plan - should be less than ten degrees.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
An &quot;exemption&quot; was necessary because the development plan does not allow any &quot;exceptions&quot; with regard to the pitch of the roof - although the Bernried municipal council is generally rather restrictive when it comes to applications for exemption.
However, the construction of the gym is not a recurring project: &quot;We are not creating a precedent with this,&quot; says Steigenberger.
The construction of the gymnasium at the sports center is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
The costs are around 2.3 million euros.
Subsidies are expected from school and mass sports funding.
In the next step of the process, the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the district office for examination.
Klinik Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and most of the employees are moving from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is what the surprising plans of the district hospital GmbH, which district administrator Andrea Jochner-Weiss confirmed.
However, the supervisory board will make a decision on this, and it will meet next Wednesday, September 23rd.
If the plans are implemented, all of the almost 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to be employed.
The vast majority should move to Schongau with Fischer and the existing inner station.
The rooms are available.
According to Jochner-Weiss, employees who cannot come to Schongau should be offered a job in Weilheim.
Employees have been informed of the plans.
The change was triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been Medical Director of the Schongau Clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When it came to the question of who should succeed him, according to Jochner-Weiss, the name &quot;Fischer&quot; came into play, who agreed to take over the management from October 1st and move to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case an &quot;upgrading&quot; and a broadening of the offer in the field of &quot;internal medicine&quot;, according to Jochner-Weiss.
Fischer is a specialist in cardiac pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) specializes in gastroenterological diseases on the inner ward.
If the supervisory board agrees, Fischer and his team will run both houses temporarily for the next two years, until next year the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, is to be finally closed in Peißenberg after almost 140 years .
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing renovation of the Weilheim Hospital has been completed.
District Administrator Jochner-Weiss, who is also Chair of the Supervisory Board, countered rumors that the house, which is owned by the Federal Miners&#39; Association, is to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers in the future.
&quot;I rule that out&quot;. Jochner-Weiß could not say how the property would continue, there were several considerations.
Short-term care from Caritas and day psychiatry are currently housed there.
&quot;Nothing better could have happened to us, such an opportunity will not come again,&quot; says Fischer about the virtual move to the Lech, which was received &quot;positively and very understandingly&quot; by the employees.
There was no real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for over 30 years.
He was asked by Schongau colleagues to take over the post of medical director.
The Peißenberg hospital (once 100 beds) has repeatedly been threatened with closure in recent decades, departments have been closed, for example surgery and obstetrics.
The handball players of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are challenged tonight (8.15 p.m.) at the Bergisches HC.
The Bundesliga leaders are the clear favorites in Wuppertal, but there is no reason to be arrogant.
Last season, the Badeners suffered a painful defeat at the BHC and have something to make up for there.
Hunting accident with two injured near Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunshots during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the harvest in a corn field near Pratau (Wittenberg district), several hunters were in action, the police said.
After a shot was fired, a 63- and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
It was initially unclear how exactly the accident could have happened.
The criminal police are investigating.
Missing 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate Victim of violent crime
A suspect led the police to the body of the 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who had been missing since Saturday.
During interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenager and throwing her body into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rhineland-Palatinate who has been missing since Saturday has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The young woman&#39;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, as prosecutors and police announced on Wednesday.
The suspect is a 20-year-old who was also arrested on Tuesday evening, who reportedly confessed to the crime and led investigators to the location of the body.
The 16-year-old was reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home as agreed the night before after attending an autumn festival in Rockenhausen.
When searching for the young woman, investigators first found the victim&#39;s personal belongings.
When questioning the friends and acquaintances of the missing person, there was a suspicion that the 20-year-old had committed a crime.
The alleged perpetrator then led police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
According to the authorities, the arrested man admitted to the police questioning that he had killed the 16-year-old and put the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was to be brought before the magistrate on Wednesday, and investigators charged him with manslaughter.
Further investigations should shed light on the circumstances of the crime.
Refugees need accommodation: Study warns of housing shortage
The situation on the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for an affordable place to stay.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun.
With the arriving refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are crowding into a market that is already overburdened in many large cities.
They compete with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
In order to meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units would have to be built every year until 2020.
This is the result of a study commissioned by the &quot;Social Housing Construction&quot; alliance.
For comparison: 260,000 units will be completed in Germany this year.
This means that 140,000 apartments are missing.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer obliged to live in an initial reception center as asylum seekers.
Many then come across the housing market and join the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Statistical Office, however, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in rented accommodation last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees.
The study also identifies significant shortcomings in housing policy in recent years.
Germany has a housing deficit that is getting bigger every year.
Matthias Günther, author of the study, complains that around 770,000 residential units are currently missing in the metropolitan areas.
Many working people therefore had to live in shared apartments in big cities.
Due to the slump in the housing market, young adults involuntarily stayed longer in &quot;Hotel Mama&quot;.
In the big cities, the number of square meters per capita has fallen again for the first time in recent years.
In order to solve the problem, the &quot;social housing&quot; alliance proposes a new start.
New incentives are intended to boost social housing construction again.
For example, the real estate transfer tax could be waived and the real estate tax for subsidized apartments could be suspended for a limited period.
According to the alliance, attractive tax depreciation options are also necessary.
The support program for refugee accommodation from the state bank KfW is already being well received by cities and municipalities.
A good week after the start, more than half of the approximately 300 million euros available had already been called up on Monday evening with 184 million euros.
Now the project could even be scaled up.
Refugees have safe conduct: Croatia and Slovenia set up a corridor
It is practically impossible to get through to Hungary, as more and more refugees are choosing the route via Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow transit through Slovenia to the north without any hurdles.
However, the route is still dangerous.
Croatia wants to reach an agreement with neighboring Slovenia about setting up a corridor for refugees.
&quot;I spoke to the Slovenian Interior Minister and if necessary we will organize a corridor,&quot; Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone.
The EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country.
After the Serbian-Hungarian border was sealed off, hundreds of refugees set out for Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there.
The Croatian television station RTL reports that 500 people crossed the border near Tovarnik.
Hungary had sealed off its border to refugees the day before.
Moreover, new laws that came into force on the same day make regular asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic stated: &quot;You can travel through and we are preparing for this possibility.&quot;
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and achieve something.
However, they are people who do not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police picked up the first refugees on Serbia&#39;s border with the EU neighboring country Croatia in the morning.
According to media reports, most came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They came to the Serbian border town of Sid by both bus and taxis.
Immediately after their arrival, they tried to cross the green border into Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, the refugees do not come across border fences.
But the border strip harbors other dangers: there are still live mines from the Yugoslav civil war in the 1990s.
Mine clearers should now quickly create a safe passage.
Hardly any refugees come to Hungary after the border is closed.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the gate closed on Monday, there were still 9,380.
The new Hungarian laws classify overcoming and damaging the border fence as a criminal offence.
35 criminal proceedings were therefore initiated in the southern Hungarian border town of Szeged.
Those convicted face prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authorities, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established &quot;transit zones&quot; at the border, almost all of them - 93 - at the most important Röszke crossing.
Among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people.
On Wednesday morning, 40 refugees were still there.
In practice, however, no one has a chance of being granted asylum in Hungary.
According to Hungary, Serbia is a &quot;safe third country&quot;.
The rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there.
Only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot;transit zone&quot; in Röszke.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning up.
They collected the rubbish that tens of thousands of people had left on the side of the road in the past few weeks.
Barriers were dismantled and one of the reception camps in the border town was rebuilt.
Nobody wanted to comment on the goal of this conversion.
After the border between Serbia and Hungary was closed, only a few refugees reached Austria.
The country has also tightened its border controls.
According to the government, around 20,000 migrants are still in the country.
Around 1,400 people are waiting in Salzburg for the onward journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the instructions of the German authorities.
In Freilassing, small groups of refugees regularly arrived on foot.
Mayor drove &quot;stranded&quot; across the border
&quot;We were busy cleaning up after the bridge festival on Sunday when suddenly ten people with suitcases were standing at the entrance to the tent,&quot; said Wernstein&#39;s mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to go to Passau by train.
Because Germany surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday due to the influx of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein,&quot; said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and chauffeured the stranded people along with two other helpers and their cars across the border to nearby Passau .
Before that, we fed the unexpected guests with snacks and drinks.
We said right away that we would take her to Passau by car.
&quot;That was a matter of course for us,&quot; said Stadler in the OÖN interview.
They were very grateful.
A man insisted on handing over a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire brigade.
&quot;We were very happy about that,&quot; said Stadler.
The stranded train passengers had switched from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau on Sunday evening in Wels in order to try to cross the border after the short-notice announcement that rail traffic to Germany had been discontinued.
However, the regional train was parked in front of the border in Wernstein am Inn.
Cross-border activities are generally very popular in Wernstein.
The bridge festival connected socially with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday, the day before a sporty Zweibrückenlauf - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
The fact that Viktor Orbán is now sending tens of thousands more to us is a logical result of hypocritical politics:
Instead of immediately helping to set up structures in the Röszke camp that would guarantee humanity, our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly placed the attitude of the Hungarian government in the orbit of National Socialism.
Those Austrians who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas are not the only victims of this policy.
Refugees, too, will find that the &quot;promised land&quot; that invited and welcomed them is just another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, in view of the continuing stream of refugees and the approaching winter, to create decent conditions for those seeking protection.
And it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad on the search for 35,000 winter quarters
Konrad has his hands full with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word carries weight.
The government used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees.
Konrad has already got the chaos in the Traiskirchen reception center under control.
&quot;We no longer have any homeless people in Traiskirchen,&quot; he reported on his first success.
The accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also done without any fuss, said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot;masterpiece&quot;.
The Ministry of the Interior, however, spoke of a &quot;crisis situation&quot;.
Overall, Konrad expects a need of 85,000 quarters this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to be provided by the federal states and 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
&quot;But it&#39;s not a bottomless pit,&quot; said Konrad.
He has already held talks with the provincial governors.
They had assured him that they would also create quarters for the coming refugees.
&quot;Things are going well in Upper Austria,&quot; said Ferry Maier.
The former VP mandate supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to find out how the church will help.
The asylum coordinator also has great expectations of the ORF campaign &quot;Helfen wie wir&quot;.
Private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform.
In addition, one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as &quot;very high&quot;.
In times of need, it cannot be the case that accommodation providers have to maintain a certain height for the towel rails or the size of the skylights.
&quot;Emergency standards&quot; would have to apply for a limited time.
Konrad uses his experience to justify the fact that, in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior, he is more successful in finding accommodation.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not easily told an untruth to his face.
The power of persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not cause the republic any costs, as they themselves explained.
They want to increase their number of employees to three or four.
Their own search for accommodation has not yet been successful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container on Stephansplatz as an office.
But apparently there are problems with the permit.
Linz demands a better division
For the time being, the city of Linz is not planning to open municipal sports halls and other buildings such as the Tips Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees.
This is not necessary at the moment because the people affected can currently be accommodated without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In the event of an emergency, however, other locations should be checked for their suitability.
The mayor criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other districts also have to make their contribution here.
Seehofer: &quot;Borders are not sealed off&quot;
In a lengthy telephone call with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) on Monday, Governor Josef Pühringer (VP) agreed on how to proceed with the refugee issue.
Seehofer has assured me that the German borders will not be sealed off.
The onward journey of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible.
However, there are now the corresponding border controls.
There will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany on regular trains.
Pühringer once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue from the other EU member states.
The fact that Austria is now reintroducing controls at its borders is, for Pühringer, &quot;a logical consequence&quot; of the actions taken by the Germans.
The next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general refurbishment of the &quot;Neue Werft&quot; in Linz&#39;s Industriezeile is officially complete.
The listed IT group S&amp;T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building, the rest (2700 square meters) is to be rented to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
&quot;In IT, the bright minds are our raw material - and we have to try to get them to work for us,&quot; says S&amp;T boss Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in startup companies at Neue Werft and acquiring some later.
S&amp;T wanted to cooperate with its new neighbors right from the start - which Niederhauser has high hopes for: &quot;The next Runtastic is only a matter of time&quot;.
1.7 million euros were invested in the location by S&amp;T, 3.3 million euros by the Techcenter, which is owned by the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG) one third each.
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&amp;T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30 percent of the remaining 2,700 square meters of space in the building have already been rented, and there are inquiries for a further 40 percent.
Lia Peroni owner opened a second shop in the arcade
Furla handbags are the focus of the new shop.
Jutta Breit actually wanted to get a dog.
The 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in Taubenmarkt-Arkade had to postpone this project without further ado: After all, she has now grown in the form of another shop.
In the Furla shop opposite the store, where she sells bags, suitcases, shoes and clothing from various manufacturers, everything now revolves around women&#39;s handbags from the Furla brand, purses are available from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new shop has been in operation since yesterday.
Previously it was remodeled several weeks.
&quot;But I thought long and hard about opening another shop,&quot; says Breit.
One of the decisive factors in the decision was that the Furla producers, who are based in Bologna, were also impressed by the idea of having their own location where only their handbags are sold.
&quot;We are the only ones in the Linz area who sell this brand,&quot; says the mother of two daughters, who herself has Italian roots.
Breit inherited her interest in fashion from her mother.
I like it best when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Even the specialist cannot answer with absolute certainty why some women go into raptures at the sight of a beautiful handbag.
Maybe it&#39;s because a nice bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
Donald Trump&#39;s Palatinate ancestors came from a place whose inhabitants are called show-offs.
Some also associate this quality with the billionaire who wants to become US President.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for excitement.
Whether he makes xenophobic comments, is rude to journalists or reveals gaps in his knowledge of international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidency stirs up the election campaign.
And does well at it.
This is also registered in Kallstadt, Palatinate, where the grandparents of the real estate billionaire come from.
The New Yorker with the blow-dried hairstyle is well-known to many in the wine-growing village on the Wine Route.
Some people in the 1200-inhabitant town are related to him over umpteen corners.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Palatinate: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
The Kallstadt resident Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think of his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
&quot;I think they find it exciting in a way, but aren&#39;t that deeply impressed in their Kallstadt way,&quot; says Simone Wendel.
Born in Kallstadt, she made an amusing documentary about the place and its famous offspring, which include Trump and the Heinz ketchup family.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also has his say in &quot;Kings of Kallstadt&quot; (2014) - with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he lived in Kallstadt.
He didn&#39;t make it there to become the king of hearts.
Although there is respect for the family&#39;s achievements, there is also a tendency for the opinion that Trump is &quot;a bit of a loudmouth,&quot; says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has around is &quot;Die Brulljesmacher&quot; - in High German: the show-offs, she says.
So Trump comes from the village of braggarts.
Trump&#39;s success story began in 1885 when his future grandfather emigrated and opened a bar for gold diggers in the USA.
The cornerstone of the real estate group was the first property purchases in New York.
But the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy: their desire to return home permanently failed because of the Bavarian state, to which the Palatinate belonged at the time.
The director of the Institute for Palatinate History and Folklore, Roland Paul, said at the start of the film that he didn&#39;t include Trump because he once ran away without permission.
Trump is the grandson of an &quot;illegal emigrant&quot;.
This is in contrast to the sometimes pithy statements of the descendant.
He had repeatedly spoken disparagingly about Mexican immigrants in the United States and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
&quot;The way he rumbles, it&#39;s not so sympathetic,&quot; says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump (&quot;Grandma was born Trump, grandpa was born Heinz&quot;).
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distantly, &quot;he&#39;s always so short-tempered&quot;.
Does he think Trump is coming?
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine that,&quot; says the 72-year-old.
&quot;He never cared about Kallstadt&quot;.
The innkeeper Veronika Schramm mentions, like many Kallstadt residents, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which was generally well received.
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine Donald doing that,&quot; says the 68-year-old.
She thinks it would be better if he didn&#39;t win the election, because &quot;he has such radical views, I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good thing&quot;.
If those who ruled the United States in his grandfather&#39;s day were like him, &quot;he would never have gotten there.&quot;
&quot;There are more interesting topics than him,&quot; says vintner&#39;s daughter Sarah Bühler.
And as President?
&quot;It&#39;s not my president,&quot; she says.
And: &quot;The grapes will be ripe even without President Trump&quot;.
Wendel&#39;s film, for which Trump was interviewed at length, has seen 12,000 moviegoers, and interest is also growing in the United States.
The Upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany&#39;s first &quot;mountaineering village&quot;.
On Wednesday, the 1800-inhabitant village in the Berchtesgaden National Park received the award for gentle tourism from the Vice President of the German Alpine Club, Ludwig Wucherpfennig.
There are already 20 &quot;Mountaineering Villages&quot; in Austria.
In the neighboring country, the local Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A &quot;mountaineering village&quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants.
At least one fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven&#39;s Sunrise dominates the ratings despite Nine&#39;s attempts to recoup the loss of leadership on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report in the wake of the Liberals&#39; loss of leadership, but it hasn&#39;t yielded much in the ratings shift for Today.
Nine&#39;s breakfast show was being broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to topple Tony Abbott.
Rival Sunrise, with presenters David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long streak of international television shows that also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This distance disadvantage did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers across the five capitals compared to Today&#39;s 339,000.
Today scored a slight increase from Monday&#39;s (317,000) and last Tuesday&#39;s (283,000) ratings, but its number fell short of last Thursday&#39;s (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today averaged 318,000 compared to Sunrise&#39;s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ran between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise is averaging 349,000 viewers to Today&#39;s 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these morning people more than Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for checking!

The big news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to settle down on the New Zealand coast with his two children, garnered a very impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could carry a hit show solo without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Yesterday&#39;s result answered this with a clear &quot;yes&quot;.
Seven&#39;s The X-Factor stayed strong with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on night two of The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (5:00pm to 5:30pm) of the new quiz show, hosted by Andrew O&#39;Keefe, averaged 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (5:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small win over Eddie McGuire&#39;s hot-seat (613,000).
On Monday night, The Chase Australia&#39;s first half hour drew 520,000 viewers and the second half drew a whopping 720,000.
Hot seat average 620,000.
The drop in odds on The Chase Australia&#39;s second night will give Nine confidence that hot-seat will ultimately prevail at 5:30pm.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for Million Dollar Minute which failed to outperform The McGuires Show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
secret revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who wins The Bachelor.
The woman Sam Wood ends up with in The Bachelor has been shrouded in the utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before three becomes two, you may have inadvertently given a hint as to who the victor will be.
Sam Wood is keeping his lips tightly sealed until Thursday&#39;s finale
All three women have lyrically opened up about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to partner with him.
However, when the question is asked, &quot;If not you, who should receive Wood&#39;s final rose?&quot;, their answers could spoil the game as to who won the Bachelor&#39;s heart.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were both quick to name - besides themselves - Mackay as the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship since day one.
&quot;From the moment I walked into the house and noticed [Sarah&#39;s] and Sam&#39;s energies, I felt like they were quite compatible, and I&#39;ve felt that throughout the show,&quot; said Jeavons-Fellows.
&quot;Sarah is down to earth, so much fun to be with,&quot; added Markoski.
I&#39;ve seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
You feel pleasant and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said last week&#39;s home visit made her realize that Wood could be &quot;the one&quot;.
&quot;As soon as I saw him with my friends and family I realized that obviously this isn&#39;t just a game - I&#39;m totally tuned into him now,&quot; she said.
And when asked who Wood should vote for if not her, she was puzzled.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if I can say that,&quot; she said.
I love the leftover girls equally - it&#39;s a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on Ten.

Detroit and Seattle showed keen interest after his move to the US - and there were plenty of other teams who sent in inquiries after his impressive open practice day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have benched Hayne for the remainder of the game when he lost a scramble like the Aussie Rugby League convert did on his first punt return in Tuesday&#39;s 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his man and gave Hayne the next opportunity for a punt return and also into the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula continued to show his true colors in the post-match dressing room.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne in his post-game press conference.
49ers sportscaster Cam Inman reported that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his botched catch and get on with the next game.
Jarryd Hayne fumbles on a punt recovered by the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter
It certainly wasn&#39;t the start that Hayne and his massive Aussie following were hoping for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field cursing after the fumble and later told Australian radio duo Hamish &amp; Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he couldn&#39;t have asked for a worse start to his NFL career,
&quot;It was a thing that happens, you just worry about the next game and that&#39;s it,&quot; Hayne said.
Hayne likened the blunder to his Origin debut back in 2007, when a pass at in his own in-goal area resulted in a try for Queensland.
All in all, it was still a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia&#39;s richest man, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airfield.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized, and his democratic efforts were stymied.
Because of the high number of refugees, the Free Voters are demanding the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria.
At the beginning of the FW autumn retreat in Großwallstadt, party and faction leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a severe crisis in Bavaria&#39;s schools if there weren&#39;t new teachers for the many new students: &quot;We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapsing to preserve,&quot; said Aiwanger.
&quot;Otherwise we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system.&quot;
The parliamentary group of free voters meets in the Lower Franconian municipality until Friday.
Actually, completely different main topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now also dominates the free voters&#39; meeting.
&quot;Of course, the topic of asylum will supersede the exam,&quot; said Aiwanger.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria, like those that existed during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
&quot;It can&#39;t go on like this, we have to look at the causes,&quot; said the Free Voters boss.
The Free Voters want to deport rejected asylum seekers as quickly as possible.
That&#39;s why Aiwanger called for more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims: &quot;We also need at least 50 new asylum judges,&quot; said Aiwanger.
The FW boss criticized the fact that several federal states were not consistent: &quot;We need nationwide uniform standards of the federal states.&quot;
&quot;Bayern deports, others don&#39;t.&quot;
&quot;We have to become more capable of acting.&quot;
But state politics in Großwallstadt should not be neglected.
A long-running issue remains on the agenda: education policy.
At the start of the new school year, Minister of Education Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) started the pilot project &quot;Mittelstufe plus&quot; at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the middle school level from three to four years is being tested - as a result it then takes nine years again to graduate from high school.
But that doesn&#39;t go far enough for Aiwanger.
&quot;The G9 issue must be accelerated,&quot; said the FW boss.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools that want it.
Free travel with the G9 wherever you want it.
Firmer Wall Street helps Dax along
After largely directionless and nervous trading, the German stock market closed with profits.
Only in the afternoon did a firmer start on the US stock exchanges ensure a clear direction, which ultimately pushed the Dax up by 0.56 percent to 10,188.13 points.
The MDax for medium-sized stocks gained 0.54 percent to 19,552.88 points.
The technology-heavy TecDax rose by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.
The EuroStoxx 50, the leading index in the euro zone, advanced by 1.01 percent to 3207.60 points.
The trading centers in London and Paris also posted solid gains.
In the US, the Dow Jones index was recently up around 1 percent.
Many stockbrokers expect that the markets will remain stationary until after the interest rate decision in the USA and also until the great fall on the futures exchanges this Friday.
The discussion about the burden of the nuclear phase-out has meanwhile pushed RWE shares to a record low and also left deep marks on Eon.
According to &quot;Spiegel&quot;, the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions.
The federal government denied the figures given in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by a further 3.22 percent at the top of the Dax.
According to a trader, a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot;Barron&#39;s&quot; over the weekend had an impact.
Accordingly, investors are currently paying too little attention to the German chipmaker.
The investments in promising wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should pay off.
Car stocks were in demand: Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were sold than in the same period last year, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt.
The papers of the car manufacturers Daimler and BMW increased by 1.34 percent and 2.21 percent respectively.
Volkswagen preferences increased in price by 1.26 percent.
On the German bond market, the current yield of listed federal securities fell to 0.48 (Friday: 0.50) percent.
The Rex pension index rose by 0.12 percent to 139.55 points.
The Bund future lost 0.71 percent to 154.11 points.
The euro fell in the afternoon to 1.1262 dollars.
Around noon, the European Central Bank had set the reference rate at 1.1305 (1.1268) US dollars.
The dollar thus cost 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
4 people killed after police officers fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
Violence erupted in Rupandehi district, some 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu, on Tuesday night.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, with some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then shot it in the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the rubber bullets used, which are known to kill but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, appeared to produce such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal&#39;s southern plains, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political clout.
There have also been protests in western Nepal by the Tharus ethnic group who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since March 10.
He was killed on August 1 when the four major political parties signed an agreement to carve up the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally governed for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers sped up the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on certain clauses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials have said the new constitution could go into effect on Sunday.
Building area planned in the city
The site at the Emden youth center Alte Post is to be built on again.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mix of retail, commercial and residential is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden wants to market a 4,000 square meter property in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post youth center.
The preparations for this are currently underway.
The plan is to use the site for a mix of retail, commercial and residential use.
According to the city, the company is waiting for corresponding offers.
Which investors come into question is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
A few months ago, the city of Emden bought part of the property on the corner of Ringstraße and Große Straße and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for the holiday home settlement on the Kleinen Meer near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
A number of residents are still concerned - they fear that their leisure retreat will be sold out
For months, negotiations, brooding, debates and drawings had taken place behind closed doors.
Now the plans for a new holiday home complex on the Kleinen Meer near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emden company &quot;System-Bau&quot;, presented its plans to the city development committee of the Emden Council for the first time on Monday evening.
Originally, this item was on the non-public part of the agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP parliamentary group, who accused the investors and the administration of keeping secrets, Ralf Behrends from the System-Bau management went on the offensive: &quot;We still don&#39;t have an answer to all the questions,&quot; he told the audience Council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to counter all rumors now.
The project, which costs around ten to twelve million euros, has been under discussion for months.
The pictures and new details about the desired hotel construction provoked violent reactions among sea shack owners who had come to the meeting.
Roberto Schulz, sea shack owner and board member of the residents&#39; interest group, Pro Hieve, complains: &quot;It&#39;s going to be a giant block that towers over all the other buildings.&quot;
In addition, like many other project critics, he fears that traffic will increase significantly due to the planned size of the facility: &quot;Whole busloads have to come for it to pay off,&quot; says Schulz
What exactly will happen on the one-hectare site of the former restaurant is still unclear.
There is no operator yet.
&quot;First we have to have a coherent concept,&quot; said Ralf Behrends.
Because this was still missing, the development plans are still variable.
Twin offspring in gorillas in the Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy about the offspring of its gorillas.
26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins yesterday.
Twin births are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo was almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins has not yet been determined as their mother Dian has been holding them close to their bodies.
First the &quot;image&quot; had reported.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The US National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad low-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands that has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system roughly midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical cyclone in the next two days, the Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches match-giving campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a match-funding campaign set to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations aimed at helping thousands of refugees who have swept across European nations as they flee war-torn and impoverished countries .
Google took an unusually personal approach to announcing the call for donations on its blog.
Rather than let a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experience.
&quot;Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear,&quot; she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown, many people like my family are desperate for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first donations raised globally will be doubled to $11 million up to a value of $5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by Syria&#39;s four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight-loss surgery for slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years, according to a new study.
It&#39;s too early to tell if slightly obese people with diabetes live longer after weight loss surgery than those who receive nonsurgical treatments.
&quot;The mortality data takes a long time to show anything,&quot; said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in weight loss surgery, who wrote an editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries, or bariatric surgery, use different methods to decrease the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body&#39;s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgery has proven effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted in people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or greater.
BMI, a measure of weight-to-height, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates someone is overweight, and people with a BMI over 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, the researchers from Taiwan&#39;s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and gastric tube construction -- to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in humans who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those who underwent the surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, among those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments, BMI remained about the same at 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% had complete diabetes resolution and 28% had partial resolution.
In comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes completely resolved in only 1 percent and partially in only about 2 percent.
In addition, outcomes in controls for blood pressure, triglycerides, and &quot;bad&quot; LDL cholesterol &quot;were generally better in the &#39;surgical&#39; group,&quot; the authors found.
The researchers also monitored the patient&#39;s blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflect blood glucose levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After the operation, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better &quot;glycemic control&quot; -- as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels -- did not reduce mortality at five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his colleagues.
The research team also compared average results from the two types of surgery.
By year five, the bypass surgery group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3, 1% vs. 2.1%) and were more likely to achieve complete resolution of diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study doesn&#39;t show a five-year survival benefit from surgery, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years compared to a group who tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study didn&#39;t show a survival benefit for the surgery patients, Blackstone said it&#39;s reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
&quot;That&#39;s the critical point of this study because it says this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group&quot; with no increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that once the patient&#39;s BMI is between 27 and 30, people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously.
&quot;I think we&#39;re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,&quot; she said.
I think once they&#39;ve accumulated these genetic changes that have hardwired their bodies to obesity and diabetes, it&#39;s really hard to reverse.&quot;
Love story takes place in the Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently receiving more and more attention in fiction: A young woman, unpopular and unsightly when she was at school, meets the crush of her youth years later, and he falls in love with her.
This is also the case in the recently published novel &quot;Actually we are not like that&quot; by Luisa Binder.
In addition to the love story, the novel should be of particular interest to readers from the Hunsrück region, as it takes place in Langweiler and the surrounding towns.
The full-time author grew up in Langweiler and is happy that she was able to erect a literary monument to her hometown.
&#39;It&#39;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe&#39; - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, said the Dalai Lama, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the refugees&#39; homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis early in his ten-day visit to the UK in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, which is dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that, under the circumstances, the interests of humanity should come before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis, while admirable, was not proportionate to the situation.
&quot;It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,&quot; he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria&#39;s efforts in dealing with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
&quot;Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you need to think about long-term solutions on how to create real peace and development, mainly through education, for these Muslim countries,&quot; he stressed.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We must reduce the use of force.
&quot;The use of force has never solved these problems,&quot; he added.
Addressing the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush&#39;s actions after the 9/11 terrorist attack, pointing out that the violent US response triggered a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush, telling him that nonviolence is the way to solve this problem.
&quot;I know his motives were good, but he used violence and it has had unexpected consequences,&quot; the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children&#39;s use of hand sanitizer in past 4 years
Poison control centers in the US are reporting a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of 12 swallowing alcohol-based hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
according to dr Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand sanitizer use among children under 12 years old, poison control centers report, increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
&quot;Kids are getting more and more access to these products, and unfortunately, a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room,&quot; Lopez told CNN.
He said some kids drink sanitizer on purpose, while some do it to impress their friends or for a dare on social media.
Videos on YouTube show youngsters drinking sanitizer just for a cheap experience.
Teens have reportedly mixed sanitizer with alcohol-based mouthwash to make a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted by the attractive scents of the disinfectants.
&quot;A kid doesn&#39;t think this is bad for them,&quot; Lopez said.
Many of the more appealing (hand sanitizers) are the ones that are scented.
There are strawberry, grape and orange scented disinfectants that are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizers contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Even a few splashes can lead to alcohol poisoning, especially in small children.
&quot;It&#39;s highly concentrated alcohol,&quot; said Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the poison control center at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansa City.
Now, you wouldn&#39;t leave a sip of whiskey lying around, but people keep these hand sanitizers within reach of children, and when children get at it, it&#39;s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested four squirts of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold for an adult to be legally intoxicated, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside of Atlanta.
Nhaijah slurred her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight at a separate children&#39;s hospital for signs of brain trauma because the girl had fallen from drinking and hit her head, Ritchey said.
&quot;That was very scary,&quot; Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah&#39;s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free products or disinfectant wipes, and to store hand sanitizer out of child&#39;s reach.
Beyond alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been associated with fatalities.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing hand sanitizer that contained a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, rather than ethyl alcohol, which has been listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in New York state plotted to poison their &quot;mean&quot; teacher by placing antibacterial products around the classroom,&quot; according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her room.
The police regarded the foiled plan as &quot;chatter&quot; and referred disciplinary action to the school board.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a rear-end collision on the Querspange between Nordring and Auf Herdenen, a 33-year-old driver was slightly injured in a rear-end collision.
A 60-year-old truck driver drove on the Querspange in the direction of the industrial area roundabout and noticed too late that two vehicles in front had stopped at the roundabout.
As a result, he crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed this vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta in front of it.
The police said the vehicles involved in the accident suffered property damage of around 10,000 euros.
The 33-year-old&#39;s Audi was no longer drivable and had to be towed away.

Griffiths downplays talk of disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic which were dismissed out of hand by Griffiths. The latter insisted he and his team-mates are not under heightened scrutiny as they prepare to face the Dutch leaders.
I don&#39;t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are looking forward to it.
Lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutchman - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Boer has said Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: &quot;In Holland they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?&quot;
It&#39;s because the Rangers aren&#39;t there.
People here aren&#39;t just talking about the return of Rangers.
You&#39;re talking about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that&#39;s what interests them.
There&#39;s a lot of excitement in the old firm games and it&#39;s not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games.
I&#39;ll turn things around, Deila swears.
RONNY Deila has accepted Celtic have to fight but the Norwegian boss vowed to turn things around.
After losing to Malmö and being knocked out of the Champions League, they lost to 10-man Aberdeen, who are now clear at the top of the table by five points.
But Deila said: &quot;Celtic have had bad times before and we&#39;ll be back.&quot;
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it&#39;s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what&#39;s happening.
We feel the same way - but we have to go further.
We really, really need Celtic&#39;s support because it makes the players better.
Standing together now is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago suggesting he was eyeing some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is wary of signing newcomers and insists he doesn&#39;t want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox squad.
The ex-Brentford boss said: &quot;The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.&quot;
The players coming in the summer have that pre-season time to integrate what you&#39;ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with retreat notice
Swansea striker Michu, who has been in talks with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted he may withdraw when his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has struggled with an annoying ankle for two years and failed to make the exit from Wales this summer.
Hearts suspended for SFA battle over Neilson&#39;s comments
The Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and then lost 3-2, but the defender&#39;s red card was later overturned - Collum&#39;s third red card to be revoked in eight months.
Neilson stands by what he said, insisting &quot;I didn&#39;t question integrity, I didn&#39;t comment on performance.&quot;
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The incorrigible Hibee was rebuked after he admitted singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of an Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
&quot;It was a derby and it was the heat of the moment,&quot; said the striker, adding: &quot;It&#39;s safe to say I won&#39;t be returning to Tynecastle unless it&#39;s for Celtic Glasgow.&quot;
Tannadice board has confidence in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists Dundee United board still have faith in the management team to turn things around - but admits the decline must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We&#39;re going to get the boys back on their feet,&quot; Donnelly said.
McInnes happy to &quot;win ugly&quot; against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes concedes his Aberdeen side have had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league win which gave them a five-point lead over Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney&#39;s first-half penalty .
McInnes said: &quot;There isn&#39;t a team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that hasn&#39;t won games of that kind.&quot;
Unemployment in Scotland is flat, while in the UK as a whole it is rising.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 in May-July, while for the UK as a whole the number of people out of work rose by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland&#39;s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than the UK&#39;s 5.5 percent, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number employed now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 per cent over the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 73.5 per cent.
Commenting on the latest figures, Secretary of State for Scotland David Mundell said: &quot;The Government&#39;s long-term plan has laid the groundwork for a stronger economy.&quot;
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a fall in unemployment.
Drunks disrupted the process
Since the security personnel could not pacify the situation, the employees called the police.
The officers were only able to take the troublemakers into custody with the use of pepper spray.
A breath alcohol test showed a 16-year-old to be 0.89 per mille.
The adolescent was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had a blood alcohol level of 2.15 and initially remained in custody.
Why I&#39;ll Witness an Execution in Oklahoma
Later today, barring a late legal intervention, I will watch a man put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn&#39;t, I will be sitting in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation first came through his best friend in January, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day drew near, I began to fear.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It&#39;s true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the US, and since there are often more applications than places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who gets elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media seats from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will observe it without emotion.
I can not do this.
I will be seated next to Richard Glossip&#39;s closest friend, with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months of phone calls and a two and a half hour visit.
i like the guy
We often laugh a lot when we speak.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist took to Twitter to accuse me of sacrificing my impartiality.
Here&#39;s the lesson.
Tell the inmate&#39;s story any way they want and you&#39;ll gain access.
I complained to her.
She conceded that she &quot;could have worded it better,&quot; but she still thinks what I&#39;m doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip took issue with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn&#39;t tell me what to write, and I wouldn&#39;t do it even if he did.
I told him he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write.
If he dies, he thinks public relations will help the anti-death penalty movement.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I&#39;ve been doing.
I don&#39;t want to go into all the details again here.
I can&#39;t say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions following the assassination of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a perpetrator of the act.
But I think there&#39;s a strong possibility that he&#39;s not guilty of murder.
I am sure that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And from this perspective I will see him die.
I can&#39;t claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can contact for this.
What you&#39;ll get from me is what it&#39;s like to see a man die a needless death.
Man talked into coming out of Canning River after wet police chase
The Canning Vale policeman stayed dry as he persuaded the Canning River man.
An attempt by a Perth man to get rid of the police was unsuccessful when he found himself in shallow and swampy water, just yards from a police officer who was trying to &quot;gently coax him to return to shore.&quot;
Canning Vale Police were called to a trespassing incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to escape towards the Canning River.
But he didn&#39;t get very far.
&quot;He was standing in the water - and he said, &#39;I&#39;m not coming out, come and get me,&#39;&quot; Senior Sergeant Sandel Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec wasn&#39;t too keen on getting his uniform wet, so he employed a more reliable tactic - &quot;A good cop negotiates&quot;.
&quot;Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,&quot; Senior Sergeant Castledine said.
Championship soccer player Ben Cousins provides a memorable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into a ditch to avoid a breathalyzer and then attempted to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to humorously plan a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards were trying to spy on him and is threatening to pull out of racing
Peter Moody claims that Racing Victoria stewards tried to install a spy in his stables last year and threatened to pull out of the race immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria&#39;s stewards and integrity department, claiming they were conducting a personal campaign against him with the late scratching of Lady Tatai over a race day treatment, the last straw on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and found himself in difficult conditions when it came to the positive cobalt swab at Lidaris, which he cannot explain.
He had held back for 18 months over the spying allegations and didn&#39;t want it to &quot;look like grapes hanging too high.&quot;
&quot;I intended not to say anything about it and I&#39;ve sat on it for a long time, but sometimes you get so frustrated that it&#39;s all coming out at once,&quot; Moody said.
You know it went on.
Sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said.
I&#39;ll go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around with my head held high and I want my owners to think I&#39;m trying my best for them.
If they start thinking I&#39;m not doing that, then I shouldn&#39;t be a coach anymore.
I then have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody blasted the bombshell in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable.
&quot;Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name if asked - and offered him employment in my stables to gather information about what I have within of my stables,&quot; Moody said on Racing.com.
You obviously think I&#39;m a scammer.
If that&#39;s the case, surely they should be touching their noses because they failed in trying to touch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, Acting President of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and still are today.
Should that make me think it&#39;s getting personal?
Has the RVL acted cowardly and perhaps blame people outside of coaches for what&#39;s going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think it&#39;s me.
Maybe they need to take my license away and cast me out, and I have no doubt what I&#39;m saying will make them think about it now.
But I&#39;ve gotten to the point now where I don&#39;t care, and that makes me sad.
It makes me really sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can walk.
The coach&#39;s levels of frustration have built with Lidari&#39;s long-running cobalt probe, and the late scratching led him to say he &quot;could throw his license over the table.&quot;
Moody, best known for his coaching of undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule &quot;ridiculous&quot; after applying a pack of mud or clay to the horse&#39;s legs, which was against the rules.
&quot;It&#39;s against the rules of racing.
I have to take full responsibility for that,&quot; he said.
&quot;One of my employees mistakenly put mud on the leg.
It could have been like this last night.
It could have been like this all day yesterday, which it was.
But it was the same on race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the race-day pack. An investigation into this matter has been opened.
It&#39;s a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about the horse.
&quot;We all agree that we need rules, but this has gone too far,&quot; Moody said.
Man arrested after hit-and-run
Police arrested a man over the weekend after a hit and run collision with a cyclist in Cobram.
The cyclist was helicoptered to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley motorway on Saturday morning.
Police said the motorist continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
A 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton on Monday.
He is expected to be charged with hit-and-run and failure to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains hospitalized. He is in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy hits back at rivals over wrestling claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described criticism of his players&#39; tackling as &quot;agenda setting&quot; by two Premier League favorites in the NRL.
Sydney Rooster&#39;s coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed Storm&#39;s players to &quot;wrestle&quot; with his team during Storm&#39;s epic win in Friday night&#39;s qualifying finals in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a thinly veiled comment on the Storm team after his side achieved Saturday night&#39;s Finals win over North Queensland Cowboys. He called the match a &quot;prime example&quot; of rugby league and said the Queensland duo weren&#39;t &quot;too good&quot; at wrestling.
Bellamy defended his team&#39;s tackle, saying that when it comes to tackling, they only focus on their &quot;contact.&quot;
Bellamy added that criticism of his team from two top coaches gave him confidence as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
&quot;It keeps coming up - I didn&#39;t hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,&quot; Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven&#39;t changed anything in our defensive system or techniques in the whole year. But in the last six weeks we&#39;ve made our contact on tackles a real focus and that&#39;s turned the tide for us.
Trent has been there for three years now and he obviously has a great team to coach. So he&#39;s probably not used to losing, so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It&#39;s funny how this keeps popping up this time of year.
Bellamy has attacked Bennett&#39;s idea of &quot;exciting football&quot;, reminding his mentor that Bennett&#39;s St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot;boring&quot; football.
Wayne speaks of exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to ours on Friday night and how exciting their game was,&quot; Bellamy said.
I remember back in 2010 St George was criticized for being a boring team and Wayne said he wouldn&#39;t give a shit.
But now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play when you have these types of players.
He made that statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like them.
I build more confidence because they say those things because they&#39;re a little worried about having to play us.
They probably didn&#39;t think of us six weeks ago when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm vs. Roosters game produced a higher score than the Broncos vs. Cowboys game.
The Broncos game must have been a good game, I haven&#39;t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16:12?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more tries in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or is taking breaks and not scoring something exciting?
For me, it&#39;s the schedules.
If they mention us, it means we&#39;re going to run into them at some stage.
The Storm team is off this weekend as they won the right to host either North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the Prefinals at AAMI Park next Saturday night. Ticket sales will start next Tuesday morning.
Serbians on $200,000 bail after drug charges
A man who could face a life sentence for attempting to obtain 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after federal police found 100kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his co-defendants at the marina later that morning and later at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic&#39;s attorney argued that there was no evidence he attempted to possess the entire quantity and that the café could have been for an innocuous reason.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned about Maksimovic&#39;s risk of absconding.
He has clear ties with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia,&quot; he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovic&#39;s mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 bail as security to secure his release.
&quot;After reading the affidavits of the two individuals, it is clear that the requirement of $200,000 in security is a real financial burden,&quot; Judge Flanagan said.
But that alone won&#39;t be enough to stop him from not showing up, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail on conditions that he surrender his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily and observe a 6pm-6am curfew.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: the driver&#39;s cab tears apart
A truck driver was seriously injured in a rear-end collision involving three trucks on Autobahn 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening.
Two of the three trucks involved had braked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to swerve to the left at the last moment, the police said.
The cab of the driver who caused the accident was completely torn apart.
The driver was taken to hospital with serious injuries.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely blocked for over six hours until 2 a.m.
There was damage of 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girls&#39; phones to lure pedophiles into sending pictures
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl&#39;s phone to request images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl&#39;s phone while she was sleeping, logged into an online messaging service from which he received a series of indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl later woke up to discover the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg&#39;s hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
Police took action and saw the five images, then analyzed computers found at the address and discovered &quot;concerning&quot; web searches that used terms to look for indecent images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officers that he did it as it would lead to &quot;pedophiles on the internet&quot; and he then &quot;pretended to be a cop to scare them&quot;.
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: &quot;He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted the searches on the computer were done by him but said it was because he wanted to claim to be a police officer to scare paedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he gets sick in the head when he drinks and said he then wants to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: &quot;When the girl found the messages on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the indecent pictures on the phone and confronted the accused about it.
The girl was interviewed and said that the defendant used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to the indictment of taking indecent pictures of children on June 14 last year, breaching conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing to have been released on March 24 of this year.
Defense attorney Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not appear on the sex offenders&#39; register because it could be argued that &quot;no significant sexual element&quot; was found in his offense.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael delayed sentencing until October for background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in the case but was remanded in custody pending hearings on other pending cases.
He was placed on the sex offenders&#39; register before the date of the sentence.
Smugglers use small border crossings to Germany
More and more refugees are being picked up away from the major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left people at smaller border crossings for fear of discovery and arrest
out on the Austrian side, said a spokesman for the federal police.
Since Tuesday, more than 1,000 refugees have been apprehended along the border river Inn in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn.
They had reached the German side on foot over bridges and weirs.
There they are received by federal police officers and forwarded to registration.
According to the Federal Police, significantly more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station on Wednesday compared to the beginning of the week.
A spokesman said in the morning that around 700 people had arrived in the state capital by 8 a.m. alone.
After the reintroduction of controls at the German-Austrian border, 1,759 refugees reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: Foothills of tropical storm &quot;Henry&quot; expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of gusts of wind in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
The German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart announced that warm sea air is currently flowing into the country due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe.
The strong low is the foothills of tropical storm Henry, which has moved across the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands in the past few days.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected, especially in Baden.
According to the DWD, gusts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour can also be expected in the Black Forest, on the Swabian Alb and in the Lake Constance district until Thursday morning.
On Friday, the sun will be longer again.
It&#39;s the crowd that counts: Every two years, the car manufacturers show their innovations at the IAA.
In 2015, there was a lot of movement in compact cars, which are currently selling particularly well.
Cars from the compact class are currently in particularly high demand: According to the Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA), around 28.1 percent of new registrations were in this segment in August alone.
This is also reflected at the IAA (public days September 17th to 27th).
Between all the futuristic concept vehicles and new full-size and luxury cars, many new compact models will be presented this year.
One of the biggest premieres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra, which will be in dealerships in the fall.
&quot;The Astra is an extremely important model for us,&quot; said Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann at the show.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
So that the volume model also sells well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf in prospect, which starts at 17,650 euros.
The current Astra costs from 16,990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
The Hessians also offer other diesel and petrol engines from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, which for the first time also include three-cylinder petrol engines.
Unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five-door model.
The station wagon, which can already be seen at the IAA, will follow in the spring as the second variant.
And what other new compact cars will be on display alongside the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the fair, the Mégane can only be seen as a five-door in a conventional and a decidedly sporty GT version.
It will go on sale early next year, then also as a station wagon.
Infiniti: The Infiniti Q30 is brand new in the segment.
The Nissan offshoot wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment with the new model.
The compact Infiniti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand&#39;s design line.
The base model will have a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
A diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp is also available.
Suzuki Baleno: The Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt, is also new in the segment.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW/111 hp.
According to the manufacturer, the maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm).
Sales of the Baleno will start in Europe in spring 2016.
DS 4: The compact class model DS 4, which can be seen at the IAA, is not entirely new, but completely renewed.
On the outside, the designers of the classy Citroën offshoot mainly worked on the front end: Here the radiator grille was redesigned and the modified headlights were equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system in particular has been modernized, the number of buttons reduced by a touchscreen and Apple&#39;s CarPlay integrated for the first time.
In addition, there will be a number of revisions and new variants in the compact class at the IAA, such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters cell is inhumane
The Federal Constitutional Court has ruled in favor of an ex-prisoner at Tegel Prison who was housed in a cell that was too small for months.
Because of the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in cells that are too small.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, those affected can even hope for money if they have only been locked in the cramped rooms for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, an ex-prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: Between June and November 2009 he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel prison in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space; the toilet was not spatially separated.
The man, who according to his lawyer is now free again, was then transferred to a larger cell.
His official liability lawsuit against the state of Berlin because of the unworthy prison conditions failed.
But the constitutional judges overturned the judgment of the Berlin Court of Appeal and sent the case back there for re-examination.
They see the human dignity of men violated.
The Court of Appeal will now decide on the amount of compensation
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment from the period in question are relevant for compensation, there is a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, &quot;an atrophy of the legal protection of the personality would have to be feared&quot;.
The Court of Appeal must now clarify the amount of the monetary compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of convicts.
It was only in April that they awarded a prisoner damages because he was locked in a cell naked.
According to a 2011 decision, the multiple occupancy of a cell without a separate toilet is also inhumane.
On Wednesday, Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court, which had certified a prisoner in a parallel case in November 2009 as inhumane accommodation.
The plaintiff at the time was held in a cell similar to the one in the Karlsruhe case for between 15 and 21 hours a day for three months.
The Berlin prisons have also made the headlines in recent weeks because of a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore locked up again and again for 23 hours, aggressiveness increases, even fights are said to have broken out because of the tense situation.
According to information from the judicial press office, 21 positions in Tegel are vacant due to a lack of young people, and 19 are to be eliminated in 2016.
Angela Merkel and refugee policy: &quot;We can do it&quot;
The immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it.
What&#39;s in store for Germany?
According to forecasts by the Federal Ministry of the Interior, around 800,000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year. According to Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to take in a million refugees.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: &quot;I say again and again: We can do it, and we can do it&quot;.
The following overview gives an overview of what is to come in Germany.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimate by the Federal Building Ministry) and 400,000 (estimate by the Pestel Institute) apartments will be needed every year - for the next five years.
That is almost twice as much as is currently being built (250,000 apartments).
The lack of living space is particularly dramatic when it comes to affordable rental properties: every year, 60,000 to 80,000 social housing units are no longer subject to rent control, and refugees will also apply for these particularly cheap apartments.
Federal Building Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) therefore wants to double the funding from the current 518 million to one billion euros.
From the point of view of the Pestel Institute, this is far too little: 80,000 social housing units would have to be built every year and the federal government would have to invest a subsidy of 6.4 billion per year.
Scientists and the Federal Building Minister agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in residential construction.
According to estimates by the Institute for Labor Market and Vocational Research, it can be assumed that 55 percent of refugees in Germany will be able to work in the long term.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
However, the decisive factor for the integration of refugees is whether they can find work in Germany.
According to migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt, work is the key to social contacts, to being valued in the receiving society, but also to the self-esteem of immigrants.
According to Thränhardt, there has been a political change in Germany: from a ban on refugees working to recognition of work.
While there used to be a ban on work for asylum seekers of up to five years, this was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence requirement, which limits asylum seekers to one place of residence.
In society - also because of the shortage of skilled workers - the majority view has prevailed that refugees should be given faster access to the labor market.
A major hurdle for access to the job market is a lack of German language skills.
So far there has not been a sufficient range of general and job-related language courses.
Studies also show that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
In Thränhardt&#39;s view, the development of networks is therefore the silver bullet for work integration.
The Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugee parents send their children to day care centers, an estimated ten to 15 percent: &quot;For the uprooted parents, it is first of all very important to keep the family together,&quot; says Ilja Koschembar, spokesman for young people and families in the Berlin Senate Administration.
In order to convince the family of the advantages of the day care center, the administration distributes flyers in different languages.
If the need for educators increases sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacities - for example by allowing more technical schools.
In the federal states, pupils without knowledge of German are prepared for the lessons in welcome classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, as in Berlin, by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers from the Berlin school administration.
The German Student Union estimates that around 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or tolerated persons from studying - the only exception so far has been Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his position.
Access to university could be made easier for refugees who are willing to study.
Refugees with a residence permit or toleration no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act when they start studying.
The latter generally do not receive Bafög, since they do not fall under the group of people entitled to Bafög.
Until now, tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years in order to be eligible for student loans. From January 1, 2016, this period will be reduced to 15 months.
However, this funding gap must also be closed, according to Steffen Krach, Berlin&#39;s State Secretary for Science, and the German Student Union.
The students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future because many refugees are Muslims and for many religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches have, and further develop the existing state-church law into a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to set up an Islamic welfare association that would take care of the newcomers in a professional manner.
Rights also include duties.
The representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant it certain control options.
This also includes the willingness to take courageous action against religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany.
Those who wanted to settle such conflicts in Germany &quot;immediately forfeited their right to stay here in Germany,&quot; he said on Bayrischer Rundfunk.
He suggested translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be much more of an issue for society as a whole than it is today.
This means that the majority of society will also have to change, and the reduction of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
As a result of European decisions, Germany has had an anti-discrimination agency and a general equality law for almost a decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU series of murders showed, in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for everyone: What migrant organizations and the interest groups of non-white Germans have been demanding for a long time and what international agreements such as the Anti-Racism Convention oblige Germany to do must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens are to make use of their opportunities - for example good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care for the refugees expected so far, says Medical President Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
&quot;In terms of manpower and capacities, we can do it,&quot; he told the Tagesspiegel.
However, additional money would have to flow into the system for this.
To avoid bottlenecks, Montgomery demands that all arrivals be given health cards as soon as they register.
Services rendered could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long term it is highly questionable to fobbe off so many people with the limited catalog of benefits provided for by the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act.
Otherwise, the language barriers are the main problem for the doctors.
The Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has already proven that migrants are less well informed about their illnesses than other patients.
She demands that interpreter costs not only have to be covered in clinics, but also in medical practices.
Many refugees would have been helped with more general medical contact points in the emergency departments.
And with a different diagnostic view.
Among refugee children, for example, there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is about HIV education.
According to Montgomery, German doctors can handle the sometimes different clinical pictures because of their training.
&quot;Parasitic infestations or tuberculosis are not so difficult to detect&quot;. And as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned, the refugees may even provide relief.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, and some refugees are even doctors.
In order to be allowed to practice, however, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take another examination.
According to estimates by the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK), at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill: Most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are particularly vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, President of the BPtK.
A recently published study by the Technical University of Munich shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives in Germany traumatized.
Anyone suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder suffers, among other things, from so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, tachycardia and fear of death.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disorders, severe jumpiness and emotional numbness.
Early treatment is necessary to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees have received psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social welfare offices, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social welfare offices, clerks or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses usually decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to misjudgments, says Munz.
Manege invites you to dream
With the new &quot;Passion&quot; production, Circus Probst draws on the traditions of circus art.
The aim is to captivate every age group with fascinating acrobatics, animal training and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the arena on the Ziegelwasen.
&quot;Our passion is the circus.&quot;
&quot;I can&#39;t imagine living without my circus family,&quot; says Stephanie Probst, animal trainer and junior boss.
&quot;Passion&quot; - this is the motto of the current arena production.
The circus has been in the hands of the Probst family for more than 33 years.
So the gift of enthusiasm runs in the blood of the family.
&quot;It&#39;s important to us to get people away from their everyday routine and take them with us into a completely different world for two hours,&quot; emphasizes the 27-year-old junior manager.
Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept &quot;ring cocktail with cosmopolitan flair&quot;.
50 cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The circus program convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family captivates the audience with wit and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also know their craft.
The Cuban duo wants to easily take on the heroes of silent films.
Lightness and flexibility - they identify with these words.
Her humorous art on the mast should take women&#39;s hearts by storm.
Apart from numerous laughter salvos, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinate with sensitivity and agility.
Balancing on a sphere with a unicycle?
No problem for He Yuan.
Contortionists fascinate and frighten at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and fascinates with her mobility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect.
&quot;The animals are part of our family,&quot; emphasizes Stephanie&#39;s mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the keeping of circus animals are all too often a topic for various animal protection organizations.
Stephanie Probst also comments: &quot;If our animals are not doing well, we are not doing well either&quot;.
Around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every stroke.
The &quot;four-legged artists&quot;, as they are affectionately called, anticipate every wish as far as possible.
We want to work with the animals and have fun with them.
If the animal doesn&#39;t feel well, it doesn&#39;t want to go into the ring.
So the top priority is to take good care of the animals.
The Probst family is particularly proud of their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a Shetland pony stallion and a zebra mare.
The two animals lived together in an enclosure for eight years and nothing happened.
&quot;But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there,&quot; says Brigitte Probst.
The Zebroid may not be ready for the ring yet, but it is the unique mascot of Circus Probst.
So there should be something for every visitor.
&quot;One thing is for sure,&quot; says Stephanie Probst: &quot;It doesn&#39;t matter whether there are five or 1,200 spectators, we always give our best and are wholeheartedly involved.&quot;
The Circus Probst invites you to its performances from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 p.m. and 8 p.m.
On Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m.
Thursday is family day, the prices for the performance at 5 p.m. are reduced.
The animal show is also open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Zimbabwe&#39;s Robert Mugabe makes false speech in Parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa&#39;s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He was unharmed, but video of the fall quickly went viral on social media.
The opening of Parliament was also marred by claims by opposition MPs that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to boo at Mr Mugabe&#39;s speech.
For the past month they had booed him and interrupted him during his State of the Union address in Parliament - the speech he was repeating on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) spokesman Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their cellphones warning them not to disrupt Mr Mugabe&#39;s speech.
&quot;The message comes from a number that is not displayed but it is titled &#39;Death&#39;,&quot; he told reporters after Mugabe&#39;s speech.
She warns the MPs concerned that immunity ends in Parliament and once they leave Parliament their parliamentary immunity is no longer in effect.
The chief spokesman said the Morgan Tsvangirai-led party was &quot;concerned&quot; about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of the restructuring and cost-cutting efforts at the company&#39;s services.
Later this year, HP will split into two public companies and separate its computer and printer business from its faster-growing enterprise hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will result in a charge of over $2.7 billion beginning in the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
&quot;These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise,&quot; said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive, who will lead the unit after the separation.
&quot;Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and deep portfolio of businesses to help companies transition to a new style of doing business,&quot; said Whitman.
As a standalone company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and &quot;will be focused on providing unprecedented, integrated technology solutions for businesses,&quot; according to a company statement.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to make electrical equipment, and whose Palo Alto Garage has been called &quot;the birthplace of Silicon Valley.&quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to manage the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
The move from HP, the world&#39;s second largest PC maker and one of the largest US tech companies, is the latest in the space, based on the belief that narrowly focused companies perform better.
Arsenal FC captain Mikel Arteta says team-mates need to be behind injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dynamo Zagreb game
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it&#39;s only September and assuming his rehabilitation goes according to plan there&#39;s no reason why he can&#39;t be back playing before Christmas.
That optimistic scenario already means Wilshere is certain to miss at least four games for England and given his history, his involvement in next summer&#39;s European Championships is certainly still in doubt.
The big shame with this current issue is that Wilshere ended last season strong after suffering a separate ankle injury and then got back to his old swing during preseason.
&quot;This kind of injury doesn&#39;t threaten your career,&quot; said Wenger.
It&#39;s a bone that didn&#39;t heal well.
It&#39;s no big deal.
This was just an accident.
It wasn&#39;t related to his ankles or any injuries he had previously.
That may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is an inherent risk of further injury whenever a player attempts to return mid-season.
An uncomfortable pattern also develops.
Premier Injuries Ltd&#39;s investigation records 23 different illnesses for Wilshere since his debut six years ago.
He also played in just 65 of Arsenal&#39;s 157 league games over the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs to record the most injury days in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08.
Wenger accepts the potential for a vicious circle but Arsenal believe an improvement in injury rates over the last season will continue.
&quot;Sometimes when you come back from an injury you have a vulnerable period, a time where you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,&quot; Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get over this.
I hope his body stabilizes, I am confident that he will and that he will have a career of the kind that he deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League season against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night ahead of games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is set to rotate within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, meaning Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
&quot;I&#39;m trying to keep my balance and give the players who need it a little breather,&quot; said Wenger.
Although Arsenal are clear favorites to progress through Group F, Zagreb&#39;s Maksimir Stadium is one of the most intimidating venues in Europe.
Dynamo are also unbeaten after 41 games after launching the &quot;invincible&quot; campaign last season.
The stadium was hit by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal learned the lesson of last season&#39;s Champions League surrender to Monaco and remains driven by distant hopes of his management guiding the club to their first European triumph.
&quot;This drive is immense,&quot; said Wenger.
It has never worked at Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006 but on the other hand I&#39;ve been in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that teaches us serious lessons about male friendships
The lack of similar portrayal on shows is evident, especially given how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever, as evidenced by suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013 it was the leading cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common in men than women.
In an effort to address the issue, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of the Man, aiming to challenge the culture that prevents men from seeking help, if you need them.
Friendship is at the heart of the fight to complete this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a high enough percentage of &quot;healthy mood&quot; friends, their chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of sane friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But of course you have to have friends first for a friendship to work.
In the age of social media communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, immediacy of response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even when in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; Money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which affects our mental health much more profoundly.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money really can&#39;t buy happiness.
The beauty of Friends was that this focus was turned on its head.
Each character was defined not by their work but by their personality, which shone through interacting as a friend.
The humor of Joey and Chandler&#39;s frequent hugs, moments in cozy armchairs watching football, and Ross&#39; longing for Rachel -- it all came from knowing that men can definitely relate, even if they often hold back, fully to their feelings to explore.
As one counselor told me:... &quot;my listening role to people who are feeling depressed and suicidal really showed me how even the smallest interactions from friends can make a difference.&quot;
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying &quot;I can handle it&quot; has a tremendous impact, as does the feeling that speaking about problems openly is perceived as a weakness.&quot;
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when trying to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
She clearly presents the small moments of male friendships.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of desperation, long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
So if you&#39;re attending Comedy Central&#39;s FriendsFest this weekend with a completely redesigned backdrop to celebrate the day, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give them a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends will air on Comedy Central from start to finish - the entire 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores to help PSG crush Malmo
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Di Maria scores in his Champions League debut on Tuesday, helping PSG pass Malmo.
Here is the game report and reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani stayed the course as Paris Saint-Germain kicked off their Champions League season with a very comfortable 2-0 win over Malmo at the Prinzenparkstadion on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his Champions League debut as a PSG player who launched the French champions but after that they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani struck in the 61st minute. scored a header goal in the minute.
With Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk also in Group A, Paris need a strong start against the Swedish champions as they seek not only qualification for the knockout stages but an improvement towards the quarter-finals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn&#39;t a classy game from Laurent Blanc&#39;s side with Zlatan Ibrahimovic&#39;s missed chances in front of goal. He was later substituted off in the game against his hometown team and against the club with which he began his illustrious career back in 1999.
&quot;It&#39;s not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so winning 2-0, causing problems for our opponents and looking back with confidence is a good start, even if there are certain things we&#39;ve learned over the course of the game of the season still have to be perfected,&quot; said Blanc.
&quot;That&#39;s a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn&#39;t score another goal or two.&quot;
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of three changes for the Paris side, who held a 2-2 draw on home ground against Bordeaux in the Premier League at the weekend, but he was outmaneuvered by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine winger was dubbed as the man who can take PSG to the next level in Europe when he was acquired by Manchester United last month and he hinted why when he ran into Marco Verratti&#39;s pass behind the Malmö defence , before finishing nicely past Johan Wiland into the far corner of the net.
However, if anyone thought PSG would pull off a big win, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who beat Celtic in a play-off to reach that stage, started with nine internationals on the field and were tough opponents with a five-man defense and two lined up deep in midfield.
But apart from a shot from Nikola Djurdjic that went wide of Kevin Trapp&#39;s post in the 34th minute, they offered little in attack.
Instead, PSG gave themselves up at times, with a few bad passes and poor finishes, not least from Ibrahimovic, who blundered on no fewer than five tries in the first half alone and then was abandoned after Cavani used him after the restart.
Still, he showed far more skill when putting his team-mates into play and it was an Ibrahimovic pass that Di Maria converted into a turning shot that was deflected wide by Wiland in the 52nd minute...
The second goal finally came just after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic fished in Maxwell&#39;s left cross.
That put an end to any thoughts of Malmo getting back into the game and only a superb intervention from close range by Wiland to stop David Luiz kept the final score low before substitute Ezequiel Lavezzi had a goal disallowed at the end.
Malmo manager Age Hareide later admitted PSG were playing a notch above his team and the Norwegian said: &quot;Our last Champions League game was in December last year.
Since then we&#39;ve only played in the Swedish league, which doesn&#39;t have the same level.
The qualifiers are not enough.&quot;
Hats off to Paris!
It was a great game from them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through share sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, battered by collapsing commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday through a share sale as part of its huge debt-repayment plan.
London-registered company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold around £1.6 billion worth of new shares to pay down its own debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling as commodity prices fall as China&#39;s economic downturn squeezes demand and devastates markets.
The rights issue sent Glencore&#39;s share price soaring to the top of the London Stock Exchange in early Wednesday morning trading.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore last week announced the $2.5 billion share sale as part of broader plans to pay down around a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new holdings at 125p per share, a 2.4% discount on Tuesday&#39;s closing price.
It sold 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns over long-term stunted growth in China have cut iron ore prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices are down 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arrive in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people reached the city administration in Weimar after a mostly long flight.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping&#39;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States later this month, the White House confirmed in a statement Tuesday.
The visit, Xi&#39;s first official visit to Washington, will take place on September 25 and reciprocates President Barack Obama&#39;s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
&quot;President Xi&#39;s visit will provide an opportunity to expand US-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common concern, while also providing President Obama and President Xi with an opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement,&quot; adds the statement.
XI, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to meet several US technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a range of contentious issues, including Washington&#39;s concerns over alleged cyberespionage by China and its growing assertiveness in disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Borrowed a 440 hp sports car and wrecked it
A 29-year-old wanted to fulfill a dream and rented a Ford Mustang.
Then came the rude awakening on the rain-soaked Autobahn.
With a company in the district of Gotha you can fulfill your dream and rent and drive a V8 US sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
A 29-year-old from the district of Gotha did the same.
The dream was over on the A 71 near Arnstadt.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, skidded on the wet road and crashed into the crash barrier.
The sports car was totaled, no one was injured.
The property damage is estimated at EUR 40,000.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented a move to Bayern Munich in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for the al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since the summer of 2015
FC Bayern was obviously about to sign Spain&#39;s superstar Xavi, who was playing for FC Barcelona at the time, a few years ago.
Eight-time Spanish champions, three-time cup winners, four-time Champions League winners, two-time club world champions, two-time European champions, one-time world champion - Xavi&#39;s list of titles is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was about to leave Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship.
&quot;I was told that Barça wanted to sell me.&quot;
&quot;Madrid won everything back then, we nothing,&quot; he says.
And that was also registered by FC Bayern.
Xavi: &quot;There was an offer from Bayern.&quot;
&quot;Rummenigge wanted me.&quot;
As a reminder: In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn&#39;t move
However, the change did not take place.
And the man who made the difference today works for the German record champions: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explains why: &quot;Barça signed Guardiola and I played a great EURO.&quot;
&quot;Pep told me I wouldn&#39;t leave, that he couldn&#39;t imagine the team without me.&quot;
&quot;That&#39;s how he got me.&quot;
Who knows how Bayern&#39;s 2008/2009 season would have gone with Xavi.
Xavi stood for Barca in the quarter-finals of the Champions League against Bayern for the entire distance on the pitch, knocked out the Reds (4-0, 1-1) and finally celebrated the premier class triumph.
Matt Damon downplays diversity in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity, saying she wasn&#39;t needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO&#39;s Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown when she emphasized the need for alternate perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the project&#39;s chosen script.
&quot;When we talk about diversity, do it with the cast of the movie, not the cast of the show,&quot; Damon assured.
Brown reacted in shock, offended disbelief and exclaimed &quot;Hoo! Wow. Okay&quot; as The Martian actor&#39;s comments solidified.
Damon and Brown joined fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show&#39;s finalists.
&quot;I want to challenge people to think - whoever the director is going to be - about how they treat the character of Harmony,&quot; Brown said.
The only black person and she&#39;s a hooker who gets pounded by her white pimp.
The Dear White People producer lobbied finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the director&#39;s rights to the film; Damon countered that directing her &quot;might end up giving us something we don&#39;t want.&quot;
After the discussion aired, social media exploded in disapproval of Damon&#39;s comments.
Twitter user Mr Pooni expressed his anger at the clip, writing &quot;Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain diversity to her - this is SO WHITE it hurts&quot;.
The tweet earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since it was posted.
Damon&#39;s comments come at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of societal debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement had a national impact, urging lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince made a nod to the movement during the presentation of the nominated Album of the Year at the Grammy Awards.
&quot;Albums still matter,&quot; he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released a statement in response to Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck asking if the group should be considered a hate group.
&quot;The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,&quot; the leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the Catholic Church&#39;s portrayal in the West.
Whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
&#39;American Ninja Warrior&#39; crowns first champion
Professional rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win Monday night&#39;s American Ninja Warrior, taking home the $1 million grand prize.
The competitive show, which just wrapped up its 7th season, had never seen a contestant complete all stages of their obstacle course.
During the season finale, two men, Caldiero and cinematographer Geoff Britten, made it to the final.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task on time, becoming the first athlete to complete the grueling Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior. However, Caldiero finished this challenge a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E! News after the hard-fought win, still in shock at winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
&quot;I mean, it&#39;s amazing to think about, I&#39;ve never made or had more than $10,000 to live on,&quot; Isaac told E! over his pile of money.
So all of a sudden.. how I can&#39;t even imagine what it&#39;s like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why, despite being the first to finish the course, Britten doesn&#39;t receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
&quot;If there is more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it,&quot; Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful prize and life changing, he receives the great reward.
I don&#39;t think he holds any grudges about it.
He&#39;s so happy right now that he did what he did.
He received tons of awards from fans.
He&#39;s such a great guy and a family man.
He&#39;s a hero to his kids and his wife.
Geoff said to me, &quot;If anyone hits me, I&#39;m glad it&#39;s Isaac.&quot;
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they reversed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been renewed for an eighth season, with filming slated to begin in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneak past Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season wasn&#39;t particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once one of the best teams in baseball, the Tigers are now bottom of the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played that part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins squandered a one-half promotion opportunity with the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard berth.
For Detroit, if only for one night, it was a return of the three letter F-word that had been so elusive for much of the second half of the season.
&quot;All wins are fun no matter what,&quot; said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger pitcher Alfredo Simon kept up his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth, and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) served 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third successful start in his last nine games.
&quot;I want to end this year strong,&quot; said Simon.
It&#39;s hard to shoot every game in the bullpen, so I want to go into the game very focused.
Designated Tiger hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez&#39;s first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
&quot;He swung the bat well,&quot; Ausmus said.
He looked good in (batting practice), looked a lot better in the bullpen, and he put it right into the game.
With three runs behind at the end of the seventh inning, the Twins had their best chance of getting back into the game.
Center fielder Byron Buxton ended the inning with a double at left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks caught a bunt, and Simon struck out second baseman Brian Dozier before being replaced by left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy ran over Mauer, the only man he faced, ahead of designated rookie hitter Miguel Sano, who snatched a two-run from right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second, Verhagen got third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was a major league-leading 27th time this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an insurance run at the bottom of the ninth inning, Mauer hit an RBI double on Tigers closer Bruce Rondon to make it 5-4.
However, the right-hander outpaced Sano on three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited from a still unmoving Phil Hughes at the start of the game.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran, who was taken off the pregame injury list after missing more than a month with a back problem.
&quot;Obviously not the start I wanted,&quot; Hughes said, &quot;but I felt more comfortable when I got going and felt like I was going to throw some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.&quot;
After receiving the leadoff batter in the first, Hushes dropped a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for JD Martinez brought in Victor Martinez, who hit a single up the middle on the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez maintained his 0-21 winning streak with the runners in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed up with a single down the right, creating another run, but Victor Martinez was knocked out trying to get to third, ending the threat.
The Tigers advanced in the second, hitting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Gose to make it 3-0.
&quot;It was a big blow,&quot; said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn&#39;t hit very well, but he got the spot right.
Hughes was on a pitch count, not scoring in the third inning before being replaced by reliever right-hander AJAchter.
Hughes had three runs with six hits and one walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez retired with a throwing shoulder injury.
He is given by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez&#39;s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, on the injured list since mid-August because of a shoulder strain, is scheduled to be activated for Wednesday&#39;s start.
With Sanchez out of the game, LHP Daniel Morris is left off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in a July 30 exchange with LHP David Price
He has been out since August 20 with a right hip strain.
The Tigers and Twins will end their three-game streak at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will play Minnesota&#39;s RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73).
Hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
A train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected on Wednesday night.
The people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency accommodation in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
She reckoned with 450 to 750 arriving refugees.
Several sports halls in the Hessian state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days.
Up to 1000 refugees can be accommodated there temporarily.
They should then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the past ten days alone, according to the Gießen regional council responsible for the initial reception, 7,500 people had arrived in Hesse.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency shelters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military action in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, considers military measures with German participation in Syria to be a possibility.
&quot;I believe that decisive reflection on options for military action must not take place without Germany,&quot; he said.
He accused the European states of &quot;collectively looking the other way&quot;.
Four years ago, people were happy that the cup of military participation passed by Germany.
&quot;Now the conflict is crashing down on our doorstep,&quot; he said on Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for the refugees.
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has reintroduced controls on its southern and eastern borders.
The Austrian Minister of the Interior, Johanna Mikl-Leitner, said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television channel ORF that no one would be sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not sent any refugees back to Austria either.
&quot;No, that&#39;s agreed,&quot; she explained.
On the question of an agreement under which Germany could take in a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said talks had already taken place between the Director General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give specific figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin.
In the past few days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria from Hungary via the so-called Balkan route.
Their destination is usually Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian colleague Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, have requested a special summit for next week.
Germany began temporary border controls on Sunday.
So far, the EU countries have not been able to agree on a common approach to the crisis.
At a special meeting next Tuesday (September 22), the EU interior ministers want to make a new attempt at the binding distribution of a further 120,000 refugees.
In view of the strong influx of refugees in Germany, the federal government wants to give the federal states more support in the initial reception and distribution of people.
The federal government will manage this together with the states, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of consultations with the prime ministers in the chancellery in Berlin.
Merkel emphasized that those people who need protection will get it.
But if you don&#39;t have the prospect of staying in Germany, you can&#39;t stay in Germany either.
This view was clearly shared in the group.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole now had to cope with a &quot;huge effort&quot;.
Thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route.
Hungary closed its 175-kilometer border with Serbia on Tuesday night.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also fence off the border with Romania.
Unlike Serbia, this neighboring country belongs to the EU.
Hungary wants to prevent people smugglers from looking for alternative routes via Romania, said Hungary&#39;s Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto on the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, meanwhile, according to eyewitness reports, thousands more migrants made their way to the Greek border.
Cassini spacecraft finds ocean on Saturn&#39;s moon Enceladus
A global ocean sloshes beneath the ice sheet of Saturn&#39;s moon Enceladus.
Researchers conclude this from observations made by the Cassini spacecraft.
Accordingly, the moon wobbles slightly on its orbit around the ringed planet.
This wobbling movement is small, but still too large for a continuously fixed celestial body, according to a statement from Cornell University in Ithaca (US state New York) on Tuesday.
The researchers present their analyzes in the journal &quot;Icarus&quot;.
It has long been known that there must be liquid water beneath the Enceladus ice sheet.
In 2006, for example, &quot;Cassini&quot; discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn&#39;s moon that spew water vapor and ice particles and thus feed Saturn&#39;s so-called E ring.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, the astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear.
Rama is missing 1860 Munich for several weeks
1860 Munich will have to do without offensive player Valdet Rama for around a month.
An investigation revealed an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the club said.
Rama had complained of pain earlier in the week.
According to the Munich Lions, the diagnosis means &quot;probably a four-week compulsory break&quot;.
&quot;That hits us hard, Rama is a great loss.&quot;
&quot;Of course we have to think now,&quot; said sports director Necat Aygün of the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a non-club professional.
As a training guest, however, the sixties initially presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and was previously under contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian currently has &quot;the opportunity to prove his skills&quot;.
Goalscorer Rubin Okotie can return to team training next week after suffering a concussion.
The Austrian national player should start running training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured his head in a violent collision in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3).
Contrary to initial fears, he remained without a serious injury.
Not a diet fruit - Mangoes are high in sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But if you want to keep your slim figure in mind, you are often advised not to use them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively large amount of sugar - especially sucrose.
The exotic fruits are still healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. Above all, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruit thus support their eyesight, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When bought, mangoes should not be too soft or too firm and should smell pleasant.
Skin color alone doesn&#39;t tell you how ripe the fruit is - so green mangoes can taste delicious too.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then they taste naturally pure or in sweet dishes.
A mango also gives hearty dishes a special touch.
It softens the slightly bitter taste of some leafy salads such as chicory and radicchio.
And a mango chutney goes well with fish, poultry, lamb and game.
The US parcel service UPS is again hiring up to 95,000 temporary workers for the Christmas business in the USA.
The company has already started recruiting seasonal workers, UPS announced on Tuesday.
Above all, drivers are wanted.
Last year, UPS increased its workforce by 95,000 for the holiday season.
Given the boom in online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been taking early precautions to be prepared for the holiday shopping season since last year.
In 2013, late deliveries brought harsh criticism to the parcel services.
First a foehn storm, then a distinctive cold front
In the coming night, the foehn will break through in the valleys on the north side of the Alps, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and Thursday night, the foehn will blow through the foehn valleys at times at gale force.
After the end of the föhn on Thursday morning, a distinctive cold front will cross us, bringing heavy rain, gusts of wind and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low-pressure area over the British Isles in a strong south-west current.
On the north side of the Alps, the foehn will break through the valleys on Wednesday night.
As a result, the foehn will blow in the foehn valleys with gusts of 60 to 100 km/h until Thursday morning, occasionally and especially in Urnerland sometimes with over 100 km/h.
In some places, the foehn can reach the neighboring central plateau, and hurricane gusts of over 120 km/h are even possible on the mountains.
While in the north on Wednesday a stormy foehn brings summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, the humidity on the southern flank of the Alps is beginning to build up.
Rain sets in here and lasts until Thursday evening.
In total, over 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours, after large amounts of rain have fallen in recent days.
On Thursday morning the foehn will run out of air, as a result a cold front with heavy rain, sometimes with thunderstorms, will roll across Switzerland from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind freshens up strongly to stormy and the temperatures drop significantly.
The following days will be autumnal in the north with 15 to 20 degrees, while in the south it will be sunnier and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Almost 500 years after the Reformation, Rome now has a Martin Luther Square.
In the presence of Mayor Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on Oppio Hill was christened in the name of the German reformer on Wednesday.
On the &quot;Piazza Martin Lutero&quot; he is now being honored as the &quot;German theologian of the Reformation&quot;.
The park is located in the heart of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The naming was requested by the Working Group of the Protestant Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran congregation in Rome, recalled on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes, as a minority, were often only able to practice their faith in secret for centuries.
The square symbolically shows that their tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) stayed in Rome for a few months as a young Augustinian monk around the turn of the year 1510/11.
At the time, he saw the city as a degenerate babel of sin.
According to historians, his negative impressions may have encouraged him in his later fight against Rome.
With his theses against the sale of indulgences, Luther then initiated the split in the western church.
Hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (gilded) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts.
In the beginning was the Word?
No, not with the Otmar Alt Bible, which has now been published with magnificent pictures.
In the beginning was the picture for Otmar Alt, who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs.
The 75-year-old has retained his &quot;language&quot; with bright colors and imaginative shapes - but this is by no means synonymous with &quot;funny&quot; pictures.
On the contrary: Adapted to the respective topics, it can seem quite gloomy.
Otmar Alt worked on his Bible project for around three years, for which he made a subjective-artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot;Book of All Books&quot;.
Cycles were created that deal with topics such as the Way of the Cross, plagues, commandments or the Lord&#39;s Prayer.
In doing so, he spontaneously fascinated several partners: This applies to the Luther publishing house with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler publishing house with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of the painting.
He interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus &quot;translated&quot; them into today&#39;s current context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alt&#39;s paintings.
They are embedded between the original quotation from the Bible by Martin Luther and a sentence by the artist, who is formulating his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The decorative binding has golden letters.
In this way, the 75-year-old allows a deep insight into his soul and his emotions in two ways.
That&#39;s a high level of intimacy.
Ultimately, emotions were what triggered the Bible project in the first place: Otmar Alt, born in Wernigerode in 1940 and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Moravian Order.
&quot;The education used to be done with a cane,&quot; remembers Otmar Alt.
&quot;I tried to work through that, so that I might get along with my father again.&quot;
His second concern is to help art regain its status in fast-moving times: &quot;Today, the perception of visual worlds is shaped by advertising, and it&#39;s loud.
Symbolism is suppressed there.
Artists have a different lust and delight in showing things.
Pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
&quot;In that sense, I&#39;m a dinosaur&quot;.
Otmar Alt wants the viewer to &quot;fall into&quot; the pictures, let them affect them, discover and feel the power they have: &quot;The picture looks for its counterpart&quot;.
Klaus Altepost admitted on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar Alt Bible in the Otmar Alt Foundation that he had &quot;always&quot; been a lover of Otmar Alt&#39;s art: &quot;I like how he understands life with his pictures&quot;.
Alt didn&#39;t make sure to fully understand the Bible, but chose the topics that were important to him and also mysterious.
&quot;It wasn&#39;t an equal partnership,&quot; says Altepost: &quot;This is about the pictures, the text just explains.&quot; A picture Bible was created.
For Hans Möhler from Luther Verlag, this work is an invitation to &quot;deepen your life and find freedom&quot;.
For Möhler, Otmar Alt&#39;s pictures speak both the (biblical) language of love and that of responsibility.
Some of the originals - paper and canvas pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on November 15 at the Otmar Alt Foundation.
Start of construction for BMX track is approaching
Plans made, space found, companies commissioned, mounds of earth modeled for a circuit: A year later almost everything was finished - but that was already over before the official opening of the BMX track.
Failures in politics and administration caused annoyance, especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway.
So down the hill, looking for a new place - now with formal planning and application for a building permit.
The first municipal councilor Sabine Mosebach-Bock was able to announce that the approval will be received in October in the children and youth committee.
&quot;I hope that something visible will happen this year,&quot; she said.
Work should then begin on the former indoor pool without &quot;another commemorative break&quot;.
DFB intensifies commitment to refugees
The DFB extends its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga sends a clear signal at the weekend.
Football is reacting to the worsening situation in Germany and is assuring politicians of its help in overcoming the problems ahead.
&quot;I think that&#39;s our country&#39;s biggest challenge since reunification.&quot;
&quot;In principle, nobody can say that it&#39;s none of my business, I have nothing to do with it.&quot;
&quot;Everyone must be interested in getting this issue under control,&quot; said DFB boss Wolfgang Niersbach.
At the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany in depth.
&quot;I&#39;ll be in the chancellery next Wednesday and will meet Minister of State Ms Özoğuz and the chancellor there.&quot;
&quot;The topic will certainly play a central role there,&quot; he announced.
Football can and wants to help.
But it is up to politicians to set the decisive course.
The German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot;1:0 for a welcome&quot; by four years.
&quot;Through the Egidius Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019,&quot; said Niersbach on the fringes of the UEFA conference in St. Julian&#39;s/Malta.
Some Bundesliga clubs also support this program.
This weekend, the 36 professional clubs are already making a clear statement when they wear the imprint &quot;We help - #refugeeswelcome&quot; on the left shirt sleeve instead of the usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
&quot;We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can,&quot; said Leverkusen&#39;s sports director Rudi Völler of the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as &quot;a matter of course&quot;.
&quot;The refugee drama affects everyone, nobody is allowed to look away.&quot;
&quot;We Bundesliga clubs can, no, we have to use our charisma, our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,&quot; said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim&#39;s managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a &quot;prominent sign of the league&quot;.
The women&#39;s national team is inviting 100 refugees to Halle/Saale for the European Championship qualifier against Hungary this Friday.
Niersbach described the support for refugees as &quot;a major joint effort by German football&quot;.
It&#39;s great that all 36 license clubs have started their own projects in their localities.
It&#39;s just as great that small and very small clubs are active there.
The &quot;1-0 for a welcome&quot; message that we put out is lived in football.
&quot;This is of enormous importance,&quot; he said.
This year and next, the association, together with the DFB selection team and the federal government, is making 300,000 euros available for the integration of refugees.
&quot;The clubs have already called up the entire sum for 2015,&quot; reported Niersbach.
Reports: SAP CEO loses an eye in accident
According to several reports, the CEO of Europe&#39;s largest software company, Bill McDermott, lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs at his brother&#39;s house in the United States, after midnight, he fell on a glass of water that he was carrying in his left hand, reports the &quot;Wirtschaftswoche&quot; on Wednesday.
&quot;He almost bled to death, passed out, then dragged himself out onto the street - he told us that last week,&quot; quotes the &quot;WiWo&quot; SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
But McDermott can go about his work.
&quot;We will meet in Walldorf at the beginning of October before the Supervisory Board meeting,&quot; said Plattner.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and &quot;fully able to work&quot;.
In an interview with the &quot;Süddeutsche Zeitung&quot; (Thursday edition), McDermott announced that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
&quot;I am fully there for SAP, fully in my job.&quot;
&quot;Of course I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Hasso Plattner the whole time,&quot; McDermott told the &quot;SZ&quot;.
McDermott usually commutes between Germany and the United States, but he hasn&#39;t been to SAP&#39;s German headquarters in Walldorf since the summer.
It is important to him to go public with such a personal story, said the manager of the &quot;SZ&quot;: &quot;Something like this can happen to anyone.&quot;
&quot;It&#39;s important to get up again after you fall.&quot;
McLaren backup driver Magnussen out of action...
Magnussen tweeted a related photo and explained that he suffered the injury when he fell off his bike.
He is therefore just as out of the question as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at the night race in Singapore at the weekend, as he is at the Japanese Grand Prix a week later.
Football: BVB without Reus against Krasnodar: Weidenfeller in goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes of a comeback from Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally been dashed.
The national player will also be missing from the Bundesliga leaders in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (7 p.m. / Sky).
&quot;Unfortunately we can&#39;t fall back on him,&quot; said Thomas Tuchel on Wednesday.
The BVB coach left open whether Reus will be back in the top Bundesliga game against Leverkusen on Sunday: &quot;We expect him to return to training on Friday&quot;.
In view of the high pressure on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his starting eleven in the Reus position.
So he announced a change in the goalkeeper position.
That&#39;s why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of regular keeper Roman Bürki.
&quot;He&#39;s training at an absolutely top level,&quot; said the soccer coach in praise of the world champion.
However, Tuchel left open whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future.
It is very likely that he will also play the second game.
Midfielder Julian Weigl considers the bold statement by teammate Reus that BVB should be aiming for the final in the Europa League to be understandable: &quot;Marco is not that wrong.&quot;
&quot;I think we have a good chance of taking the title.&quot;
Robot cars: the government wants Germany to play a pioneering role
According to the will of the federal government, Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet approved a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA motor show of a &quot;new mobility age&quot;.
Automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic jams, said Dobrindt.
He also wants to discuss the topic with his counterparts from the G7 countries, who are also meeting with industry representatives at the IAA.
The strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphasizes, among other things, the importance of mobile broadband expansion and a rapid switch to digital radio.
A test track is currently being built on Autobahn 9 in Bavaria to test new technology.
So that the driver &quot;is not burdened with any additional liability risks&quot;, the federal government wants to &quot;review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt it to the new developments&quot;.
For example, Germany wants to work internationally to increase the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour.
The federal government also wants to work for a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
In automated driving, the car is increasingly taking the lead, and the driver is increasingly becoming a passenger.
The technology is primarily based on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process the data in a matter of seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are &quot;not to be expected until well after 2020&quot;.
The authors of the study estimate the added value in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany to be around 8.4 billion euros in 2025.
&quot;The digital networking of cars can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic,&quot; said SPD traffic politician Sören Bartol.
However, the question of liability in the event of accidents and the security of the drivers&#39; personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans are still skeptical about self-driving cars - much more so than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute presented on Wednesday at the AA on behalf of the testing organization Dekra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomously driving cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent do not expect it for 20 years So, 31 percent don&#39;t believe in it at all.
In France, 21 percent of those surveyed expect autonomous cars by 2025, in the USA 33 percent.
In any case, drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to relinquishing control throughout the journey on all roads.
At least 15 percent could imagine that on the freeway in flowing traffic, and 45 percent in traffic jams.
A good one in four would under no circumstances let the car take control.
Boll cancels team and double start at table tennis championships
According to the current status, the Düsseldorfer only wants to play individually in the title fights from September 25th to October 4th.
The final decision should be made by September 22 at the latest.
&quot;It&#39;s a huge loss for our team.&quot;
&quot;The boys found out in the morning.&quot;
&quot;But we are strong enough to win the title even without Timo,&quot; said national coach Jörg Roßkopf during the European Championships course in Düsseldorf.
At this time, Boll was en route to a long-term sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected back on Friday.
&quot;Without Timo it&#39;s a disadvantage, we&#39;re not such a clear favorite anymore,&quot; said individual European champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov.
The man from Hamelin, who leads the seed list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the EM 2013 in Schwechat.
&quot;Timo was also absent then and we became European champions.&quot;
&quot;We should be guided by that,&quot; said the fifth in the world rankings.
Manchester United&#39;s England international Luke Shaw has suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit by a tackle from Héctor Moreno and substituted after long treatment.
The first diagnosis pointed to a tibia fracture in Bastian Schweinsteiger&#39;s 20-year-old team-mate.
Gaultier feels too old to be an enfant terrible
It is a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax figure horror chamber: the designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition about his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: mannequins that look shockingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who became a big star of the fashion scene with Madonna&#39;s stage outfits, among other things - and with the fact that he put men in skirts.
&quot;I can no longer say that I am the enfant terrible of haute couture because I have white hair.&quot;
&quot;It used to be bleached, now it&#39;s real,&quot; said Gaultier.
For the visitors of the exhibition &quot;From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk&quot; (from the sidewalk to the catwalk), which can be seen from September 18th in the Kunsthalle of the Hypo-Kulturstiftung, it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude has changed to a show about himself.
He was actually against it, because: &quot;For me, an exhibition sounded a bit like death,&quot; he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously made stops in Montreal, Canada, and in Paris.
&quot;It&#39;s about so much more than just pretty clothes,&quot; said Kunsthalle director Roger Diederen.
It&#39;s about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the work of the man, who can hardly be overseen, who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship.
The show is not structured chronologically, but it is an excellently choreographed total work of art that required a great deal of effort: a stylist was hired to do the hair for the dolls, for example.
According to curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, the makers carted 14 tons of material to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was a special treat: a lederhosen outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
Gaultier said he was always interested in strong women (&quot;women are smarter than men&quot;) and in people who are a little different.
Gaultier&#39;s old teddy can also be seen in the exhibition.
It stands for the designer&#39;s first tentative steps towards fashion.
As a kid (he wasn&#39;t a good student and bad at football) he dressed his teddy bear in bras and dresses, Gaultier said.
His parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll.
He later taught himself how to design fashion.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier said in Munich.
Of course I bought it later.
He was unable to pay the models for his first fashion show.
They received nothing, but were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelery instead of curtains - Plauen lace as a fashion niche
The long embroidery machines in and around Plauen used to be about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who processed them into blankets and curtains, for example.
That alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, Managing Director of Modespitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of Plauen lace, fashion played a bigger role, but was then pushed aside by the home textiles industry - and is now being rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt gives a few examples: lace in jewellery, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
In general, the so-called vintage fashion, which is based on past style epochs, forms an increasing potential for orders.
Anyone who does not serve a niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market.
With us, they already account for half of all orders.
Modespitze Plauen, along with nine other companies, is a member of the Plauen lace and embroidery industry association.
Only they are allowed to wear the protected label.
In the last 15 years, around 80 percent of sales have collapsed.
Private specialist shops and wholesalers are almost gone.
Our products hardly ever reach customers in this way.
These days, mass-produced goods are manufactured much more cheaply in Asia and are sold almost exclusively through chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the USA.
Enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association also tries to score points with environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer from Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: &quot;Since this year we have had a seal of quality that shows that we produce in an ecologically and socially responsible manner&quot;.
Reinhardt adds: &quot;This also applies to the materials used&quot;.
Graduate designer Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schneeberg branch of the West Saxon University of Applied Sciences in Zwickau - at the faculty for applied arts - and specializes in embroidery and lace.
In order to stand up to the competition from Asia, you have to find high-quality and innovative products.
That takes time and courage.
A tension is created between the freshest ideas of the designers and the companies, which above all have to think economically,&quot; says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
The machine embroiders small balls in some places.
The Plauen master goldsmith Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: &quot;Before, I couldn&#39;t do anything with traditional Plauen lace&quot;.
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex process, she embosses the pattern in silver.
&quot;Many people in the region identify with the topic of Plauen lace - young and old,&quot; says Reuter.
She also delivers to the USA, Australia and Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Plauen and the surrounding area and who want a souvenir.
I see my jewelery as a modern ambassador for Plauen lace.
Disney plans new &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; movie
You shouldn&#39;t touch legends, but Disney still dares to do a new film of its classic &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.
According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, however, it is not about a remake, but about a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical nanny.
It&#39;s about the nanny&#39;s experiences with the Banks family during the Great Depression in England.
It is still unclear who plays Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews.
But the director is already certain: Rob Marshall, most recently with &quot;Into the Woods&quot; in the cinema.
Xi is urging to open the economy more broadly to the world
The economy needs to open more broadly outward to spur growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with steering the reform on Tuesday.
&quot;China should work to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve business start-up strategies,&quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Guiding Group for Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Promoting start-ups and pushing ahead with reforms will bring new impetus and vitality, and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The leadership group has passed a series of policies, including a blacklist regulating market access, relaxing border control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to raise private capital, and overhauling the resident registration system.
Following the statement, a negative list will be drawn up identifying sectors and companies not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in resource allocation, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also relax controls over the powers delegated to companies and allow companies to choose how to conduct their business.
The statement also said China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
More areas will be opened up to private investment in a bid to open up state-controlled sectors.
&quot;The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of leveraged companies and provide better services to them,&quot; the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for permanent residency or the &quot;green card&quot; by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process.
Guaranteeing the right of lawyers to practice their profession and appointing professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed at a meeting.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU wants to double mercury limit in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish and thus expect consumers to take a significantly higher dose of the nerve toxin.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a corresponding working paper from the EU, sharply criticized the plans: &quot;Risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on to pregnant women and small children with full force,&quot; explained Matthias Wolfschmidt from Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values for the neurotoxin for large fish at the end of the food chain, such as sharks or swordfish, are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for &quot;political economic reasons&quot;.
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily contaminated with mercury that around 50 percent of the catches cannot be sold based on the current limit values.
After doubling the limit values, only 14.5 percent would be unsaleable.
In return for this easing, according to Foodwatch, the EU wants to tighten the limit values for other fish from the current 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
However, Foodwatch described this as a &quot;trick&quot; because smaller non-predatory fish, such as carp, are usually so low in pollution that they already comply with the planned maximum values today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore &quot;a perfidious diversion that only helps the economy,&quot; explained Wolfschmidt.
Mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans and accumulates in the food chain, particularly in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that &quot;even small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system, especially in unborn babies&quot;.
However, the Federal Ministry for the Environment explains on its website with regard to the applicable maximum values that a &quot;health hazard to the general population&quot; is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the burning of coal.
According to a written statement from the Federal Environment Ministry to Annalena Baerbock, member of the Green Party in the Bundestag, German coal-fired power plants emit more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany.
The concentration of mercury in fish, for example in the Elbe, Rhine and Danube, was &quot;permanently and extensively exceeded,&quot; the &quot;Spiegel&quot; quoted from the paper in March.
Last year, Europe-wide warnings about mercury in fish were among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RASFF.
