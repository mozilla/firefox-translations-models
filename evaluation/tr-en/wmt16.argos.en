Professor 911 Calls Girls Friend Kills
The University Professor Shannon Lamb, looking for 911, said the police banged his girlfriend with weapons, and the voice of the police should come to the houses only a little flick.
Lamb noted that the "based dog" is live and possibly sad and can be found on the cell phone of the family of the repaid woman.
The police found a note written by Amy Prentiss's unstable body and a white notebook: "I'm sorry, I was able to return everything to keşke, I liked Amy very much, and it was the only woman who loves me so far," the note that Lamb signed.
Mississippi did not find that Lamb, who gave two online lessons for Delta State University in Cleveland, the police’s favorite history professor Ethan Scmidt also hit the office in front of Lamb and took over 300 miles towards the school campus he thought to kill.
Delta State University said police officer Lynn Buford college officials shot at 10:18.
Lamb’s vahim 911 call also stated that it did shortly later.
At the end of the day a death occurred more: Lamb was suicide when the police approached him.
The students and professors of the school shot were researching that the locked doors push to do this after a day after the reason for the rest of the locked doors.
In addition to both of the state, the details of the students and staff who know about it are skilled, but probably a problematic teacher was drawing the picture.
Students said they were looking forward to entering his course.
A police Lamb in Gautier, where Prentiss died, stated that Lamb had no criminal and judicial record.
Even Schmidt had mentioned as one of the "harika people" who shared academic life from Lamb in a book written.
Both 17 faculty members were listed in the Social Sciences and History Department, and many students have lectured from both.
However, there were signs for mental problems.
Brandon Beavers from students to mentioning Lamb’s praise, he also noted that it’s a worried and nervous person, and “as they have had a problem”.
Another student Mikel Sykes stated that Lamb had stressed at his end of 2014-15 years.
Lamb was asked to leave the disease from the Delta State University by specifying some health problems.
This year only gave two lessons from the internet.
The changes made recently in the recruitment policies of the University were unable to guarantee that Lamb was a PhD degree that he worked very hard to win.
The University Dean William LaForge noted that Lamb is not a problem between Schmidt but "the bark of what you are in mind."
These are now questions that Lamb cannot respond.
After the campus was discharged, the police took permission from Lamb's Arkansas to Mississippi.
Methel Johnson, Director of Adli Investigation in Washington County, announced that his family Mississippi was suicide with only 38 caliber weapons before the arrest of Lamb in the backyard of a house, located in the suburbs of Greenville.
Lamb's car was found in the motorway.
Although Lamb’s reason has not been identified immediately, Johnson noted that Lamb believes that they know what they live in this house.
Lamb grew in this region.
Lamb started working in 2009 in the 3,500 student college of the city with about 12.000 inhabitants and gave geography and education courses.
He received his doctor in the field of education in the spring.
One of the old friends of Lamb described him as a smart, charimatic and fun one.
Carla Hairston said herself 15, Lamb was 20 years old when they met with their partner friends.
With Carla, friends were in high school and Lamb was also one of the great pleasure, trying to teach playing guitar for several years.
He was one of the hearts quickly scored.
Hairston, who is currently under 40 years old, and living in the suburb of Brandon city, said "O came to all the girls when he came to Lamb."
Lamb and Prentiss were presented for some time.
In the call of 911, Lamb said "I killed my wife" and there is no official record on their marriage.
In Gautier there was a dog called Lightning that lives with them in brick houses located on the edge of a river.
The police noted that the condition of the dog is good.
Prentiss's old husband Shawn O'Steen said they were divorced for 15 years ago but they always stay friendly with Prentiss and are currently a 19-year-old girl.
Home Steen said that his daughter was completely destroyed.
She and her mother was two friends.
He said she’s never met with Steen Lamb but his daughter is interested in Lamb’s music and played blues.
With Lamb, Prentiss met three years ago in a summer festival with Lamb.
Then Lamb and Abigail played together in general shows.
O'Steen noted that his daughter's music was written and said.
Prentiss was a nurse working in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bar of dim near Gautier, a barmenity and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, said Mike Shaffer, Lamb and Prentiss, who had at least a number of spectacles, and saw 5 September nights after finished playing our music.
There was no point on the problem.
He said they are quite a happy couple.
Sometimes we cut and throw a line to each other.
Both had a great humid understanding.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, noted that he manages the seminar program for the first classes of the professor Schmidt, who killed, and is an expert in the history of American natives and colonies.
He was married and had three young children.
Emporia graduated from State University in Kansas and was the head of a student solidarity group, which he founded.
On Tuesday night, about 900 people on the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, among them, academicians, university workers, students and candles from local people participated in the steep ceremony.
He joined Schmidt’s wife Liz and his brother Jeff Schmidt to his memorial ceremony, who said the song "Parlak Sabah Star" and "Muhteşem Zarafet".
Classes continue on Wednesday.
LaForge said, "We try to bring our students back."
The crisis ended.
Time to wrap wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans).
This news text was corrected to indicate that the police called the Schmidt after murdering the police called 911 and to reflect it on the fact that the duo was married, despite mentioning the Prentiss as "heat" in the call of Lamb 911.

8 Survey Rakam That Donald Trump Is Serious
Some have tried to label it as a lightening.
Others were prosecuted to him as they were pranked.
And some support for internal explosion.
Some of the Republicers did not work if Donald Trump tries to pull down in surveys, which could not work.
The last 11 national survey showed him Donald Trump’s leadership in double-digit figures, and some begin to ask the real estate emperor’s chance to be nominated.
Of course, in the selection cycle yet early.
None of them does not mean that Trump can win the candidate race of the Republicers.
Experts say that the rise of Rick Perry in 2011 leads to rise for Herman Cain, both could not even win the candidate process in a single state.
And there are many reasons why the overall choice will experience trouble.
However, the Super PAC group of Jeb Bush and the external groups like the Growth Club, are aware of the permanent power of Trump and they start spending their dollars to cycle it.
Here there are some close-time survey results that show that the property empire is not only coming and temporary:
Trump’s preferred rates have changed 180 degrees.
A survey, which was made in the University of Monmouth, immediately before proclaiming the candidate in the mid-June of Donald Trump, showed that two of them from the 10 Republican to the real estate emperor have positive opinion.
In the middle of July, this rate was 40 percent.
Earlier August 52 percent.
Now there is a positive opinion about Donald Trump, six of the Republican.
Three of them are negative opinion from Kabaca 10.
And these numbers are high in early stages.
Over the past week Iowa showed that a survey at Quinnipiac had preferred 60% of the Republicans there.
Two of the GOP selections can be satisfied with the Trump nomination.
In a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, 67 percent of the Republicaners said that Trump would be “coşkulu” or “sweetened”.
Only two of the 10 people said that if they are no candidate, they will be "they".
Only Ben Carson creates enthusiasm at the same level with Trump (this proportion for Trump is 40 percent when he said they will be 43 "coşkulu" on the earth.
Other people near Coşkuya?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of the electoralians states that the Jeb Bush, which is the favorite of the institution, will not be "will not be" or "will be destroyed."
The majority of the Republicans don’t see Trump as a problem.
Donald Trump thinks that the terrorists asked 52 percent of the Republicans asked according to their Monday ABC News/ Washington Post questionnaires while they are criticized due to their show language and insult.
The same figure applies to Iowa, which will be the first party committee of the country, here is 52 percent of the Republicers according to Quinnipac on the last week.
He still thinks that 44 percent of himself does not have the personality to serve effectively and says that six of 10 people in standalone according to ABC/Post did not comply with the White House of his temperament.
Those who choose the Republican start to get used to this idea.
Those who don’t choose a Republican when they wear political expert hats think that Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC survey conducted last week, he said he was the best of Trump, who asked the best candidate to win the GOP nomination.
A change from the end of July, when they deposit the coins of the dörd from 10 to Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal sphere of GOP selections was not clear.
In the last selection cycle in that period, the refugee from 10 people were thought to be nominated by Rick Perry, in response to this, only 28 percent of the last voted Mitt Romney.
Most of the GOP selections are seen that Trump’s choice campaign has been prone to mind.
Even the Latvians around another candidate in the Republicans Trump still renew almost everyone.
Some experts point that the space that is messy can also contribute to the stand out of Trump, and it’s also a fact that the anti- Trump support is distributed among more than a dozen.
However, at the beginning of September, a Monmouth University survey shows that Trump and many Republican candidates cope with a possible match, Trump has always received the support of the majority.
With 13 points of Carly Fiorina, with 14 points of Marco Rubio, with 15 points of Walker, with 19 points of Jeb Bush and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie pass 33 points.
Together with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate that can beat him?
In the event of a possible deal, Ben Carson passes his business man with 19 points.
The majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they’ve decided.
A new CBS/NYT survey published on Tuesday shows that more than half of the electorals that support Trump lock their votes.
The openness may occur so much to change it and no one can say that it will not really change its idea.
On the face said they left the door open to change 46 candidates.
Hâlâ Trump’s largest competitor brain surgeon Ben Carson but they’re two times closer to voting for Trump.
10 He says he is in the same idea with Trump on six immigrants from the Republican.
Two months ago in the campaign announced speech, Donald Trump became the topic immigration at the beginning of 2016 conversations and in the center of the immigrants from Mexico.
Some think that Trump’s very speaking would damage important Hispanic electorals from the Republican Party and rebranding efforts.
However, according to the new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six of the Republicaners say that it is in the same idea with Trump on issues related to immigration.
So Trump seems to stay on my agenda as long as immigration remains on the day.
The fur of the government climbs new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson take half of the Republican votes due to its largely external conditions.
In the new ABC/Post survey conducted on Monday, six of each 10 Republicaners say they want one outside instead of one with government experience.
And they are angry at Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey conducted in Iowa showed that three of them from every four Republicers in Iowa were frustrated to the Republicans in Congress, 54 percent of which were "non-sweetened" and 21 percent were "extremely angry".

Mr. Corbyn said that a spokesperson was standing in his "abusive silence" and appreciates "the heroity of the Royal Air Force in the UK War."
But one of the members of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith said that the BBC Two’s News Night program had to say the leader of the Labor Party, "independent" from the belief to eliminate monarchy.
Due to the differences related to economy, defense and external relations, Mr. Corbyn refused to serve at the top team of the parliament party, less than one of them supported him as a leader.

Islington North MPvekili said that the Prime Minister Questions program is very facadeative, and with "cevap cultivation" the needler will focus on the challenges faced by poverty, inequalities and young people instead of making the word change toast.
Mr. Corbyn said that when he went to travel abroad, for example, Mr Cameron said he would represent Angela Eagle, who minister of shadow trade in Prime Questions program.
Even time, other colleagues also suggested the idea of these curings, and said Avam Kamarasi Sözcağı John Bercow to address this topic.
When it was leader in 2005, Mr Cameron often expressed that he wanted to go away from the "Kukla Game" style politics associated with the Prime Questions program, but after a few years he admitted that he failed.
Since the date published for the first time in 1990, Prime Minister Questions program was used as a basic measuring point to measure the decisions between leaders and the judges in Avam Kamara and their positions between the MPs; in turn some critics expressed that this was cartoonized and needed very comprehensive reforms.

Metcash launched the public campaign to fight against Aldi diarrhea
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and West Australia from a Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and West Australia against 700 million dollars.
Aldi, at the beginning of the next year, two distribution centers in South Australia and Western Australia and its numbers are prepared to open the first of the stores to arrive at 120, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and strive to create the IGA brand with main current and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide fair.
IGA sparkers and suppliers also contribute to brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream manufacturer Simmo and loyal customers with discounts-selling store owners to South Australia football league tickets.
Food, drink and hardware wholesaler Metcash is expected to offer more details about the defense strategy while straighten the annual investor strategy day in September 29.
Risk is big, as South Australia and Western Australia Metcash represent almost 30% of the IGA store footprint and produces higher profit margins than IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
South Australia and Western Australia store owners enjoy a much more powerful market share than they have received in NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with a negatively narrow view and IGA retailers; more than 24% in GA, and 24% in BA.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will deal about 5% of market market market in 12 months after opening their first stores in these two provinces, sales will be taken from the hands of existing players but in general without excuse retailers.
In a report published on this week, Morgan Stanley anaisti Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers will lose $360 million in one year and $250 million to the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on the estimate that Aldi will open 30 stores in the next year GA, and gain $500 million in each market and $600 million in the BA.
Mr Kierath noted that the loss of food and market sales and the high fixed cost base volumes of Metcash may cost about 13 million dollars before interest and tax.
At the same time Metcash, Despite Roy Morgan research recently revealed that IGA customers are the most loyal customers, firstly Aldi and Coles lose market share in eastern states.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash’s food and market sales will be reduced by 2,1% in 2016 in y3,8, 2017, and 2.9% in 2018, which will be able to back the market share from 14% in 2015 to 10,3 levels in 2020.
Last week, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, the leading fund manager Hamish Douglass said that Metcash in a business dish in Melbourne can be deleted in the "most likely in the year".
Metcash refused to respond to Mr Douglass’ comments.
However, it is understood that a member of a Metcash board contact Mr Douglass last week.
The market share of IGA has been back to 14% since 2010, and the gains from the food and market business that supply Metcash to about 1200 IGA retailer have been 43% since 2012.
But wholesaler resists, in Coles and Woolworths every week, it helps IGA retailers to renew their stores by investing more than 150 million dollars per year for shelf prices matching on the product, adding faster growing fresh foods and opening a better private label market series to the public.
The head of the executive board of Metcash says Ian Morrice, price matching and shop renewal programs have started to result and return to the basic snow growth in 2017 for the first time since four years of wholesaler.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by the President of Tennis Australia Steve Healy
Thanasi deserves a lot of praise for Kokkinakis behaviour.
According to Jim Australia head Steve Healy, Thanasi Kokkinakis friend Nick Kyrgios was in the case of accidental damage in the last storm, and deserves a lot of praise from criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented duo, which was normally referred to as "Custom Ks", found Stan Wawrinka under the spotlights that didn't like herself because Kyrgios smashs in Montreal Masters.
In the challenging criticing match played in the afternoon in Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison was divided by two times file arbitrators, Harrison found in the following description: "Wawrinka, I came on Kyrgios, I must go on that child.  "
Kokkinakis, the most recent US Open, potentially seen when breaking the racket in the way Richard Gasquet would love to enjoy, defended faithfully by Healy.
Young player is currently competing for the second task behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the semifinals of Davis Cup along with Sam Groth in Glasgow.
Healy spoke in the form of "I think I feel like enthusiasticly, a little bit of Thanasi was taken into the discussion."
When it closes and lost in the U.S., the first player who broke the rack because he disappointed from himself is not that and I know that Thanasi should also be proud of it.
But in reality, in the US, Harrison and others have managed itself quite well under extremely provocationative conditions, and I think deserves a full praise.
A great team in the environment has a great family and I think it was going a bit more.
Although it was 19 years old, it works extremely mature, very hard and adapts to the team, there is no problem with other players, it is met with gay respect in the locker room, doing challenging training, is extremely balanced and mature, and he deserves judgment in his jeals according to me.
Healy also supported the decision of seeing Kyrgios for significant draws; from Friday to Friday, what is right for everyone was "to get spoiled decision" but began to explain the team to support Canberran to return as a long-term iron.
Healy, "First of all, we want the team to focus on the match, not all the traction around [Kyrgios].
And according to me Nick, Federerer and Murray as people also mentioned, the child rises very quickly, the public is growing in front of the eye and made some horrible mistakes, and deserves all criticism he received, but we try to support him, try to help understand the results of their actions, and sometimes when it is not under spotlight lights, my thought is convenient, thinking in depth that it is best for the team and herself.
European immigration crisis: Hungary announced emergency, covered borders and immigrants
Hungary has covered the southern border with Serbia by proclaiming emergency on Tuesday for the purpose of hacking the immigration flow and observed employees to enter the country from illegal roads.
Hundreds of immigrants in the unbiased region, creating chaos in the border and the Serbian authorities acted with anger.
Immigrants who escape from violence in their country have dried tents on the roadside for a ambiguous period between two countries’ control points and settled in these tents.
But the rages were increasing.
When a police helicopter passes above, the immigrants "Open over!" shouted and the Hungarian agile forces lubricated the police.
Some rejected them as protesting the water and food given to them.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia announced that the migration of Hungary is "can not be detected" when continuing from Macedonia and Greece.
(Sırbistan) wants to be part of the solution not to see damage from this process.
In the coming days Ivica Dacic Prague said Ivica Dacic will be interviewed with Brussels and other countries.
This tension on the border of Hungary-Sırbistan occurs immediately after a day since the 28-country block could not understand on a common immigration policy at the meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share the responsibility of 40.000 immigrants who are attacked in Greece and Italy, and spoke hopeful about the fact that the 120.000 immigrants from Hungary to the end of the next month or year will agree to the EU countries.
The Prime Minister of Germany Angela Merkel and Austria, on Tuesday, called to make a EU peak next week to discuss this immigration crisis facing the continent.
Hungary is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbors will take any concrete step about the topic.
The emergency call given on Tuesday in the two southern regions gives large authorities to close the roads required and fight against the crisis, including speeding up the litigations related to asylum seekers.
On the other hand, the Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter Szijjarto said that after the barbed wire on the border of Serbia to stop the flow of immigrant from this country, he also planned to attract barbed wire along the border with Romania.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata announced that even prisoners were appointed in prisons in the work of barbed wire drawing between Hungary and Serbia.
The last few months, Hungary became an important narrow passage and passage point to the European Union countries and a large part of these immigrants is asylum seekers who escape from wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that there are "economic-purpose immigrants" trying to cross Europe for a better life rather than innocent people who come to escape from battle of a large part of the immigrants coming from - this thought is completely opposite with the views of other EU countries, including Germany.
The laws that are affected by midnight in Hungary bring 4 meters (13 feet) barbed wire over the length of the border of Serbia, as well as severe penalties to human leakages, as well as to make it hurt.
The government spokesperson Zoltan Kovacs in the statement that he made to journalists in Szeged in the south: "The situation caused by the migration in the country, the Hungarian government declares emergency".
Our idea is very clear: The limit is illegally charged.
Even if the military talk has yet been approved by the council, the Associated Press correspondents in the region say that the dog and vehicle soldiers equipped with heavy weapons are seeing here.
Orban’s domestic security consultant Gyorgy Bakondi stated that the authorities have caught 15 people who have crossed the border with 45 people trying to exceed the limit.
They have passed damage to Barbed wires, now they are accused of committing crime according to police negligence and new laws.
The authorities quickly repair the barbed wires.
Hungarian authorities also used a train wagon covered with barbed wires to close one of the passages, while closing the two of the seven border passage points with Serbia.
For the processing of Hungarians, a small metal container in which people were filled with a click on, was also reflected in the main border passage point near chaos Roszke.
If 20 people were able to enter inside, then thousands of left outside.
Another group of immigrants said they will not accept food and water aids until they are allowed to enter Hungary by closing the motorway connecting Hungary with Serbia.
Selection 2016: Hillary Clinton’s superiority to Bernie Sanders was reduced to half in national elections
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton continues its two-digit leadership in the Democratic race for national nomination but You. Bernie Sanders grows to him.
Clinton is currently in the second position with Sanders increased from 27% (%17%) while democtic votes were 47% (falled from 58%).
The Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet described in the Presidential race, takes 15% of democratic votes.
In a long time before the beginning of the main races, most of which democrates did not elect to decide which candidate would support was yet very early.
However, Clinton’s supporters have more robust ideas on their choice rather than other candidates.
Last month, since the CBS News, Clinton loses the floor between a series of demographic groups, on the other hand there are some gains of Sanders.
Clinton is a major difference between women and moderates but this difference is close.
The support between men was greatly dropped and Sanders only follow 5 points back.
Clinton’s advantage of selecting Democrat under 50 years, steamed and then Sanders are now in equal position.
However, Clinton is leading to a great difference in terms of old choices.
Last month Clinton was moving ahead of Sander with two digit steps between liberals, but now Sanders are 5 points ahead in this group.
It states that the national level of democrates will support Clinton with passion if they have about half a party candidate.
A quarter of 15 percent other cut will support him only if no candidate is supported.
A sixty-cut Clinton does not support.
Perhaps never surprisingly, Clinton’s existing supporters tend to support it especially with passion.
Opinions between Clinton not currently supported are more mixed - only the quarter can support him with passion.
The 48 percent of the democrats say they will support Clinton with passion, less Republican candidates speak about Donald Trump ( 35 on earth).
When Clinton asked open-end questions on what Clinton wants to be nominated for their supporters, the answers in the first row have the right experience (in the earth 16), now the idea that a woman has the time to choose from another ( 13 on the earth) and is the best candidate for the job (10 on the earth).
Clinton’s supporters also express the relationship with Bill Clinton (on the earth 9).
Among the criteria specified in the problems being compromised and selectability.
As a vice president who has potential for the President, 57 percent of those who choose Democrat may want to see that in his race, but three of them do not think in this way.
When asked what the second candidate elections for the party to choose Demoktrat, Biden ranks top.
More than half of Clinton’s supports mention that Biden could be the second elections with clear intermediate difference.
If Biden does not enter the Democrat Candidate race, the superiority of Hillary Clinton into Sanders is increasing; in a race where Biden has 20 points, the level is rising to 30 points in a race where Biden is not in Biden.
The percentage of democrat selections see the fifty-five Clinton as the candidate, the best chance to win the overall selection; but this figure has fallen from 78 percent to this level last month.
Despite being the second from this open from Biden, a lot behind, but the percentage of those who see it as the most selectable candidate showed rise.
When asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, Democrats are given in front of selectability.
The candidate to choose a Democrat similarly to the last month or candidate candidate does not seem unacceptable as a candidate for those who choose this primary.
Democratic candidates or candidate candidates perform good performance in some main characteristic among the primary voters of their parties.
Mostnluk Clinton sees Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable, as well as people with strong leadership.
Biden is strong in leadership of Clinton while ranked first among three in terms of integrity.
According to thirty percent of the democrat electorals, Clinton is not honest and reliable, so half of which there is no idea in this regard of 27 percent, telling the same for Sanders (15 on earth).
The democrates choose also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same direction with its own ideology.
There is no idea about the Sanders of the quarter of those who choose Democrat in all criteria.
During the task of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, questions regarding the use of personal email address and server are ongoing, most democrates find the explanation on the subject of choice, and it states that his opinion is not affected.
But this is a different story in the general American public.
The half of the Americans is no longer satisfied with its explanations, only one third is satisfying.
The opinions on this topic of the public were divided in March, shortly after the problem was taken under the lens.
Most American email conversions say that Clinton does not affect the overall views, negative ideas from the other side to 36 percent are increased.
These generally say that the Republicans are spoiled about Clinton, and more than six people in 10 people.
Clinton is still a problem among those who choose their party honestly and reliably, as well as registered electorals: only 32% of them are honest and reliable, while this figure was eight points, since May 15 points.
Two percent of the saved selections do not find it honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of the voters registered in all countries does not find Trump honestly and reliable.
However, both Clinton takes good note on leadership of Trump.
Between six candidates participating in the test, Biden received the best points in the honesty of Carson and Bush.
More Sanders often find honest but as in Carson, most of them have no idea.
351 Error margin in samples from democrat selection 6% points.
Ben Carson is behind Donald Trump in national surveys
According to the newest CBS News/New York Times survey, Ben Carson Donald Trump runs close behind
The new survey shows that the game of about half of the voters of two candidates are not the chance of other candidates
The country-wide Republican electors continue to support Trump in large numbers, which is 23% in the last CBS survey conducted before the discussion on Fox News last month, climbing 27% in the survey described on Tuesday.
However, the support to Carson rose from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson also went fine in demographic groups, the university graduated from Trump, the support between the electorians.
The remaining, Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, except for Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker last month with 10 percent of the support now fell to 2%.
The former Florida Governor Jeb Bush ranks third with the former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and the Florida Senator Marco Rubio 6.

In a campaign stop at Iowa, Trump said the last Saturday "we need energy."
Five brothers are accused of death of Baruch College first-class student
During the month of admission to a brother in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, almost two years after the death of a college student opened murder cases against five people.
New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood attacked in a hard way to Chun "Michael" Deng in a start month in September 2013 and contributed to death by stopping him to hospital according to the police.
The authorities reported that his eyes are connected, a backpack filled with 30 librey sand was worn on the back, and when trying to walk towards the goal in a frozen field, they were constantly wearing a gang.
Mr. Deng complained that he was suffering over time and then lost consciousness.
Pi Delta psychic members sought 911 after Deng was born, and they were waiting for an hour before taking him to the hospital according to the police.
But at the press conference, the Police Commissioner changed the clothes of Deng in the meantime according to Chris Wagner, they wanted to advise their symptoms by contacting Andy Meng, the national head of the brother and the national head of his brother.
Komiser Wagner said, at this point, members started to store personal belongings and put forward from Michael Deng.
He couldn’t revive himself and lost his life in the next morning.
Deng, according to an autopsy report, traumas caused by shocks, which are not sharp in the head, body and hip.
In a description of Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of Deng, many families were destroyed as a result of the ceremonies of Brotherhood, since 1970, at least a student has lost his life in admission ceremonys every year.
Brotherhoods and members must be responsible for this and this step is very important that the authorities jump.
The big jury of the Monroe Town advised the case opening for the first five members with a third degree of murder accusion.
Mr. Meng included thirty two sibling members will be accused of the admission ceremony and punishment for the attack.
Wagner said in a press conference on Tuesday, not only those who are involved in the work, the official or informal organization, if you have the organization that certify it.
Baruch College prohibited brotherhood and the national brotherhood also ended his relationship with this local unit.
What will be when increasing interest rates?
The bull market rises with the rise of Faiz rates and climbs tahvil revenues, the economy also saves the rest.
We know it.
What we know is how long it will happen and how long it will continue.
The history offers very little information, especially in the economy, timing.
The restoring has been extended to 86 months, as the first interest rate rises as soon as 11 months.
The aggressiveness of increasing interest rates of the US Central Bank Fed has been decisive in response to economy and financial assets, although not continuous.
The US central bank authorities strongly emphasize that investors should focus on how much the process of normalization, not when they start to be increased.
A fact that various variables are.
However, netice may think that market participants, interest increase wire roded.
The Capital Economics Global Prime Economicist Julian Jessop said in a note of its customers, "It is inevitable to be interpreted by some of the first interest increase of Fed since the global financial crisis."
On the contrary, we do not expect the US interest rates to be slower to normal, but most of the levels that are still low are seen to be seismic impact.
We can’t say that there will not be any effects.
Based on the past trends, the response that the economy can give some areas:
As seen in the past months on the market, some things that expect to increase interest rates can unbalance for a while.
The effect is not so pronounced when the interest is increased.
Deutsche Bank analysts in a new research on what will happen after the increase of the Fed, "The first interest increase of resources returns is seen to be 12-24 months of pause, which can reflect the pause in the money policy.  "
Nuveen Asset Management analysts, Bob Doll, according to an up-to-date analysis shared in Barron's, the market has been saving sharp rises in the last 35 years, and after 14 days in the face, he is moving on a straight line towards the increase of interest (average 2,6 percent increase) and 500 days later, and in the last six loop, the average return of 14,4 percent.
Deutsche said that the impact on shares is more pronounced in the next stages of the interest increase cycle.
Restorations are a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
The Fed has faced some circumstances that will speed up the non-existent and rewinding before.
The most attention is that gay pure domestic harvested is the lowest level ever for the increase of interest.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the increase of 118 interest rates, which took place since 1950, fell under 4,5 percent only with the domestic harvest of gayri pure from the rated year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was realized at 3,6 percent, it is expected by the very few of which this situation is permanent according to Atlanta Fed, and the third quarter is observed in 1.5 percent.
According to Deutsche, it may be risky to increase interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment and can lead to the question "Is it different this time."
The attention of the market participants waiting for the interest increase of the Fed is this week at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
Although the economist FOMC with most strategists believes that it can confirm an increase in this meeting, the term trade only points 25 percent potential.
In the report, "In the research we made since 1950, all the increasing cycles that took place until the present are in a super rising trend cycle, and the gay pure domestic harvest, after the recovery, quickly reach the peaks before rewinding," said.
On the contrary, this was a reparation in the slowness of the worst withdrawal in the example period.
The current loop was the longest cycle that the Fed has been expected since the last resurfacing - the longest cycle in the registration was 35 months, and the loop we are located within 74. We continue.
Fixed income with unexpected interest increase in the market is also unstable and the layout looks like a nebze source.
The main difference is that the effect is quicker to see if the Fed policy changes the course.
The first increase/fall of the cycle does not change the tahvil returns immediately.
At the end of the Faiz increase cycle, tahvil returns are instantly dropped," Deutsche said.
According to Charles Schwab strategy experts, increases in interest will be straightened by approaching returns between longer and shorter bonds.
We said Kathy Jones from Schwab analysts, which says high return bonds often perform better in such an environment, but "We are careful about reaching the return."
Interestingly, Jones thinks that markets are now adapted to the policy expectations of the Fed.
"In addition to the decline in strength and inflation expectations, the market has a variety of signals that the market is arranged according to more stringent money policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest is increasing, the efficiency curve smooth, expanded credit spreads and increased fluctuation - all features to be seen on the market when it tightens FED policy.
From the wide point of view, companies that make most of their work in the US will win interest rates plus and local products more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies with multipliant will be worse, as the increasing dollar products will make products more expensive in the global market and their debts will be more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report that they prepared for their customers "History, 'quality' stocks can experience performance miscarriage at the beginning of such an increase."
Companies with strong balances have been passed with an average of 5 percent of those with weak balances following the increase of 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low fluctuating stocks have also passed low quality competitors (face) with 4 (face) 3 averages.
Debt will become a big matter.
According to Goldman, companies with a high-wave wolf are most likely to be damaged.
Except the pure stock exchange game, consumers are predicted to benefit from growing dollars.
Although experts have different opinions on how quickly they hold, they can also be profitable from high gains.

Since the rates of FED have passed seven years from zero-download, this situation is a historical event.

Manchester United from Luke Shaw double broken months outdoor
Luke Shaw’s right leg suffered from two fractures in the match where Manchester United’s Champions League was defeated to PSV Eindhoven.
This event of bulling the defender to tears remains hopeful that Louis van Gaal Shaw can return to these seasons at least six months from the sites.
The match that 20-year-old Shaw falls like bombs on the matchfield was caused by the Héctor Moreno in 15 minutes.
It was interfered in the field for nine minutes, and then it was necessary to give oxygen before the hospital was shipped.
Van Gaal said: "In the case of a couple of fractures and at the moment in the hospital.  "
Today or after a day, perhaps will be shipped and will be taken to the operation in Manchester.
Berbat is a young man who is a transfer to Manchester -18 years old, spend hard times first, then take a magnificent game and then come to this.
I had oxygen mask on the face when it was in the dressing room.
He was crying.
I am not a doctor but if you have a double floor, this means at least six months and means that you can not play in the group stage.
I hope this season can be played again.
Moreno was lucky to get rid of red card and penny shot.
The arbitral Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was mistaken.
You can judge yourself when I said that this is a penny and red card.
It was a very bad struggle with two legs.
The tweet on Shaw’s account said: “Thank you for your posts, what words are not enough to tell me what I’m experiencing from the denial, my recovery path starts now, I’m going to return by power.  "

The Champions League, which will be held in France in July next, will be moral to the healing of the British defender.
PSV technical director Phillip Cuckold said: "A very bad disability.  "
If such a disability has come to any player, everyone is sad.
The intention of our players is never to hide the opponent.
Moreno was playing in the Mexican team against Van Gaal’s Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
So, because this situation is very difficult because the intention was never to tame his opponent, and after hearing that it was a very bad broken, he said.
I was not able to see that moment in my angle.
The only thing I can see was the ball that goes to different direction. Sanki Moreno touched him but I couldn’t see Luke’s bush.

I feel very bad for this and I’m too sad.

Of course David Cameron The Lorax knows better than that?
This is something that every parent has learned in a short time: when your child loves a book, you will know that you will not have more time learning it almost to memorize.
If you are not David Cameron.
When he asked what his favorite child book is by a holiday programmer supplier for child care, the Prime Minister The Lorax chose Dr. Seuss in 1971.
In the message published on the website of SuperCamps, Cameron continues: "This book with an impressive, creative and strong message, I love to read my children, since we always host an image or message that we skip on the content.  "
Everything so far was going good, ta ki Cameron wrote something about the content of the book, but in fact, the new character and details added to the content of the original fairy tale text until the paragraph that the 2012-made movie version summarizes.
A child in the name Ted in the city Thneed-Ville, the city with walls that all nature is destroyed, even the meta, wants to perform the desire to see his true tree to win the heart of the girl Audrey in his dreams, he writes, the true name is Theodor Seuss Geisel and died in 1991 Dr. Seuss incorporates a love fairy tale that doesn’t know.
If this didn’t come suspicious enough, then it shows very similarity with the short summary text of The Lora movie in the Internet Film Archive with a text direction that Cameron’s addressed, which starts as follows: "In the city Thneed-Ville with walls that everything is artificial and even a meta, the girl named Ted wants to win the heart of Audrey in his dream.  "
If Cameron is looking for the claims that his work is a ehli parent, Cameron’s bounty in the name of Lorax, who also named the local environment of a unnamed young boy, mustached and "peaking to the name of the trees" is greedy, sack trees, how to do by the network-need Once-ler is very likely to be bihaber from the book that it works.
Most likely, the work of a weak Public Relations with this is aired to a commander, which is also understood that the Lorax has not read 20 times in a child.
A lady from the President’s spokespersons said that the text came from the selection office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text is provided from Cameron’s staff, but there was no comments outside of it.
Adam Lyth was clearly under the risk of removing the UK but still sapasağlam
A demanding task to play with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates but after seeing the British team selected for the tour, there is no repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeats that last time.
I don’t leave a restoring victory again.
The team of Alastair Cook can be more inexperienced than three years ago, but there are good rotating players in the stroke line, and the understanding of collective gameplay is also strong; these do not improve the wounds of 2012, only provide some youth-source optimism.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali is developing as a spinner and Fair Rashid represents an option of a horse, even if the quality of the trial level is not known.

The decision of removing Adam Lyth is a difficult decision to analyze it for me as the head coach in Yorkshire.
Seven Trials were against two good horses in harsh conditions and are simple but inevitable, the cricketians are judged according to the conclusion.
For example, there was no question mark on Joe Root, because it was thickened in case of announcement - as I said earlier - players were their best choices.
After several fifty series, Lyth could see his career extends, but he appointed his own fate.
I hope that if it works more for Yorkshire, I will catch another opportunity.
The UK head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude, although he did not show the best performance, he did not surprise me; first of all he was a teamman.
It’s hard to answer the question of how long it takes out the note of a trial attack.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - took seven kep, from the other hand Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton scored the chance of winning matches.
The only sanitant that you can share may be the first to the Caribbean for Jonathan Trott - while Lyth’s form is peaked - but this wasted opportunity is no longer in the past.
Alex Hales comes and is a high-end muffler according to me.
A cricket with X-phanector, and when it counts 236 against us at the Trent Bridge site at the beginning of this season, we saw in Yorkshire.
At least it is necessary to be taken for the same opportunity before him but this is subject to the formation of teams in the United Arab Emirates.
Moeen’s idea was to do the opening stroke alongside Cook, so that she could get more than a game spiner while holding four quicks and I’m not against it.
I don’t understand why a vuff is not able to shoot here, this left holder has already showed how good it is as cricket.
Moeen could not do its job for the city Worcestershire, but they have seen a 3 number for them, and there is also no much difference.
The former team friend Justin Langer played his first 38 trial in the first drop before starting out in 2001.
The three-faceted series immediately covered and looked behind.
Zafar Ansari comes as a backup game spinner and surprised me as an impressive young man in restricted conversations I did with.
People can see the raw statistics - from 31 average and 35 average on the ball, and think that it is a degaj, but there is no lot of games that lift their hands, and the player's selections have been made since they are young.
This tour will learn a lot of things.
From the team, the UK seems to have made a few wolf add-ons to their coach team.
Sri Lanka’s muffsu Mahela Jayawardene can be a mastery measure for trial matches.
One of the most cute guys of the game will bring together a full experience of all conditions and all attacks.
Paul Collingwood tour comes for white ball foot, giving both energy and game layout a brutal mass.
I’ve always thought that he was born for the international cricket world, whether he wants a player or a coach, and there’s an understanding that can get a guide like Mahela.
Sometimes the new sounds in the dressing room can bring a innovation to the team if even the messages that have been told before.
Colly's team friend from Durham Ben Stokes is rested for a day games, Root was given a similar break against Australia and there is no problem with it.
Not everyone is in the same idea, plans, coaches and players are not built by selecters.
And you should not forget that players like their work depends on results.
Such decisions are never taken easily.
In case the economy is up to 2017, Brexit camp can win
David Cameron’s semi-cooked regotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going to be worse every day and this situation is Jeremy "Yes? No??" Although Corbyn’s leadership of Labor Party or the TUC’s Wednesday is coming out of Europe.
Foreigners also have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
In the EU, the European diplomat stated that some member states are not completely caused by any kind of crisis in the EU, where they did not want most, the UK only self-thinking dividers and things accentuating changes from the agenda.
TUC had the decision that he didn’t want them if he would harm social protection in the annual interview in Brighton.
Even that Dave and George’s own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellants have attracted their own picture, whether they are going to participate in peaks or bilateral meetings in the capitals of foreign countries and get the forwards of the ratio in front of the famous monuments in their islands, then they say they have collected allies to reform their country.
This is completely relevant to me.
While Berlin said "Do not leave us alone with France" the European friend who wants a foreign Britain in the EU tent said that some capitals come to a point where they couldn't care about our mold anymore.
Angela Merkel is an allied ally, which is the chance of Germany at the beginning of the secret and pledge, along with it for 10 years, and Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16) would want to leave the situation without worseing.
François Hollande face-to-face with re-selected or power change in France in 2017.
It’s also a power that fades.
A nationalist government from right cut in Poland will come to a government power from left cut in Spain.
For selfie UKs that need to use its energy to prevent from leaving Scotland, it is not very likely to show a effort of these countries because they don’t want it because they have most discrete trends.
So some of the such ministers can plan to speed up the Brexit process by finding intentional statements that the United Kingdom will not benefit during the 2017 referendum campaign; my friend says this.
"The new negotiation did not come out" and "I did not get anything that will benefit from reconciliation.  "
The Europeans knew how far the fleet of Fleet Street from their previous experiences was, how much EU variegative press bars, as Tony Benn was not on time, they were inspired by the 1975 referendum, confirming our entry in 1973 compared to 1 in 1.
At the beginning of the 90s, Brussels correspondents, "AB flat bananas" said, the head Euro-oportunist Boris Johnson, which remembers such.
Since all the aches are one, Ed Miliband knew who are the enemies.
Among them there were so-called external residences with most of our foreigners and large newspapers that listen to non-governmental phones.
Aunda Tony Blair was mostly thinking of the same things about them, however, in a gorille cage, he understood that he had to distract his attention by giving him a noon dinner and not bait at the time of the pursuit tea.
In fact, Miliband was Blaircı from Blair to the idea of Cameron’s bright referendum, as Blair had concessioned from the principle on the EU constitution, which was cancelled in 2005 by French and Dutch voters giving him the output card.
The press did not forgive him in this regard.
But on Monday, I said that the friendly back in Westminster is not plastering - I have no time to lose me anymore - Jeremy Corbyn, Neil Kinnock, then it seems to be under the danger of reconciliating Murdoch in 80s, which is now a bug.
Although it will take time, it is necessary to develop a consistent strategy to be in contact with Andrew Marr, which is not included in the BBC chair on Sunday, not with me.
I express the official location of Corbyn in Europe as a breakthrough.
The reform says that we want to stay in a EU past.
Most of the people remaining outside the enemy trend of Ukip and the Fired supporters of the conservative Small UKing say that yes.
Already, "A Benn, but Initen" Hilary Benn said this week in radio and television, as a naive way, Corbyn's John McDonnell forced himself to admit that the shade was a bad idea to appoint as luckimeter.
This reminded me of the struggle of his father in the television to his friends in the workplace of the workers in the cabinet, so he did not go forward and lose his work in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But "In's expression - to fight to stay "all conditions" was the same as what McDonnell said and what JC said in the special meeting on Monday night, saying lords to the nations.
If we consider that it touches me, we continue to protect the importance of message discipline in the social media entry, no matter what is the yearly image, 24/7 TV age and bilhassa paranoya and ihanet bed.
As McDonnell said, it is reasonable to take difficulty in Europe, allowing Cameron to guarantee the support of the Labor Party in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks like this.
But the Bennite Siegen economy and anti-capitalist history on the EU membership of McDonnell and Corbyn is no longer just a discussion of the left wings between the basic stones of the teachingal ambitions of small differ narsisism.
As in the transition to Nato - Tom Watson is committed to making a campaign to leave JC - foreign diplomats will have to deal with a mana from them for masters in their country.
Why do you lose political capital in the UK where all can be divorced?
As it was said to me in the opening of the British Impact Security Forum on Monday, the US has already been disappointed with the poor minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria despite the cost-reducing conservative party government in power.
Experts criticize UK Public Health e-cigarette research
The researchers stated that a agency funded by the government did, that they are connected with the tobacco industry, in a meeting of 12 people, e-cigarettes were less harmful than 95% of smoking.
Experts written in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) participated in the UK Public Health (PHE) e-cigarette report.
PHE published the report "the point of departure" defined as a detailed review of the phrases.
But some researchers questioned the strength of data and attracted attention to links between some experts and tobacco industry.
The head of the Lancet medical magazine last month was aimed at "the foundation of superficial decay" based on the main conclusion of PHE.
Another two researchers written in BMJ questioned that the claims were built on the rock or if they were built.
In London Hygiene and Tropical Medicine School, the European public health professor at the University of Martin McKee and Liverpool said Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool: "The main principle of health is that the effectiveness of policies is crazyline.  "
According to the best estimate of the public’s PHE, they said that the claims in the direction of e-cigarette smoking are about 95% less harmful than drinking” would be expected to withstand a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, there is a meeting of 12 people gathered together to develop a multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA) model for creating a synthesis of the views on different products that contain this nicotine; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to fund from the British American Tobacco for an independent research.
They also said that BAT also confirms public health publicity document in a sustainability report.
One of the 12 people in the meeting reported that one receives funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but they also added that it was not the fund previously received from Philip Morris International cigarette company.
The information of how panel members were selected, but among which some of them are included in some giants known by e-cigarette, which reported the industry fund in the article.
Some other people who are ready in the meeting are not recognized by their expertise in tobacco control.
The person who was responsible for the meeting at PHE joined.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the research article "in a way" "a concrete evidence about the damage of most products according to many criteria.
But none of these links or restrictions is not discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said that the claims in the direction of "there is no evidence to have a transition to smoking for children or non-smoking people."
Prof Kevin Fenton, the director of health and welfare at PHE said that the claims in the UNJ were previously answered.
She said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.  "
One of the two people with a lifetime of cigarettes die for this addiction.
All evidence indicates that e-cigarettes are small compared to health risks caused by, but we must continue to review long-term effects.
PHE has a clear invasive: inform the public about what evidence shows and does not show.
Almost 80.000 people per year die from a disease associated with cigarettes and smoking costs 2 billion £ per year.
We carry out our national responsibility by revealing an open way - whether it is not risk-free of e-cigarette, but only a small part of the harm caused by smoking.
Previous Channel 4 chef said BBC should release EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 President Luke Johnson said BBC should release programs such as EastEnders and The Voice and noted that advertising competitors can "will bring their arm" for hits programs such as Albert Square series.
Johnson said that the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British broadcasters.
BBC was criticizing the public service programs that are likely to be watched by a smaller audience group, against the most reyting field programs of competitors in valuable ranges.
After said BBC’s overall director Tony Hall wanted to collaborate more with other organizations of the institution; Johnson said that it was said that in his time in Channel 4 to create a bond with BBC that it failed for six years.
Johnson said that during a query regarding the future of the BBC, the Lords Camarasi communication committee "I struggle with the idea of ordering and publishing programs that can be shown clearly by unstentional opponents."
If you continue the license fee application that I am not sure that there is a good idea in the middle or long term, it is necessary to download programs that the output does not do or order others at least.
The Voice is broadcast in the primetime range because they want to provide a wide support as possible.
The main idea here is based on the thought that no other can be published, which is laugh and clearly absurd.
Johnson said: “I don’t understand why programs that can be funded without assistance should be funded with a reduced rate tax.
The Voice is one of the EastEnders and is done in the company in reality.
To be honest, other channels give the right arms for it.
I am trying to see how public service posts are.
I don’t think this would never be minus BBC.
Johnson, a number of entrepreneurs who manage Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the pursuit of the reyting of the BBC, "because of seeing people working here and this approach of those employees as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
The comments on BBC’s most popular programs repeat the comments of the previous Sky manager Tony Ball, using MacTaggart course in 2003 to offer BBC to sell programs like EastEnders.
Johnson said that BBC’s more convenient public service programs go to BBC4, and here they will not be able to conduct audience measurement but they can discuss and added that they can discuss and discuss to continue to show up to 4 billion grounds in their tax proff and license fee income: "We are doing all these silik programs that no one has followed.  "
They put them on the gaps that nobody can watch at any time.
About the license fee, the Johnson committee said: "I invite you to find a more regresific system in terms of those who have the best benefit from it.
Of course, you always think, we all think, a huge value of £150 per year, but I wonder if there are so many BBC monitorings of the reason they do this for people with a huge amount of £150.
At the same time, the previous Sky and Channel 5 manager David Elstein said that BBC had to revise the Reithian mission for "information, training and fun."
The bit of the BBC’s output is now officially classified as education - said that the TV output is 1% and 0.9% of the radio - and said that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be at the forefront, and this should be replaced as "information, lighting and training".
On partnerships, Elstein said that BBC does something about Proms, which is shown in TV but a handful of, and it should enter collaborations with advertising publishers to ensure that the entire is online monitoring.
'Sonogenetic' allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
How to change direction at the moment they were shot with sound vibrations of yarnworms in the video.
Science have grown maggots with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave explosions.
The tiny threadworms change direction at the moment they were shot with sound vibrations in the thigh that people can not hear.
Vibrations are run genetically modified engine nerve cells in order to carry membrane channels that respond to sound waves.
Related: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers said that maggots have proved the strength of a new procedure called Sonogenetic, so ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brains, hearts and muscle cells from the outside of the body.
The researcher from the Salk Institute located in California, La Jolla said Sreekanth Chalasani Guardian can replace the deep-brain stimulation, an interfering procedure that gives electrical vibrations into people’s brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson’s disease a day.
Threadworms often do not react beyond the sound, but Chalasani found they reacted with a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
Bubbles in which are worn strengthen sound waves and thus allow them to pass through maggots.
Reinforced noise waves affect the structures called TRP-4 ion channels, located in the membranes of some maggot cells.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves enable these ion channels to open and activate the cells they are connected.
In order to create yarnworms controlled by the voice, Chalasani has genetically modified maggots to allow some motor neurons to carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it applied to altered creatures, the sound waves were strengthened by micro-chambers and transmitted into the wolfs and operated the engine neurons, which were replaced here.
This procedure has similarities with optogenetic, a breakthrough tool that allows scientists to run and close neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says that the sonogenetics may have some advantages across this technique.
Unlike the light to be sent along a optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency sound waves can pass through the tissue without obstruction, so they can be sent into the brain through the head.
Chalasani said that using a "gen therapy and a therapeutic virus, for certain neurological therapies, the targeted human neurons in the clinical environment can be temporarily sensitive to sound signals," he spoke.
It also added that other applications can concentrate on muscle cells and insulin-produced cells.

However, a different campaign continues with posters in bus stops and metro trains and requires to look twice.
In one of them, using the London Metro fonts and brand, you will travel to the DLR line tank "Next announcement, between 15-18 September?" says.
This September will attack DLR a lot of weapons vendors... It is desirable to help customers stop this weapon exhibition.
300 posters from artists who exhibit the work at Zalim Designs Museum in Bansky's Dismaland.
A collective called Private Devriye Group helped distribute the "impact Packs" claiming that 6 £, and the bus stop in the "heavy" access to about three of the advertising areas.
Transportation for London was not satisfied with this banner "vandalism".
One of the ads was created by the private giant group collective.
Zalim Designs are curated and the faculty of Essex University according to Gavin Grindon, artists are becoming more questionive every day, and they are looking for ways to move political works to masses outside galleries.
Many artists move together with activists in protest movements and begin to realize that art should go to the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti-counterfeit poster also goes against those traveling in the metro.
The video of the International Af Organization was viewed more than 100,000 on Facebook in 24 hours and created by the VCCP advertising agency that works for free, and the audio artist with graphic designer also prepared for free.
The VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised for the silence against the adverts of weapons - with the empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought: " Let's offer a campaign they tried to escape them.  "
They played with the idea of making a more realistic, tamperless corporate advertising, but they decorated with "bright colors and animations, more remarkable.  "
Tom Davies from Af Organization: "They helped us to create concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment in the window."
Now we need to prevent torture equipment from selling illegally in front of our door by moving the UK government.
Perhaps the most creative art at the weapon exhibition comes from ExCeL inside, here they sell fantastic covering products.
In a press release, Saab showed the order of the US army " AT4CS RS", which was launched from our window.
In this there is a "unique-shaped and battle header" which hits the large impact by passing the armor to the goal.

eight golden rules of living in student dorms
An uninterested 19-year-old teenager was 11 years of student dorms, and I still believe in feeds and moral relative, but now I understand the unpleasant smiles - and numerous length complaints about others.

Since you start college at the peaks of food competition craze, it is less strange and less than 1950s to introduce yourself to a plate with brownie and less than 1950s "Welcome to us, I cooked something to you, now I smile while asking personal questions."

Oil companies officially crashed
Since 2014, oil prices started to fall, the investment of about 400 billion dollars until the end of the last year was delayed, the most deep sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects were suspended.
According to the research of the consulting company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices, oil and gas exploration/production caused by the suspension of the 380 billion dollar project, from Mexico Gulf to Africa, the production of millions of barrels in a wide geography was also delayed.
As the biggest reason for cost interruptions, in the summer of 2014, it is located in the report "the company budgets were dramaticly narrowed" in the report showing the oil prices falling to the lowest level of 12 years.
400 MILLION
While raw oil prices are new surprises every day, the last 12 years’ lowest level has been restored under 30 dollars.
"The oil drops to 15 dollars"; "The oil is now cheaper than the water" discussions are flamed today, the research published by Wood Mackenzie reveals how the sector is affected by falling prices.
Finally, in the report published in July, Wood Mackenzie reveals that the prices of falling oil are suspended by $200 billion in 46 major energy investments, revealing where this figure reaches until the year of 2015 in his new research.
Accordingly, in the last six months of 2015, 22 major projects have been suspended in a total of 68 large projects since 2014.
The value of these projects is about 400 billion dollars.
DAILY 2.9 MILLION
The research highlighted that the impact of low oil prices on company plans is "non-existing" is recorded as deep sea development projects of the most affected projects.
In total of 27 billion barrels of crude oil equivalents in the suspended projects, the daily production of 2.9 million barrel oil until 2025 is delayed.
According to the research, the final investment decision of most of the projects in question is delayed in 2017 and after, the first production targets are also recorded between 2020 to 2023.
Among the 68 projects released, in the report highlighted that the potential investment of $170 billion was included in the next 5 years, "the majority of $170 billion deep sea projects.  "
This is because the pre-investment cost is very high.
"The 70 percent of the sea expenditures are also called oil-weight projects in Nigeria, Angola and USA's Gulf."
According to research, countries with most delayed oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and USA.
This six countries have almost 90 percent of the delayed liquid (petrol) reserves.
Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, which has a large amount of delayed gas reserves, creates 85 percent in total.
When the large part of the natural gas, waiting for to exit in these, it requires complex and expensive development solutions, such as establishing the liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant from scratch.
While the companies exposed to the most danger are noted that deep sea, Canada oil sand and oil giants, which are the commitments followed by each other in the Caspian Territory, companies are also expressed to adapt to the "lower" oil prices scenario.
EYES IN IRAN
Not so four years ago there was a table: the US and Europe brought to Iran oil to stop the nuclear program of Tehran, the barrel price of oil was about 110 dollars, and the export of Iran oil was discussed how to be jealoused without causing a sudden leap at prices.
When we return to this week, we see another scenario.
Oil prices have seen the gold of 30 dollars for the first time since 2004, which was the main reason for the production explosion in the USA and the warehouses applied to Iran are getting up.
Therefore, the eyes on Iran.
In the event that Iran has increased oil exports, it will be more oiled to the petroleum market, which is already quite saturated.
This may lead to the level that surprised us today.
Some analysts will pump more oil than Saudi Arabia, which does not want to cover market share to Iran, and Iran - S. It says that a price battle between Arabia can be experienced.
The main goal of Iran does not get up, Asia’s rapidly growing oil market is recorded as former partners in India and Europe.
The Iranian authorities said that in the explanations they made earlier, the exports in the first place were aimed at increasing 500 thousand barrels per day, and after a while they were able to market the amount more.
According to the map information of Reuters, 22 large crude oil carriers (VLCC), while waiting for them at least 13" full or large quantity.
Iran is located in the country with the largest fourth proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to the exceptions in Iran, exports about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries in Turkey.
The daily oil export of Iran was increased by 3 million per day.
Support Securities Values Research Expert Aysun Göksu responds to the question below 20 dollars: "China-based global growth concerns increase down-way printing on commodity prices, resulting in deepening of loss in oil prices.  "
In China, which is the largest oil importer in the world, we see that the losses have reached 20 percent since the Christmas of oil with concerns that the demand for oil will be reduced in parallel with the economic slowing down in China.
In addition, we can witness pricing under 30 dollars in the coming days in oil with the influence of the global number of dollars and global supply problems.
Permanent pricing on 32-33 dollars levels can be limited in oil as long as we don’t see, and the down-way printing can increase.
At this point, the closings under the critical 30 dollar level can be said to have a key role to continue the declines.
In such a situation, relaxations that last until 23.30-25.60 support zones on the lower side should not be surprised.
Isham Sardouk: 'Melek tip is now!'
Victoria's Secret and the world’s fashion currents, while taking the trend creativity task in WGSN, why did you turn the route to Turkey?
- I am always going to change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, then went to New York.
There were also important positions.
At this time, I started to consult Koton for the last two years.
Then I saw the potential in this geography and Koton brand.
I noticed that everything needed to become a store chain in the world age.
Now I’m here to perform it.
Can you succeed in a short time?
- absolutely.
Despite being a young brand already sells in 50 countries.
We take 50 collections per year, there are 15 separate sections.
That’s all you need to have a store chain.
We can meet the needs of consumers in different geographies from Dubai to Moscow.
Now we open a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting era...
Do I open a store in Paris?
- Yes.
Not because Europe’s economic situation is fantastic.
But you open some stores for image.
Paris, London, like fashion capitals, you earn money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, adds money to the other, two are required for a brand that plays to the globality.
So let’s talk about trends...
- There is a very romantic, fashionable season.
Flighted chiffon dresses, soft tones, pinks, whites, reds.
Patterns...

Cooking in steam, the most preferred cooking techniques in the Far East, makes the metabolism strong and facilitates digestion.
Bacteria and microbes, which are in nutrients, completely eliminate problems such as irregularity, also completely die.
Ingredients such as protein, cellulose and starch in food are completely melted by this technique, which makes the dish more soft.

A deep pot is filled with water at a rate of three and placed into the steam filter cookware.
The mouth of the pot is left to be semi-closed.
Thus, the steam is easily removed from the pot.
The fire of January is first brought to the highest level and the water is lost, then the stove fire is brought to a lower level and a fixed heat is achieved.
Vegetables and nutrients cooked for about 10 - 15 minutes in steam are controlled with the help of fork after thoroughly prying.
The vegetables with nuts are taken from the stove and served in the plates.
The appearance, color and smell of the beech in the steam cooking technique does not change, so this method is healthy.
The unique taste of the food remains the same.
Thus, the quality and flavor of the food is distorted.
At the same time, one of the most economical cooking methods, cooking in steam, food loss is kept at least level.
The vegetables cooked in steam are more diri and offer a satisfying banquet with live views.
This method, which is often used in diet dishes, is often preferred.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The "son" album of Alien
Knowing that he will die; doing that last album without saying it to anyone, making death bed into an artistic expression area in the clip you have taken...
Works like this; we may seem more "fast" for world fans.
I’m saying world fantasies because I’m among those who believe that the man who makes it both unmortal and alienated.
From another corner of the universe came to our World; now it turned back to the moment; those are.
Comed because there was only a inspiration that should be given to all world artists, not only to Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He completed his duty with worthy.

Last game more...
The magnificent "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" that backs the message and the feeling load of the album, but the number of songs we know together with "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "'Tis A Pity She Was A Whore" was published.
I would like to say that "Girl Loves Me", "I Can't Give Everything Away" and "Dollar Days" are very good songs.
When we look at all, it is a very strong musical structure installed on but as it is done with sincerely, instant sensations, "Blackstar"...
Neither death nor a "accounting" album...
Only a real "son" album.

When we need to have a process starting from the 9th grade under normal conditions, we try to complete this in the last 1 year, which is why the last year is more effective, efficient and time for us.
Besides the final student exam preparation, you also have to carry out school written work together.
The student who completed the school has entered at least 1 time exam (YGS-LYS) and even if he has experienced, he is critical for his years to prepare for the test again as a graduate student.
Because most graduate students and their family are seeing as the last chance of ‘O’, which makes a greater stress.
Lesson work; the student does not enjoy, because he feels only compulsory, and therefore it is often the most recent work, but it has become a completely task if it is for students who regularly make it habit, and what time to do is always within a plan.
Now we have a half-year holiday in our front and we must evaluate it in the best way.
For this, it should be a plan that we will always manage our best time.
Lesson Study in Half Year Holiday:
Everyone should make a plan that fits their condition primarily.
1.What was taken care of, what was missing; day, week and 15 days of planning.
In this period, there should be both subject repetitions and question solutions.
At the same time, students who are not too much, can also solve the average 1-2 trial tests.
Halledin: Research shows that 75 percent of people’s learners forget about 66 percent in one week, 54 percent per day.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forget is that it will be done again.
Students who make a lot of errors from past topics should lose their overall work.
Firstly detect your missing topics and plan day, place the topic on each day and make them necessarily care.
This planning will relieve you both academic and psychologically.
Pay attention to the issues that you make the most mistakes when placing the topics into your plan.
Because you will not have a long-term holiday period in advance.
Q Solutions Structure:
It is very important to solve the question until the topic is repeated.
Because we can see how much we understand and what we get through the question we have solved.
Remember to put a number of questions to each day.
The number of questions you want may vary according to the work you do on that day; the subject may not solve a lot of questions on a day you work mainly, but we should still work in a certain amount of questions in terms of seeing how much we learn about this day.
Trial Exams Word:
Another study to do in the semi-year holiday should also solve trial tests.
Although all of the topics have not been over, you can do at least the course test solutions.
Let’s say; you’ve taken great care of Turkish lessons; you can solve the trials of the Turkish lesson prepared in 40ar questions.
And do not work for time while doing it.
If you are able to solve 40 Turkish questions in the first 60 minutes, then you get to solve your next goal as soon as possible.
Holiday And Leisure Plan:
The holiday is subject to the course not only to work; you should also take a few days for your holiday, rest and hobbies.
Only a holiday period to be spent with the study of the lesson will prevent you from discharge and rest.
That’s why you should also have special times that you will separate yourself in your plans.
Reading books, watching TV, surfing on the Internet can be within your plans, most importantly, how much time you will take.
I would have a little advice to friends who say I couldn’t have the first time productive.
If my first period was not too good, I couldn’t work very much and I’m saying I don’t have too much, this half-year holiday is also great opportunity for you.
But you must first decide and believe it.
Goals in the Turkish football super league in 2009-2010 season were scored between 76. and 90 minutes.
Now you answer the question you ask for, the match is over and you are going to the locker room, or the match continues and there are a lot of minutes you will score in a row?
I don’t want to say "we will look at the next matches" which is a classic comment that is used by a football team teacher or players.
The only thing you’ll do now should stop and look at your front, not run.
If we are going to make what we say:
1) Firstly plan a half-year holiday,
2) Repeat passing through the topics you know,
3) Treat your missing topics,
4) Do issues consolidation by solving the question,
5) Solve trial exams,
6) Read book,
7) Set new goals for the new period,
8) Take time to yourself, hobbies and things you enjoy,
9) Take time to your family and friends,
10) Take time to social and cultural activities (ma, sports, theatre, concert, sightseeing, picnic etc.)

When preparing the key list of Kılıçdaroğlu for 100 people, Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş said that he will be listed in the list by calling 13 MYK members outside Seyhan Erdoğdu, who was nominated once more to PM with Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş.

Until now 34 usual, CHP, who collects 52 committees, 53th largest committee yesterday in Ankara Arena.
Participation was high.
There were more than 15 thousand CHP in 12 thousand seats.
However, there was no enthusiasm to the crowd.
The most exciting moment was the moment that Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued to greet the double hall of Kılıçdaroğlu.
There was no discipline seen in the AK Party Boards in the Salon.
Sworddaroğlu had a great mobility in the field of the Arena even talking about.
Obviously, CHP, who wanted to enter the Party Assembly, prefers to seek support by telling themselves to party managers and journalists.
A CHP manager tried to tell you that this situation is not something bad with words "It's good from a series of and inactivity, such as stringing party meetings in the "Korea or Soviet Union."
There is a difference from the CHP board, the EC Party or MHP board.
Only general presidents talk about these parties.
In CHP, the committee turns into a platform where party problems are also discussed.
Since the number of parties who want to talk in the Board, Divan President Murat Karayalçın had trouble setting the time.
There was also a distance against the reviews of "It is going badly" in the faces and languages. "You will change the departure with the table that will come from this salon.
All CHPs had a consistent and strong response to the question of "What to do" if "One thing to do".
In this case, there was no choice in the next 4 years.
When the Kılıçdaroğlu was cured, we waited to respond to the question "What to do" in journalists.
Kılıçdaroğlu answered the question "What happens" first.
In the matter of arrested journalists, due to the statement, academicians have taken into account that they have experienced in the Southeastern, the outside policy has entered.
The "unless party" about CHP has long responded to the "Anadote legends" about the party, such as "the party of craftsmen".
As for the "What to do" stage, he tried to reveal "strateji" instead of mentioning concrete steps.
It stressed that all these problems can come with more justice with stronger democracy.
He also gave a promise on behalf of CHP and we will try no matter what the price until you bring the "Democracy.  "
"We will fight for death for democracy."
The last note is that CHP’s 53rd board was taken into account the issue of "organization" and it is necessary to remind you that it can now expect to gather smoothly.
By the way, the card was printed for 900 journalists, said they will follow the board, but the participation of journalists in the salon was not at that level.

And this third proxy may be X factor in a close decision until the U.S. economy has been announced on Thursday since the end of 2008, and whether the unique stimulant support from a short-term interest rate is ready to be interrupted.
While most data shows that the economy is growing in a solid way, the state of the global financial markets is ready to make careful Fed officers, reference federal fund interests - even less than a quarter of one percent - increasing the fragility.

"But I think that if they are looking for a mazeret to increase the rate, the global market will give them enough grounds to wait a bit more of the growing uncertainty surrounding.

Only a month ago, the Fed seemed that the rate of this month was 0,25% in the way to increase points, which would be a small step, which strengthens the recovery of the US, in the way of the slow contraction of money conditions.

Weight loss surgery can help patients with moderate obese
According to a new study, the benefit of obesity surgery can last up to five years in mid-grade obese patients with type 2 diabetes.
However, the patients with moderate obese have not experienced surgery after obesity surgery, yet early to say that they live longer than they were suffering.
Dr. Dr. Dr., who wrote articles in new study conducted on JAMA surgery and specializes in obesity surgery According to Robin Blackstone, it takes a long time to determine the "division rates".  "
Weight loss surgeries use a variety of methods to shrink the diameter of the stomach with other name bariatric surgery.
These reduce hunger and restrict the ability of food digestion of the body.
Over the years, the type of bariatric surgery was proved to be effective in the treatment of 2 diabetes, but most of the research were done on advanced obese people, which are 35 or above.
The BMI, which is measured through the height of weight, is considered normal from 18,5 to 24,9.
25 or above BMI shows that the person is overweight, 30 more BMI ones are considered obese.
You can calculate the BMI from: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new research, the full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital in Taiwan has been using two kinds of bariatric surgery applied in the treatment of medium-grade obese patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007 - gastric bypass and tube stomach surgery - data obtained from the experiment they compare.
From the end of the fifth year of the research, the average BMI of the surgical ones returned from 31 to 24,5.
It is possible that the BMIs of those who have undergone surgical-non-diabetic diabetes have remained constant in 29 walls.
Diabetes has been partially resolved in 36% of surgical ones.
In the group treated from medical roads, diabetes has only been completely in 1% and only partially resolved in 2%.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and "bad" LDL cholesterol were generally better in the "cerrahi interfered group" group.
The researchers also viewed blood levels of A1c hemoglobin that reflects blood sugar rate in time in patients.
It is best to keep A1c hemoglobin under 7% according to the researchers write.
After surgery, A1c hemoglobin averaged about 6 percent from 9 percent.
The medical treatment group remained around 8 percent.
But straightened A1c hemoglobin levels with this better "glymic control", researching Dr. According to Chih-Cheng Hsu and teammates, it has not reduced mortality rate in five years.
The findings of the research team were compared with these two types of operations.
In the fifth year, the group with nasal bypass surgery to the group with tube stomach surgery has given much weight (18,7 to 14,2 kg), in BMI (7,4 to 5,1) and in the same way A1c hemoglobin (3.2% to 1.1%,1) higher declines were seen and the probability of restoring diabetes is higher (46,9 to 16.7).
The research also states a clear benefit from postoperative life at the end of the fifth year, from Arizona Medical College-Phoenix Dr. Blackstone said it is the current data that it extends the life time of the surgery according to a study conducted in more weighted patients in Sweden.
In this study of Swedish, the likelihood of death in 15 years of obese patients who have been hospitalized in the bariatric surgery was 29 percent lower than another group.
Although this new study did not show what benefits for patients with surgery have survived, but it is relevant to the topic according to Blackstone and this condition is trusted for people under BMI 35.
The most annoying part of the article is that, because in the lower group of BMI, this is said that the surgery is safe, any increase in death risk or renal disorders is unprecedented.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking weight seriously with the BMI drop below 27 to 30.
I thought that people would have enough to take this matter seriously, said.
I think it’s really difficult to reverse it after collecting these genetic changes in the leges that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.

A woman who is focused on the edge of the window, jump down.
Who is and why suicide has been taken and understood by interfering side neighbors.
A MEKTUP
'Ebru Uysal', a popular writer, where the sea is revived.
It is not the only reason that the husband has been abandoned by.
In there are things that are accumulated since childhood.
He thought that he did not tolerate father love, exclusion in student life, only passing childhood, wrong relations, not understood; brought him to this point.
I decided to suicide a letter in the Ard, but it cannot skip from the glass.
Because the deer and pure cleansing of the side circle 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde) sitting in the apartment against the mysterious woman 'Perran' (Sebnem Sönmez), holding her spfa.
As normal, usual processed, they approach.
Women can’t rest and concentrate.

The ‘Meltem’ that comes with its own unique and friendly style, can’t take itself to say songs when you see the crowd below.

HOME
Ender, which has been rejid for the first time, has managed to provide the pace and fluency of the game.
The comedy load of the game draws from Silk Turk with Zeynep Kankonde.
The cartoonized types that are depicted by the duo; the need mimics succeed to smile the audience with their replications.
While Şebnem transfers years’ experience very well, Deniz Çakır also exhibits a persuasive performance that reflects the depressive mood of ‘Ebru Uysal’.
Tolga Çelik’s award-winning film is accompanied by Kadir Çermik, who talked about the performance of ‘Sarmaşık’.
The single curtain game, described as the bunoon comedian, is vowed from the head mixing.
Most often the ‘Perran’s mouth played by Şebnem Sönmez, those who remain in my mind from those beautiful laf, as follows: They are reading writing a colleague; they are seeing, having to play.
All children thought to die once to punish their mother and fathers, and at the end of thinking that they are always crying.
The woman hanging in the air like an uncomprehensible joke.
Women always look for a funny story of forgetting the most important place.
In fact, every story begins with a kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to hang my hands on my pocket; I can’t stand for things without pocket.
It is surprised where human hands are put.
Our hands multiply.
People who speak from behind that they aren’t understood, satellites.
A misunderstanding becomes true.
The head of all women is mixed because it is mixed.
There is a chance to live according to what you can’t feed.

Why is a Treaty in Oklahoma
I'm going to watch a man's kill because of a legal intervention late in the following hours.
I will not hope, but if, I will sit when Richard Glossip is executed with deadly injection at the Prison of Oklahoma State.
I asked myself to be one of the four official witnesses of my death.
The invitation was first made in January through the best friend and I accepted, although I am shocked.
I started to be afraid of it, as it is close to the day.
Why do I do it?
I accepted because I thought it was a good way to tell all the story about a death fine.
We will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to monitor the executions in America, and because there is much more practice than the available places, a horrible lottery appears when deciding who to choose.
Oklahoma reduces media seats from 12 to five.
Who will watch her feelings without being chosen.
I cannot do it.
I’m going to sit next to the closest friends of Richard Glossip and developed a relationship with him as a result of phone calls and a visit for two and a half an hour.
I love that guy.
We smile very often while talking.
The authorities in the prison tell me that I could not be both witnesses and journalists, so I will not be given pens and books to save what I have seen.
We try to remember all the details.
Oklahoma journalist accused me from my neutrality through Twitter.
Here's course.
Tell the story of Mahkumun as he likes, gain access.
I asked him.
He also acknowledged that "can bring the word better" but he thinks that what I do is wrong.
Richard Glossip is not the same idea in some things I said and write.
I didn’t tell me what I’m going to write and I didn’t accept it.
I told him that when I could take me from the list of witnesses.
But an international correspondent also wants to write them.
Deadrse thinks that this will help the anti-risk movement of the public spread.
A correspondent from Huffington Post, who will also be in my side.
If you want to learn more about it, please listen to the podcast series I have prepared.
I will not tell all the details here.
I have no exact idea of Richard Glossip is innocent.
Barry Van Treese is enough to make himself a criminal partner after death.
But I still believe that it is not guilty for murder.
I believe that there is no enough evidence that a death penalty will be legitimate.
I think that his procedure is wrong.
And I’m going to watch his death with this perspective.
I can’t really claim I’m going to be objective.
For this, you can view other correspondents there.
The impressions you get from me will be the impressions that you will get from watching the death of a man who loves to kill unnecessaryly.

Earlier, Moody had exploded a bomb that accuses his/herity department in the interview of a racing.com.
"We were sitting in a room with a man of Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart before the month - I called if asked - and in return to tell them what I did in my barns, they were offered to give him a job in my barns" said Moody, at Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I have a threesome.
If the situation is that they all need to return their bred, because they were not capable to catch me.
The former president of RVL Robert Roulston, the new president of RVL David Moodie and RVL’s current director of this time they know.
Did you think that this starts to be personal?
RVL has a number of balls, and perhaps want to make anyone outside the runers responsible for what is happening in the industry?
I am bad for industry?
I am so bad for industry?
Maybe people out think I’m so.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I don’t have any doubts as I thought about them.
But at the point where I came, I can’t get anything, and that’s going to me.
This really goes away.
I’m going to print on them, I’m going to load the responsibility to decide them.
I have the support of my family and I'm walking.
The cobalt investigation that has been involved in the Lydian of the runer for a long time and the frustration that he lived due to the next scratching event would say that "Take the opposite tip of the table".
The unfamiliar champion revealed the rule of maintaining the Moody race day with preparing the Kara Havyar as "edit", the mud or clay was contrary to the rules of removing the horse feet of the lap.
This is contrary to race rules.
I must assume all responsibility for this.
One of my guys took the mud accidentally on his foot.
He could take night yesterday.
Yesterday he could take, which was.
took the race day.
Moody may face three months of punishment due to using lapa in race day care as a result of the investigation that managers are hungry.
This is a joke.
These rules do not know anything about horses.
"We understand that we need rules but this work went very forward" said Moody.

Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attributed his own team as the effort of targeting criticism NRL for two favorite tops.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson Friday night in the semifinals in Sydney, said they allowed the arbitrators to "making" with their team.
The Saturday night of the Brisbane Broncos trainer Wayne Bennett team was characterized as a match of the half-final match he earned against the North Queensland Cowboys, by sending Storm a lot of unclosed submissions, he described the match as a match for the ragbi League and said that two Oueensland is not "very big" in wrestling.
Bellamy defended the struggle of the team and said they were focused only on "temas" while fighting.
Bellamy said that Storm has received power from two leading teachers to their team as they mean they are concerned about themselves.
This is growing – I didn’t hear that Trent Robinson mentions wrestling when they beat us 242, said Bellamy Wednesday.
I guarantee that we haven’t changed anything in our defense systems or techniques for the whole year, we just made a real emphasis on our struggling contacts in the last six weeks and this was a milestone for us.
Trent has a big team for three years there and apunition, and it is not unusual to lose with a small shock for himself.
It is also funny that the year has occurred in these times.
Bellamy has appeared against the idea of Bennett "heyecan football", Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra reminded the winner's teacher by playing the first place of Dragons.
Wayne mentions exciting football.
With their own matches on Saturday night, our Friday night has made a match to compare our match and how exciting their match was" said Bellamy.
I remember that St George was criticized as it was a boring team in 2010 and said Wayne would not even give the mouse spark.
But now there is a team that will play the football we can say exciting football and especially young halfs with speeds.
This is the football you will want to play when you have such players.
In 2010, he put this point, now everyone wants to play football in this style - every team does not have half (twoies) such as Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it does not be possible to play in this way.
This gives me more confidence because they are talking like this because they don’t even get a bit out of playing.
When they went to large matches six weeks ago they did not bring us to their minds.
Bellamy also marked that Storm and Roosters match have higher score than Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos match was a good match in allhals, I did not follow it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our match is 20 - 18, this is the more exciting football score of two sides in our match?
Or is it exciting not to hack the attack but do not do score returns?
That’s what I’m per day.
If they are talking about us, it means that we will encounter them here in an advanced phase.
Storm, one of the North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks tickets have won the right to aggravate on Saturday night in the first final match released on Tuesday.

Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere’s Dynamo Zagreb match had problems with teammates.
Wenger stressed that Wilshere is experiencing disability in September and its treatment is planned, there is no reason for playing in Christmas queues.
The best scenario already means Wilshere will miss at least four matches in the UK and is uncertain as it seems to attend and participate in the European Championship in the next summer.
The most embarrassing side of the final problem is that Wilshere has finished the last season strong after a separate ankle disability, and then throws the old sharpness before the season.
This type of disability career is not threatening, he spoke to Wenger.
This is a fully healing bone.
Not a big thing.
This was only an accident.
There is no connection with their wrists or previous disability.
According to a medical perspective, these may be true, but as wenger will also accept, there is also the danger of a player who has a return in the middle of the season.
There is also a growing disturbing mold.
According to the research conducted by Prömaria Injury Ltd, Wilshere was 23 different ailments recorded since six years ago.
In the last five season, Arsenal played only in 65 league matches.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of the two First League teams that lose most of the time due to disability since 2007-08.
Wenger accepts a jealous cycle potential but Arsenal believes that it will drive healing in the record of disability in the last season.
"You live a clear period of disability, you want to strengthen your body and gain fighting," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I don’t know the body is stabilized, I trust it and I believe it will do his career he deserved.
The Champions League struggle will be played on Saturday in front of Arsenal, which will begin against the dynamo Zagreb at night, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur matches will be played next Wednesday, Wenger teams prepare them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey did not go to Croatia that is a meaning as Mathieu Debuchy will play Arteta.
Wenger can start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Theo Walcott with Nacho Monreal.
"I am trying to protect the country and give players the feeling they need," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal’s F Group’s open favourites, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among Europe’s most attracted stadiums.
After producing the "Namağlup" campaign in the last season, the 41 matches are not eaten.
The stadium was wrapped with a earthquake in 3,2 degrees according to the Richter scale on Tuesday night.
This year 10th year in Zagreb.
Wenger Arsenal’s last season believes that the Champions League receives the necessary lesson from the defeat in Monaco and continues to be motivated with the far goal of achieving the first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is huge," says Wenger.
Arsenal has never been.
I'm very close in 2006, but I have experience from the other side to be realistic.
We are passionate but we are not dreaming.
FriendsFest: comedy program that gives us serious lessons about men dating
The absence of similar ports in programs is remarkable; especially in such a period where men need more to open, and among young men suicide rates are at the peak of 15 years.
It was the biggest reason for male deaths between 20-45 years in 2013, and three times more in men compared to women.
In order to attract attention to this problem, Sefil has announced the Anti-Life Campaign (CALM) 2015 as the Year of Man and aims to come to the culture that prevents men to seek help when they need.
There is friendship in the center of the struggle to perform this challenging task.
A research conducted between the high school student showing more than 2,000 depressive symptoms showed that if there is a high number of "healthy mode" friends of the person suffering from this trouble, the chances of recovery doubled.
In the same way, a circle of mentally healthy friends for those who are not depressive is halved mental challenges.
But of course, it is necessary to be accessible first to work for friendship.
Social media is mainly in this era where communication is; focusing on style rather than content, making it more priority to respond urgently instead of meaningful communication.
Our digital lives doubled the need to look like strong, fun and successful people; even if everything is in the head of isolation.
The concepts that artificial success psychologists say externally guided values; money, image, under the domination of social status; in pursuit of these, internal values with deeper impacts on our mental health - our inner longing with personal development and friendship - is going to spend.
As Milyarder explains a video games creator recently, the money does not buy much more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was to turn this focus down.
Characters were identified not with their work but with their personality; and they reveal it with their interactions with their friends.
Joey and Chandler’s frequent windings, the minute they watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross’s cheeks were all coming from the knowledge that they could actually contact them even if they stand back in full description of the feelings of men.
I saw that a helpful employee told me: "....depressive and suicide prone to listen to people, how little interactions between friends can make a difference.  "
Most of the men who contact us can’t talk to friends.
A feeling like "Go to the Lord" is very strong, and the idea of opening to others is also a weakness indicator.  "
One of the programs that come to mind when recommending long-term coping mechanisms Friends series.
She stressed her little moments of boyfriend.
In line with my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people in the moments they stay difficult; but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you participate in FriendsFest in Comedy Central this weekend, why do you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink?
Or, better, smile and say hello if you see one alone in Starbucks.
You cannot know how to make a difference.
Friends ends from the beginning in Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - #FriendsFest released

However, he showed that he was more master when he came to organise his friends, Ibrahimoviç, who gave him the lubeful stroke that Di Maria sent to the castle of Wiland in 52. minutes.

The ideas that Malmö would turn back to the match, and after the game, Ezequiel Lavezzi did not count in gayri nizami format, then Wiland saved the syrup in the empty position of David Luiz and did not let the score change.

Since then we played the ball in the Swedish League, which is not only the same level with it.

Fashion weeks provided the massization of the mini bag current.
In pharmacies, mini bags stand out.

There is a proposal for those who can’t fit to the mini bag but don’t even leave them.
Friends mini bags to large bags.
How?

But the curator of the exhibition Steve Lazaridas said, Bansky is not even aware of this exhibition.
There is no situation that will require permission from it.
Because the way of Bansky and Lazaridas, former friend, reserved after 12 years.
Part of the exhibited works were collected from Lazaridas, part of the collectors.
But there are issues that Bansky followers wonder.
What did Banksy think about the exhibition "The Art of Banksy" where 85 works were met?
For example, enter the exhibition with tickets (35 TL) How did they meet? What if they saw the small store created at the end of the 800-square gallery area?

The large exhibition for the small, globalized world for Banksy can be seen until April "The Art of Banksy".

The documentary "Young Pehlivans" tells the story of the six-legged school student, aimed at being the world champion in the wrestling branch, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Pehlivans, the first documentary of Turkish construction selected in this section, is one of the candidates of the Crystal Bear Award.
While growth is Dutch, aslen Edirne is a director Mete Gumrhan.
He listened to oil wrestling stories from Turkey where she came in summer holidays and followed the competitions.
"No political problems in Turkey.  "
I wanted to tell you what else is happening in Anatolia.
"For example, the wrestling from our sports is unfortunately not known." He wants to prepare a documentary project that came together with 6 directors with his thoughts.
This project remains unrestricted, but the journal news that reads on a plane opens the door of another project to Gumrhan.
'We stayed in Turkey'

The father of children does not allow shooting for documentary.
Gumrhan tells you how it has gone through this difficulty: "I thought I can do all the days.
Because support was withdrawn from the Ministry of Culture.  "
In the father interview, children were talking about a board school in Amasya.
I came to go there.
I encountered 26 children who are interested in wrestling at school when looking for two children.
We started shooting preparations a week and finished permissions.
We didn’t even have our place to stay.
"We stayed in the dormitory of the factory.  "
The biggest challenge was the language of the documentary completed in 3 weeks.
Gumrhan said that the foreign image director and the voiceman was talking about three different languages in the set he worked, "I didn't know what I will encounter when I pull.  "
"They did not know Turkish." says.
Young Pehlivans focus on the story of six children wrestler.

"What's how quickly they were used.  "
She was surprised to choose from Berlin
Mete Gumrhan, who said Young Pehlivanlar did not expect to choose Berlin Film Festival, "We had a surprise, but we were selected to Berlin.  "

Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren nose, Justin hair...
It is seen as psychological discomfort after the point where it starts to affect the life completely if it is normal to a place to work like celebrities.
 ' Celebrity worship removal', nam-i. other 'sretliye worship syndrome', becoming a very academic topic in the world, we are a new spoken topic.
It can be considered normal to run with the famous photos of the lady to the hairdressers.
But all the adolescents are filled with Irish girl hair 'Hürrem Sultan' year.
In the aesthetic operations of 2015 that we left back, ‘Beren nose’ was very news.
The situation in the facade of the brains is not different.
A while Polat Alemdar was dressed up.
Now the opposite is a wind contraction.
Justin Bieber copy is filled with holes and our rocky surroundings.
We’ve read thousands of times on the internet of the following unnecessary information we quoted: "Firstly cut the sides of your hair when you go to the barber, so cut the ear top and the surroundings towards the top of your head.  "
Only sides will be short.
After cutting, you should shape your hair with light water.
Fix your hair with the help of spray after the shape is finished.
"It is necessary to shape only when it is moist to achieve hair.  "
All this has become a very academic topic in the world, the new spoken 'Celebrity worship syndrome, nam-i. other 'sretliye worship syndrome.
Fans of celebrities are seen as love tube in us.
Artists boast and stand out with their fan numbers, what they affect them.
Luckily, the state of psychology does not see so simple.
Neither adolescents eat and drink, what they will listen to, what to decide according to celebrities what to wear.
Excessive commitment to names offered as unreachable is defined as a role-modeling mental discomfort.
The specialist psychologist Sumeyye Iron accepts that Turkey is left behind in these works.
However, the families do not miss out that they are slowly conscious: "One of the basic issues of the science of Psikology is bark with themselves, catch peace in their identity.  "
The filling of the children's room with posters was not taken very seriously, one's spark.
Now this situation is changing.
It feels that parents need to interfere with the situation.
"The sign that something goes wrong in the life of the gencin who is devoted to a passion.  "
Fans of emotional speed train
The interest in celebrities is not the danger that does not overdo.
Don’t want to be married, jealousing from his wife, iron that suggests to cut into symptoms such as opting for her clothing bird.
We are talking about famous people on the name.
To wonder them, having fun with their lives is considered as normal as a place.
But the young people who miss the ball of the kantar when the specialist psychologist is believed: "Ailede or in the environment there are no names that will represent the child at the point of beautiful behaviors.  "
Not always take good examples.
"The child also rips off the child.  "
Sumeyye Demir, when we consult them how to approach, begins to mention that the famed passion syndrome is seen in puberty more.
If adolescents are considered to be unsecured, the problem is more relaxed.
On the one hand, we are facing young people who expect support and compassion on the other hand while complaining of the limitations of their families: "We are forced to consider emotional landings.  "
New research reveals that they are forced due to changes in their brains.
"Duygusal speed train should be taken into one of the young people who have taken into the train, but they should be approached with natural, soft.  "
It is possible to change behaviors
The specialist psychologist Sumeyye Iron reminds the tasks falling to the parent to overcome the famed worship syndrome:
Know her emotional distress, make sure you are calm before entering the matter.
Never let it suppress feelings.
Specify that you respect its admiration to promote independence.
Show good examples instead of teaching, discuss it on names that will be the role model.
Try to take part in our everyday life of celebrities.
The books that describe the real world of martyrs will work together.
Convert your communication to adult format.
Note that addiction and motivation use the same ways in the brain.
Share mistakes with your child that is the opportunity for change, accept it as it is.
Get expert support for fantasies.
It is admired as well as spoiled
On the basis of the masturbation syndrome, there is another need to care and help.
Unblocked love, a call for help is actually.
But unfortunately it doesn’t seem like it.
Moreover, this problem is not so common that it is not possible to limit it with a country or continent.
Home Recai Yahyaoğlu pays attention to the fact that it is certain names that engage in television in every country.
Sendrom manifests itself with connecting to these celebrities more: "They are unusual.  "
General majority do not have their possibilities.
Those who have do not live with them.
Or they couldn’t dare from them.
"If they do not have to say, they will be able to follow with the nerve that they do not live.  "
There’s actually no difference when they’re going on or watching from the nerve.
They feed both from inside to outside.
They earn money effortlessly, they are on the agenda of the magazine.
Knowing this even increases fanship.
Another advice of the specialist psychologist Sumeyye Iron is complete at this point we ask the reality of life.
It should not be missed that artificial lives are concerned.
The support of the environment to the people who are passionate about the martyr, comes into action here.
But the person says that the fan is the famous itself, as well as the derts.

Should I have a gallbladder surgery? - Family - Health News - Time Newspaper
Home Ker Özgönül answers questions in the corner of the Square Newspaper.
I have stones in my gallbladder, and when I get up every morning, after meals, I go to the toilet 2 or more times a day with abdominal pain.
Can I prevent my weight loss?
I started to use alkalen right now but my desire to eat is not less, I can’t lose weight at all.
This is because of my childhood.
What should I do?
Do I have gallbladder surgery?
CEVAP: Most often accompanied by an infection to the sapling stone.
Immediately after the meal, these abdominal pain complaints are also a sign that you are emptying the gall bladder and empty the inflamed bile into the intestines.
The intestines that are disturbed due to the medica bile quickly try to throw out this bile.
That’s why you’re going to the toilet.
As you often get out of the toilet, your sevenths are thrown without being digested and your weight is slow.
I think you need to treat this situation.
If you go to a specialist in the Gastro enterologist and the situation I said is detected, you can get rid of this situation using antibiotic.
But at the end, you may also need to be a gallbladder surgery.
Alkalen probiotic can slightly reduce your complaints, but it's durable.
No matter what happens, I continue to use alkalen probeotics.
Because it is the most helpful probiotic powder for your slimming.
I eat very much while stressed
Hocam I give myself a meal when I have stressed and irritated and getting weight.
How can I cope with it?
CEVAP: The desire to eat excessively actually means that the need for energy is not fully met.
This is because it can be eaten less or thrown in the morning and lunch.
Another reason is that you can not digest the nutrients you eat.
For this, your digestive system needs healthy work.
If you do not have a ulcer, reflux or similar problem, you can use a best probiotic drug.
You will see the benefit more.
I do not want to lose weight, doctors do not know the cause
There are generally information for slimming in your corner.
It’s all that makes me very sense but my status is slightly different.
I can not take any weight.
Most importantly, I don’t know the reason for it.
There is nothing in doctors.
CEVAP: The techniques we apply are not only for weakening, but to return the physiological work of the body to the ideal dimensions.
The weakness with fat is the same kind of discomfort.
Weight loss in fat is treated with the same technique to lose weight in weakness.
You are also weaker when you eat sweet and doughy foods.
I'm thinking about it.
You can also be alerted with karboksipunktur and gain weight with healthy diet.
So you are away from weakening your ideal body.
Our other patients are fated from their ideal body.
You will reach your ideal body by taking weight, they will gain weight.
If the system eliminates the problem, you get weight, they also lose weight.
But firstly, the system needs to work properly.

The child's 'nefret' from self-responsible feeling
There are some feelings that are born in the world of human feeling.
Horror, sadness, happiness, surprise, angry, anxiety...
But the sensations such as hate, kin, revenge appear in children as a result of time and some false attitudes.
Every person needs to be an individual, including childhood.
So you respect the decisions of the parent or social surroundings, you want to ask the idea of the matters that concern him and feel valuable.
The provision of them is the basis of a healthy personality.
For example, decision-making of the child in matters interested in the child (what to wear, what to eat), it means that the child can not care about his wishes and to say their right instead (to be sent to the instrument course of the child who wants to go to the course of the war).
The defense mechanism reveals the sense of anger and hate to protect him, as the child who does not respect for his existence and presence.
"because it is actually the opposite of the adoption of anger and hate." The psychologist Hilal Arslan says that the child did not agree to him by hating him, he tries to tell him and her surroundings that he is precious.
The specialist psychologist, who states that the child is a positive development in terms of his personality development, which reacts in this way, "I also exist here" means the purpose of protecting the respect of the child itself.  "
"If the individual of the child is appointed, the hat will disappear.
Child tries to protect its self-employment by adapting to anger and hate
At a small age, the parents of children at the most vulnerable times of both bodily and soul, said that the exposure of verbal and emotional violence can lead to negative emotions in the child, Arslan states that the presence of the child with negligence will not be noticed, feeling that it is invisible.
The words of Arslan continue as follows: "This can sometimes not only meet the needs of emotionally emotionally (not to care about the temperament, yellowing, kissing, school or other needs), sometimes it can be in the form of not being met (such as fire, drinking, shelter, school needs, etc.).  "
This is a growing attitude that opens the door to the hate.
In case of emotional and verbal violence, insult, insult, minority, insult, unnecessary and severe penalties, feeling in valuelessness, such as shouting.
These behaviors touch a deep place as directed to the child’s personality.
"The child loses its respect by accepting them and tries to protect his self-esteem, without self-responsible, not worthy of love, and with the feeling that it is insufficient, or to fit anger and hate.  "
