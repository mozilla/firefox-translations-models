The professor confessed to killing his girlfriend by calling 911.
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and that the police were supposed to come home, only a little shaky.
Lamb said that his "lovely dog" was alive and possibly sad, and that the parents of the dead woman's family's phone could be found on her cell phone.
Police found Amy Prentiss' lifeless body in the house and a note handwritten in a white notebook: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could turn everything around, I loved Amy very much, and she was the only woman who ever loved me," the officers said.
Two online lecturers at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, there was no indication that Lamb had already traveled 300 miles to the school campus, where police-like history professor Ethan Smidt was shot and killed in front of his office by Lamb.
Lynn Buford, chief of police at Delta State University, said the university officials heard the shooting at 10:18 p.m.
He also stated that Lamb made the desperate 911 call shortly after that.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
The day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind locked doors, authorities were still investigating what drove Lamb to do so.
In addition to investigators on both sides of the state, the details of the students and staff who knew him have been drawn by a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
The students said they were looking forward to taking his class.
A cop in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal record or criminal record.
In fact, Schmidt mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote as one of the great people he shared his academic life with.
Both taught at the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students learned from both.
However, there were signs of mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who praised Lamb, said he was also a nervous, nervous person and seemed to have a "problem."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him that he was suffering from stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for sick leave, stating that he had some health problems.
He was only teaching two online lessons this year.
The recent changes in the university's employment policies could not guarantee that Lamb would automatically become a member of staff despite the degree he worked so hard to win.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "It's obvious that Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions Lamb can't answer anymore.
After the campus was evacuated, police tracked Lamb's trip from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Forensic Investigative Director Methhel Johnson explained that his family committed suicide in the backyard of a house about a mile from his home in Greenville, Mississippi, before he was arrested, with a.38-caliber weapon.
Lamb's car was found running on the highway.
Although the reason Lamb went to this house was not immediately determined, Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at the 3,500 students' university in the city of about 12,000 people and taught geography and education in 2009.
He got his PhD in education in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15, and Lamb was 20 when they met through her mutual friends.
Carla and her friends were in high school, and Lamb was an older guy who tried to teach him how to play guitar for a few years.
Back then, he was a quick heart attacker.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in the Jackson suburbs of Brandon, said to Lamb, "All the girls would melt when he came."
Lamb and Prentiss were obviously together for some time.
On the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there's no official record of them getting married.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the banks of a river in Gautier.
The police said the dog is in good condition.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago, but he and Prentiss were always friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also stated that his daughter was completely devastated.
He and his mother were great friends.
He said he'd never met O'Steen Lamb, but he heard his daughter Abigail tell him that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail performed at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail played it together in the general demonstrations.
O'Steen stated that he wrote and sang his daughter's music.
Prentiss was a nurse in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender at The Julep Room, a dim bar near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss last saw Lamb on the night of September 5th, after he finished playing guitar and harmonica for a few viewers.
There was no sign of trouble.
He said they were a pretty happy couple.
Sometimes we'd cut and throw a line at each other.
They both had a great sense of humor.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, said that Professor Schmidt, who was killed, directed the seminar program for first-years and was an expert in Native American and colonial history.
She was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas City and was the president of a student support group he founded.
On Tuesday night at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland, about 900 people attended the candle sewing ceremony, including academics, university workers, students and visitors from the local community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and her brother Jeff Schmidt attended the memorial ceremony, where the college choir sang "Glitter Morning Star" and "Great Grace."
Classes continue on Wednesday.
"We are trying to bring back our students," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to heal the wounds.

Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (in Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (in New Orleans) contributed.
This article was edited in a way that would reflect the fact that Lamb called 911 after he killed Schmidt and that there was no official evidence that the two were married, even though Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife on the 911 call.
Toys R Us Plans to Get Less Holiday Season Guy
Toys R Us announced he would not hire as many holiday season employees as last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said it would give the current employees and seasonal workers more opportunities to work.
The company said it plans to employ 40,000 people at department stores and distribution centres across the country, which was 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be part-time.
Interviews with candidates will begin within the month, and staff numbers will increase from October to December, the company said.
Although the holiday season is still months away, the holiday shopping season is coming up, and companies are preparing to employ temporary workers who will help them with their stores and sell, send, and distribute.
Michael J. Fox Made Jokes About Princess Diana's Relationship
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
And it was important for personal reasons.
" We were sitting in the theater waiting for members of the Royal Family to arrive, and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty, and I knew Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The movie started, and I realized that dating the Princess of Wales was a fake stretch and a stretch away from me.
It includes interviews with Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Returning to the Future was first seen 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "This is the most exciting time travel movie ever made for me."
Back in Time VOD and DVD formats will also be shown in some distinguished cinemas.
UN Chief Says There Is No Military Solution in Syria
About Russia's growing military support for Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Syrian problem that has been going on for nearly five years could not be solved "by military intervention" and that more weapons would only be more violent and painful for millions of people.
The UN Secretary-General also urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to meet and hold constructive talks in an effort to find a political solution to the problem.
Ban said he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the United States, China, Russia, Britain and France at the meeting of the UN General Assembly, which will be held at the end of the month.
The division between the council members and the Syrian people is deeply upset that regional forces have made the problem "unresolved."
Ban invited five permanent members to join forces in the Syrian crisis as well as in the Iranian nuclear agreement.
8 Polls Showing Donald Trump Serious
Some of them tried to label it tanning.
The others made it look like a joke to him.
And some of them are supporting the internal explosion.
Some Republicans tried to pull Donald Trump down in the polls, but that didn't work yet.
The latest 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's leadership in double digits, and some of them are seriously asking for the real estate emperor's chance to run.
Of course, it's early in the election cycle.
None of this means Trump can win the Republican nomination.
Experts say that Rick Perry's rise in 2011 led to a rise for Herman Cain, neither of whom won the nomination process in a single state.
And there's a lot of reasons he's gonna have trouble with the general election.
But outside groups, such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC group and the economic conservative group Growth Club, recognize Trump's permanent power and start spending dollars to bring him down.
Here are some recent polls showing that the real estate emperor is not only temporary:
Trump's preference rate has changed 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a survey at Monmouth University showed that two out of 10 Republicans had positive views for the real estate emperor.
In the middle of July, it was 40 percent.
In early August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
Roughly three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these numbers are high in early stages.
Last week, a survey in Quinnipiac, Iowa showed that 60 percent of the Republicans there preferred Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters may be pleased with the Trump nomination.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said that if Trump was nominated, they would be "exciting" or "supply."
Only two out of 10 people said they'd be "sorry" if he ran.
It's the same level of enthusiasm as Ben Carson Trump.
The person closest to enthusiasm?
Only 21 percent compared to Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 per cent of Republican voters say that if Jeb Bush, the institution's favorite candidate, they will not be "happy" or "sorry."
The majority of Republicans don't see Trump's temperament as a problem.
Donald Trump has been criticised for his flashy language and insults, while 52 per cent of Republicans asked by ABC News/ Washington Post polls believe that the real estate emperor has the right temperament to become president.
The same is true in Iowa, where the country's first party board will be held, and according to Quinnipac here last week, 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality to be the leader.
He still thinks he has 44 per cent of the personality to serve effectively, and according to ABC/Post, six out of 10 independents say that his temperament does not suit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their political expert hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of 10 people said Trump was the best candidate to win the GOP nomination.
A change from the end of July, when four out of 10 put their money into Jeb Bush.
Full disclosure: In the past, the GOP voters' crystal ball was not clear.
During the last election cycle, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would run, and only 28 per cent chose Mitt Romney, who was finally running.
The majority of GOP voters still seem to find Trump's campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans gather around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts suggest that the disorganized area could also contribute to Trump's progress, and it is true that the anti- Trump support has been distributed among more than a dozen candidates.
However, a Monmouth University poll conducted in early September shows that Trump and many Republican candidates have received the support of the majority at every turn.
Carly beats Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points, and finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
It's a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who can beat him?
In case there's a possible head-to-head situation, Ben Carson points the businessman 19 points.
The majority of Donald Trump's supporters say they've made their decision.
A new CBS/NYT survey, published on Tuesday, shows that more than half of the voters who support Trump say they have locked their votes.
Frankly, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can say that they really won't change their mind.
He said they left the door open to replace 46 percent candidates.
Still Trump's biggest rival is neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but the voters who say they've made their decision are twice as close to voting for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "the rapist" in his campaign ad two months ago, the issue at the beginning and centre of the 2016 talks has been immigration.
Some think Trump's much-spoken speech is driving important Hispanic voters away from the Republican Party and damaging their rebranding efforts.
However, six out of 10 Republicans agree with Trump on immigration issues, according to the new ABC/Post survey Monday.
So, as long as immigration stays on the agenda, Trump seems to stay on the agenda.
Anger in the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are roughly taking half the Republican vote because of their largely external situation.
Six out of every 10 Republicans in the new ABC/Post survey on Monday say they want an outsider instead of someone with government experience.
And they're mad at Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry at Republicans in Congress, 44% were "unpleasant" and 21 percent were "excessively angry."
Jeremy Corbyn will take the stand for the first time in the Prime Minister's Questions
Since the day he was elected, Mr. Corbyn was eagerly expected to take the stand in the Prime Minister's Questions Program.
Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the new Labour Party, will take the stand in the Prime Minister's Questions after David Cameron for the first time.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly after noon, and his performance will appear to be studied closely by the media and Labour Party MPs.
He called "less theatre and more real" for a weekly show.
He also said he could skip some sessions by leaving them to his colleagues.
This match will be the first parliamentary test of Mr. Corbyn's leadership, his appointment of the shadow cabinet and his speech at the TUC annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour Party leader's silence during the reading of the national anthem during Tuesday's tribute to the 75th anniversary of the British War has been criticised by some Tory MPs and is the focus of the front page news.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to accompany the national anthem drew attention
Speaking on behalf of Mr. Corbyn, a spokesman said he stood in "respectful silence" and appreciated the heroicness of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England.
However, Owen Smith, a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet, told the BBC Two's News Night program that he would recommend the Labour Party leader to sing the national anthem as "independent" for his belief in the removal of the monarchy.
About a dozen shadows, due to differences in economic, defence and foreign relations, refused to serve on Mr. Corbyn's top team, while less than one sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
According to BBC political correspondent Robin Brant, policy differences within the Labour Party have also begun to "swallow" and are issues of Mr. Corbyn's appointment over the position in the European Union and the government implementing the upper limit for assistance.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference, the Labour Party has presented new changes to lift the upper limit completely.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the minister of shadow work and pension, said the party was opposed to the government lowering £23,000, which is just £26,000, and it was "very clear."
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour Party leader he will meet on the bench in the common quarters from the time David Cameron became the leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader pledged a different approach to politics and said he received more than 30,000 "people-based" and advice to ask Mr Cameron.
Islington North MP told the Prime Minister that the Questioning Program is very defiant and would focus on poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people rather than exchange sarcasm with "responsibility."
Mr. Corbyn said that when Mr. Cameron, for example, went abroad to travel, he would represent Angela Eagle, the Shadow Trade Minister in the Questions Program.
He even suggested that his other colleagues would take the stand from time to time, and he also told Common House Speaker John Bercow that he had applied to discuss the matter.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said that he wanted to get away from the "Puppet Game" type of politics that was often associated with the Prime Minister's Questions Program, but he admitted that he had failed to do so a few years later.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questioning Program has been used as a basic measurement point to measure the leadership's decision-making capabilities, their sovereignty in the House of Commons and their positions among the MPs, and some critics have voiced that it has been caricatured and that it needs extensive reforms.
'It's taken in Joburg': Homeless teenagers study photography
downtown Johannesburg is a tough place for homeless people.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to acquire a new talent and make a living.
I was shot in Joburg, a non-profit studio where homeless kids take pictures of their neighborhoods and teach them how to make a profit out of it.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise with the increase in wages in the United Kingdom
Following data showing increased wages in the United Kingdom, the FTSE 100 index rose after the offer to buy for SABMiller.
Excluding the bonus in the United Kingdom, prices rose by 2.9% between May and July, compared to the same period of the previous year.
The rate, which has expressed the fastest growth since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest increases.
Sterling gained more than 1 per cent against US dollars, raising to $1.505 per cent against euro, and to €1.3730 against euros.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6.229.21 points with an increase of 1.49 per cent.
The most prominent company on this rise was SABMiller, who rose 20% with an attractive bid from his rival, EU InBev.
This offer will unite two of the world's largest beer companies, and famous brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry stocks have increased by 0.9%, due to positive profit reports from the rival luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont's current sales figures have also shown that sales in China -- one of the key markets for Burberry -- have increased again.
Mining giant Glencore's shares rose 5% after he announced that he had acquired $2.5 billion from the company's allocation of allocations as part of the company's strategy to reduce its debt.
The stocks of the wrapping and paper group Mondi were among the highest-valued shares after Goldman Sachs dropped his proposal for the company to "Sat."
JD Sports' share rose by 3.1% after announcing the company's six-month pre-tax profits increased by 83% to 46.6 million pounds.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries can damage expansion
JD Sports Executive Board President Peter Cowgill said that the minimum wage for workers in England could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But he said that this spending power wouldn't go above the expense of a high-employee in his own company.
He added that expenses would affect JD Sports' expansion plans, which could mean less work.
Metcash launches a public campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and Western Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesaler Metcash launched a public campaign to defend retail stores in South Australia and West Australia against a $700m Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centers in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year and one of the first stores to reach 120, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets strengthen their relations with local food suppliers and try to create the IGA brand with mainstream and social media marketing and activities such as Adelaide's fair.
IGA pimps and suppliers also contribute to brands such as the Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo, who offers a taste test at IGA stores, and to their loyal customers, store owners who have discounted tickets to the South Australian Football League.
Metcash, a food, alcohol and equipment wholesaler, is expected to present more details about the defence strategy as his annual investment strategy improves on September 29th.
The risk is great, because South Australia and West Australia represent almost 30% of the Metcash's IGA store footprint and produces more profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
The store owners of South Australia and West Australia are negatively narrow-minded and enjoy a much stronger market share than the IGA retailers in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% more in the GA and 24 percent in the BA than in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will take over about 5% of the market market market within 12 months after opening his first stores in these two states, taking the sales from current players, but in general, non-profit retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted that IGA retailers would lose $360 million in one year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This estimate is based on Aldi's estimate that next year he will open 25 stores in the GA and 30 stores in the BA and will get $500 million and $600 million in sales in each market.
Mr. Kierath said the loss of food and market sales and the Metcase's high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash about $13m in interest and pre-tax.
Metcash is also losing market share in eastern states, first Aldi and Coles, despite recent Roy Morgan research, which shows that IGA clients are the most loyal customers.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash's food and market sales will decrease by 4.8% in 2016, 4.1% in 2017 and 2.1% in 2018, which will reduce market share from 14% in 2015 to 10.3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, founder of the Magellan Financial Group, the leading fund manager, said that Metcash could "possibly be erased in ten years" at a business dinner in Melbourne.
Metcash refused to give an answer to Mr. Douglass' comments.
However, it appears that a Metcash board member contacted Mr Douglass last week.
The market share of the IGA has dropped from 18% to 14% since 2010, and Metcash's earnings from the food and market business, which has provided supplies to about 1200 IGA retailers, have dropped 43% since 2012, as sales and margins have been under pressure, as business leverage decreases.
However, the wholesaler resists, invests more than 150 million dollars a year in Coles and Woolworths for shelf prices that match each week, helping IGA retailers to renovate their stores, adding faster-growing fresh foods, and opening a better custom-labeled grocery line to the public.
Ian Morrice, the head of the Metcash executive board, says the price matching and store renovation programmes are beginning to yield results, and the wholesaler is expected to return to basic snow growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Steve Healy, president of Tennis Australia.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism for his behavior.
According to Steve Healy, president of Tennis Australia, Thanasi Kokkinakis, his friend Nick Kyrgios was the one who was accidentally damaged in the last storm around him, and he deserves more credit than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of what is normally referred to as "Special K's," found Kyrgios at the Montreal Masters under the spotlight that did not welcome himself because Stan Wawrinka was publicly crushed.
"Wawrinka came after Kyrgios, and I have to go after that boy."
Kokkinakis, who was last seen breaking Richard Gasquet's racket potentially upsetting him at US Open, was faithfully defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing with Sam Groth in Glasgow for the second singles position behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semifinals.
"What I feel quite enthusiastic about is that I think that Thanasi is being argued a little bit," Healy said.
He broke his racket when he was blocked and lost in the U.S., but he's not the first player to break a racket because he's disappointed in himself, and I know Thanasi is well aware that he shouldn't be proud of it.
But in fact, in the U.S., he's handled himself quite well under very provocative circumstances with Harrison and the others, and I think he deserves a lot of praise.
He's got a great team around him, a great family, and I think it's been a little too much.
Although he's 19 years old, he's very mature, he works hard, and he's adapting to the team, he has no problem with the other players, he's well respected in the dressing room, he's been practicing hard, he's a very stable, mature young man, and I think he deserves to be judged in his own criteria.
Healy also supported Kyrgios' decision to tolerate Kyrgios for a significant tie, and began to explain from Friday that what was right for everyone was to "make a mutual decision" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term anchor.
"First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the game, not on the competition around [Kyrgios]," Healy said.
And I think, as people like Nick, Federer and Murray have pointed out, the boy rose up very quickly, grew up in public and made some terrible mistakes, and he deserves all the criticism he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and sometimes when he's not under the spotlight, he thinks that my opinion is appropriate, that it's best for the team and himself.
European immigration crisis: Hungary declares emergency, closes borders and detains immigrants
On Tuesday, Hungary declared an emergency to stop the flow of immigrants, closing its southern border with Serbia and detaining anyone trying to break into the country illegally.
With hundreds of immigrants piled up in neutral territory, chaos at the border, and Serbian officials acted furiously.
Emigrants who fled from violence in their own country set up tents on the side of the road for an uncertain period between the checkpoints of the two countries.
But their anger was growing.
As a police helicopter passed above, the immigrants shouted, "Open the border!" and insulted the Hungarian riot police.
Others rejected their food and water as protests.
Serbia's Foreign Minister said it was "unacceptable" for Hungary to send immigrants back as the immigration movement from Macedonia and Greece continued.
(Serbia) He wants to be part of the solution, not the damage to the process.
Talks with Brussels and other countries will be needed in the coming days," Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
This tension at the Hungarian-Serbia border occurred just a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a joint immigration policy at a meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 immigrants attacking Greece and Italy, and they spoke with hope that by the end of next month or year, 120,000 immigrants -- including those coming from Hungary -- would be agreed to accept them to EU countries.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to hold an EU summit next week for the discussion of the continent's immigration crisis.
Hungary, however, is not hopeful that Brussels or its neighbours will take any concrete steps on the matter.
The call for an emergency in the two southern regions on Tuesday gives authorities broad authority to fight the crisis, including the need to close the roads and speed up cases related to asylum seekers.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, on the other hand, said he plans to pull barbed wire along the border with Romania to stop the flow of immigrants from moving from this country after the barbed wire his country pulled to the border with Serbia.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata has announced that even prisoners in prison have been assigned to pull barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
For the past few months, Hungary has become an important narrow passage and transit point to the European Union, and most of these immigrants have been refugees fleeing wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the immigrants who arrive are "economic immigrants" who are trying to move to Europe for a better life than innocent people who come to escape the war -- which is completely contrary to the opinions of other EU countries, including Germany.
Laws that entered into force in Hungary in the middle of the night bring harsher punishments to human traffickers, as well as making it a crime to cross or harm a barbed wire that is 4 metres (13 feet) long at the border with Serbia.
In a statement to reporters in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government declares an emergency because of the situation of mass migration."
We're very clear on one thing: it's a crime to cross the border illegally.
Although military deployment has yet to be ratified by parliament, Associated Press reporters in the region say they have seen dogs and vehicles armed with heavy weapons for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban's domestic security adviser, said authorities have arrested 45 people trying to cross the border and 15 people crossing the border.
They've broken through the barbed wire, now they're in police custody, and they're accused of committing crimes under new law.
Authorities quickly repair barbed wire.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, using a train car covered with barbed wire to close one of the crossings.
While Hungarians activated a small metal container, where people were stuffed for processing, chaos also reflected at the main border crossing near Roszke.
20 people were able to get in, but thousands were left out.
Another group of immigrants shut down the highway connecting Serbia and Hungary and said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's win over Bernie Sanders fell by half in the national election
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead two digits in the Democratic race for national candidacy, but Sen. Bernie Sanders catches up with her.
Clinton is currently in second position with Sanders at 27%, while he is currently down 47% of the Democratic vote at 58%.
Vice President Joe Biden, who has yet to announce whether he is in the presidential race, receives 15% of democratic votes.
In more than five months before the start of the main races, most Democratic voters said it was too early to decide which candidate to support.
Clinton's supporters, however, have more firm ideas about their own choices than other candidates.
Since last month's CBS News, Clinton's been losing ground between a series of demographic groups, while Sanders has some winnings.
Clinton's got a big difference between women and moderates, but that's the difference.
His support among men has been greatly reduced, and Sanders is only five points behind him.
Clinton's 50-year-old Democratic voter advantage has evaporated, and he and Sanders are now equal.
But Clinton is ahead by a huge margin for older voters.
Last month, Clinton was leading two digits in front of Sander among the liberals, but now Sanders is five points ahead of this group.
At the national level, about half of the democratic voters say they will passionately support Clinton if the party is a candidate.
A quarter will support him on certain conditions, while another 15% will only support him if he is nominated.
Six percent don't support Clinton.
Perhaps not surprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are particularly inclined to support him passionately.
The views between those who don't support Clinton now are even more complicated -- only a quarter of them can support him passionately.
48 per cent of the Democrats have expressed passionate support for Clinton, while fewer Republican candidates are talking about Donald Trump (35 per cent).
When Clinton's supporters are asked open-ended questions about why Clinton wants him to run, the first answer is that he has the right experience (16 percent), the idea that it is now time to elect a female president (13 percent) and that he is the best candidate for the job (10 per cent).
Clinton's supporters also voice their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
Compromise in problems and selection are among the criteria set.
As a VP with potential for president, 57 per cent of Democratic voters might want to see him in the race, but that's not what a third of them think.
When democratic voters are asked what the second candidate for the party is, Biden is top of the line.
More than half of Clinton's supporters, according to Sander, say Biden may have a distinct second election.
If Biden doesn't run for Democratic Candidate, Hillary Clinton gains the upper hand of Sanders; her 20 points in a race with Biden are up to 30 points in a race without Biden.
Fifty-five per cent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the most likely candidate to win the general election, but that number dropped from 78 per cent last month to this level.
From this angle, Biden is a long way behind, although second, but the percentage of those who saw him as the most eligible candidate has increased.
Once again, when asked what is the most important thing in a candidate, the Democratic voters put the issues ahead of electability.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or candidate candidate seems unacceptable to these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates perform well in some main characteristics among the primary voters of their own parties.
The majority see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable, and also with strong leadership qualities.
In terms of honesty, Clinton is strong in leadership when he's number one among the three.
According to 30% of Democratic voters, Clinton is not honest and reliable, while half of this is saying the same thing about Sanders (15 per cent) and 27 per cent have no idea.
Democrat voters also see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same direction as their own ideology.
A quarter of the Democratic voters have no idea about Sanders in all the criteria.
As the State Department continues to question its use of its personal e-mail address and server during its mandate, most Democratic voters find the explanation satisfactory and say their views on it are unimpressed.
But it's a different story in general American public.
Only a third of Americans find it satisfying when half of them are no longer satisfied with his explanations.
The public's views on this matter were divided in March shortly after the problem was taken under the lens.
Most Americans say that e-mail disputes do not affect their general opinion of Clinton, but on the other hand, their negative ideas have increased according to 36 per cent.
They're Republicans in general, and more than six out of 10 say they've broken their views on Clinton.
Although Clinton is viewed as honest and reliable by his party's constituents, the issue is still a problem in general among registered voters: only 32% see him as honest and reliable, while this number has dropped eight points since last month, and 15 points since May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters don't find him honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters across the country do not find Trump honest and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump are getting good marks on leadership.
Of the six candidates who took the test, Biden, Carson and Bush scored best on honesty.
More than that, they find Sanders honest most of the time, but like Carson, most of them don't have an opinion about him.
The margin for error in samples taken from 351 Democrat voters is 6%.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in the national polls.
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times poll, Ben Carson runs close to Donald Trump.
The new poll shows that about half of the two candidates qualify for the vote, and that the other candidates don't have much of a chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, and your support for last CBS poll, which was 23% before last month's debate on Fox News, is climbing to 27% in Tuesday's poll.
However, Carson's support rose from 6% to 23% during the same period.
The survey also found that Carson was doing well in demographic groups, and that support among Republican voters with a college degree was much higher than Trump.
The rest are now down to 2% from last month's 10% support with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, except Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
This latest poll was conducted with 376 people elected by Republican voters, with a margin of error of 6%, and the poll was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey last week showed Carson's support among the Republicans at 19%, just behind Trump's 32% support.
The latest poll by ABC News/Washington Post showed Trump seriously ahead of Carson.
Faced with Carson's rise last week, Trump apologized for questioning Carson Trump's faith, but continued to wave randomly at the retired neurosurgeon.
Trump at a campaign stop in Iowa said last Saturday that we need energy.
Five fraternity members, Baruch College, are charged with the death of a freshman.
In the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, almost two years after the death of a college student, a murder trial was filed against five people.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi fraternity attacked Chun "Michael" Deng at a start-up ceremony in September 2013 and contributed to his death by postponing him to the hospital, according to police.
Authorities reported that he was blindfolded, caught on the back of a backpack full of 30 pounds of sand, and constantly tripped as he tried to walk towards the target in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that his head hurt over time and then he lost consciousness.
The members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood didn't call 911 after Deng passed out, and according to the police, they waited an hour before taking him to the hospital.
However, according to Police Commissioner Chris Wagner at the press conference, they changed Deng's clothes, Googled his symptoms, and asked for advice by contacting the national president of the brotherhood, Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner said at this point, members began to store personal items and put the brotherhood's best interests ahead of Michael Deng.
He couldn't be revived and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered blunt force trauma from blunt force trauma to the head, torso, and thigh.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement, many families have been destroyed as a result of the Brotherhood initiations, losing their lives every year since 1970 at least one student's initiations.
The brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step taken by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County grand jury has recommended that the first five members be prosecuted for murder in the third degree.
Thirty-two fraternity members, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with assaultal initiation and criminal conspiracy.
Wagner said at a press conference Tuesday, we will hold them responsible, not only for those involved, but if there is an organisation that officially or unofficially confirms it.
Baruch College banned the brotherhood, and the national brotherhood ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates?
With interest rates rising, the bull market is upside down, the bond revenues rise, and the economy registers recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long this is going to take.
History, especially in the economy, offers very little information about timing.
Regression has taken as long as 86 months, as it did in 11 months or so, after the initial interest rate increase.
The U.S. Central Bank Fed's aggressiveness in increasing interest rates has often been decisive in the reaction of economic and financial assets, although not continuous.
That's why US central bank officials strongly stress that investors should focus on how long the normalisation process will take, not when interest is being increased.
It's a fact that there are various variables.
As a result, however, market participants may feel that the rush to increase interest may have been exaggerated.
"It is inevitable that the first interest increase of the Fed since the global financial crisis should be interpreted by some as the end of the 'poor money' period," Julian Jessop, a global economics global economist, told customers.
On the contrary, we don't expect U.S. interest rates to slowly return to normal, but it appears to be the seismic impact most of the levels that are still low are afraid of.
Can't say it won't have any effect, though.
Based on the past trends, some areas of the economy might react as follows:
As shown in the past months in the market, waiting for interest rates to be increased may make some things unstable for a while.
As soon as the interest is increased, the effect won't be so obvious.
"It appears that the revenues of equity are trending for 12 to 24 months after the initial interest increase, which may reflect the hesitation in monetary policy," said Deutsche Bank analysts in a new study on what would happen after the Fed increases.
According to a recent analysis shared by Nuveen Property Management analyst Bob Doll at Barron's, the market has generally recorded sharp increases in the past 35 years and is moving in a straight line -- around 14 -- 250 days later -- towards the interest increase (average 2.6 per cent increase) and 500 days later, the market has returned to normal and yielded an average of 14.4 per cent in the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on the stocks has become more apparent in the next phase of the interest-enhancing cycle and the return is likely to be destroyed.
Regressions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases help them.
In the current situation, the Fed faces situations that have not existed before and will speed up the decline.
What's most remarkable is that the unofficial domestic patient is at the lowest level so far for the Fed interest increase.
According to Deutsche Bank, an increase of 118 interest rates since 1950 has only dropped to less than 4.5 per cent per cent year-on-year.
Although the second quarter of 2015 took place at 3.6 per cent, the Atlanta Fed believes that this situation is expected to be permanent by few and is observed at a third quarter per cent at 1.5 per cent.
According to Deutsche, increasing interest rates in such a delicate economic environment can be risky and could lead to the question, "Will this time be different?"
The attention of market participants who have been waiting for the Fed's interest increase for a year is this week at a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
While most strategists and economist FOMC believe that they can approve an increase in this meeting, the future trade points to only 25 per cent probability.
"We have been doing research since 1950, and all the growth cycles that have occurred so far have been in a super-enhancing trend cycle, reaching the pre-regression summits at a rapid pace after the informal domestic harvest, which has begun recovery," the report said.
On the contrary, this was a recovery of the slowest decline ever seen in an exemplary period.
The current cycle has been the longest since the last decline of the Fed -- the longest cycle on record has been 35 months, and the cycle we're in is still in the 74th month.
With interest increases expected in the market, the fixed income has become unstable, and the order is somewhat similar to those of equity.
The difference is that when you change the course of Fed policy, the effect is seen faster in bonds than in stocks.
When the first increase/fall of the cycle comes, the bond returns don't immediately change direction.
At the end of the interest increase cycle, the bond returns drop instantly," Deutsche said.
According to strategists, Charles Schwab will flatten the slope by bringing the benefits between longer and shorter bonds.
We, Kathy Jones, one of the Schwab analysts, said that high-profile bonds usually perform better in such an environment, but said "We are careful to still achieve returns."
Interestingly, Jones thinks markets are already adapting to Fed's political expectations.
"In addition to the decline in power and inflation expectations, there are various signals that the market is being organised according to a stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
Short-term interest rates are increasing, efficiency curves are correct, loan spreads have expanded and fluctuations have increased -- all the features that will be seen in the market when the Fed tightens policy.
In a broad view, companies who make most of their jobs in the United States will gain interest rates and local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies with many debts will be worse, because the increasing dollar will make products more expensive in the global market, and their debt will be even more expensive.
"History shows that stocks of 'quality' can experience low performance at the beginning of such an increase," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for their clients.
Companies with strong balance sheets averaged 5 per cent of those with poor balance sheets following the rise in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high-income and low-fashioned stocks also averaged low-quality competitors (percent) 4 (percent) with 3 averages.
The debt will become a big deal.
According to Goldman, companies with high levels of billowed courtship are most likely to suffer.
Apart from the pure stock game, consumers are expected to benefit from the rising dollar.
Although experts have differing views on how fast to hold it, austerists can also profit from high gains.
Andrew Bingham said a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accused the station of "increasing."
He argued that the radio was becoming more and more like his trade rivals.
He also accused him of targeting the BBC Music Awards and double-crossed the Brit Awards.
His deputy friend Damien Collins accused The Voice of not being original.
A leading representative pressured the publisher to show the difference between him and other commercial stations, saying BBC Radio 3 is becoming more and more "turning" to the Classic FM.
Andrew Bingham, a conservative MP, said the radio station that provides public service to BBC bosses is "increasing" and is becoming more and more different from its commercial rivals.
"I don't like to use that phrase, but Radio 3 has become the Classic FM."
In addition, the first one targeted the BBC Music Awards, which were held last December.
It's like another version of the BBC Music Awards Brit Awards that started last year.
Bingham said, "Well, if you're trying to do something different, these are the first two examples I can think of, but you keep copying what's already in the market."
The BBC general manager rejected the accusations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 was ahead of its commercial competitors in both live music and public education.
If I'm learning from Radio 3, I'm gonna go learn something else about classical music.
And that's commitment to live music, and making music is nothing compared to anything else.
I also think that the effort of Radio 3 to explore new music and promote work is very important.
At the beginning of this year, BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey claimed that the radio needed more work than the past to reach its audience, because the British were less trained in classical music.
Radio 3, however, was not the only component of the BBC that was caught because it stood in the tail of its commercial competitors at a meeting of the Committee for Culture, Media and Sports.
Congressman Tory Damien Collins also teased the Voice -- the BBC's musical talent competition, which was copyrighted by the Dutch production company Talpa Media for £22 million.
Can't you see why the program is making so much noise, because it's not original and there's no special difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was the jury of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was performed in a "bbc style."
He said he wished the agency would find a hit in his own blood before he made another entertainment show.
However, in the future, he did not agree with the idea that more audio programs would be blocked or that the amount spent on license fees would be spent on other formats.
Is Black Friday the reason that Internet sales have had the lowest increase in history in August?
The first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in internet sales.
The lowest growth has been recorded since 2000 last month, when records began to break.
There was an explosion in Internet sales three years ago when mobile devices started shopping.
Experts say November's Black Friday may be the cause of the reduction of expenditures
Online shopping has been booming for more than a decade and turning Britain's most vibrant shopping alleys into ghost towns.
After figures showing only a seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say internet sales are increasingly weakening.
The total spending amount in August was only five per cent higher than last year and has seen the lowest growth since 2000, when records began to break.
After figures showing only a seven per cent increase in internet sales in the first three months of 2015, experts say internet sales show increasingly weakening signs.
"If you look at the growth levels of previous years and especially 2000, you will actually see that everything is back to normal in time," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
Three years ago, consumers started using their mobile phones to buy products, Internet sales made a huge increase, he added.
It meant that even more people could shop while lying on the couch.
But it's going horizontal right now, so you can see the decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, an American concept, is one of the reasons why sales are slowing down.
Experts say consumers may be waiting for this event, which took place on the last Friday of November, to buy something.
At last year's event, many companies' websites collapsed when five times more consumers raided companies' websites to buy cheap products than the previous year.
The shoppers of Black Friday may have "for now," experts say, showing that shoppers are fighting over discounts.
A study published by the British Association of Retailers revealed that £1 of every £5 spent on shopping was spent online buying products.
A third of certain products, such as TV and washing machines, are now purchased from Internet stores.
In addition, over a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of luxury and fancy shopping streets.
With the Bin Laden family found guilty, Muslims send their final journey to Mecca where the crane crashed
After the first funerals in Mecca, the bodies of 29 people who died were carried out on the streets by Muslims
As responsible for the crane accident in Saudi Arabia, the construction giant blamed the Saudi Binladin group
A total of 394 injured after the crane fell, the health ministry reported.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the body of 29 people who lost their lives when a crane fell into the Sacred Mosque.
For the most part, the crowd in white blocked off the roads to send their first funerals to their final journey to the Muysim Cemetery in Mecca.
A few days ago, the painful crowd passed through the sacred place where a crane destroyed the roof of the mosque and fell over the pilgrims.
In the case of 394 wounded, the bodies of the dead were brought to burial after Binladin, the owner of the Saudi Kingdom's construction conglomerate, held responsible.
29 pilgrims who lost their lives in a crane's fall at the Sacred Mosque have been carried on shoulders along the road.
Among the dead was Kasym Akram, the father of four children from the Bolton region of Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell.
Mr. Akram came to the Sacred Mosque at the beginning of the annual pilgrimage with his parents.
Saudi leaders have announced that the pilgrimage will continue with the participation of thousands of pilgrims on their way to Mecca.
King Salman announced today that the Binladin Holding group should not leave the crane's arm open while it is out of use.
The Arabic version of the decree by the state-run Saudi Press Agency stated that Binladin Group was the only person to blame for the incident.
The news agency's English service did not pass that detail, but company officials reported that a ban was imposed on them to leave the country.
At the beginning of the week, Salman vowed that the crane would find its way into the courtyard of the Masjid-i-Haram, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims arrived at the end of the month.
Binladin's group has not made any statement about the overturned crane, and its representatives are not allowed to comment.
The royal decree accused the group of not taking current security measures and not cooperating with meteorological authorities.
The Masjid-i-Haram in Mecca is surrounded by dozens of cranes, most of which are under the direction of the Binladin group.
The Binladin family has been closely associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is the head of most construction projects.
The last leader of Al Qaeda's organization, Osama bin Laden, was a deviant son that the family banned from adoption.
The accident occurred just days before millions flocked into the land of the Hajj, where every adult Muslim was supposed to visit at least once in their lives, at the time of heavy wind and rain.
Officials say 158 people are still being treated at the hospital.
Authorities ordered the families of the deceased and those who survived with permanent injury to be compensated 1 million Rials (174,000 pounds).
The other wounded will take half of that amount.
B&Q boss says there are East European craftsmans behind this trend who work cheaply.
Veronique Laury says the Britannians are hiring more and more masters.
The increase is followed by the number of East European skilled craftsmans
As a result, 200 new Screwfix stores are opening up, targeting the craftsmans.
Kingfisher also closes 60 B&Q sales points across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Reporter
Britannians are said to have started hiring skilled East European craftsmans to do their chores instead of leaving hammers and paintbrushes in their hands.
If you're good at using hammers or painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
Because according to the boss of the company behind B&Q, the Britons are getting more and more masters to do DIY work at their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new general manager of Kingfisher's home improvement chain, said behind this trend was a huge increase in the number of East European skilled craftsmans serving low prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to close 60 B&Q sales points and open another 200 new Screwfix stores for the craftsmans.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted more women hired at B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchases in the store were made by women.
Most of the staff are males now.
More home improvements compared to the past, the single woman said the house was a need to meet developing demographic trends.
" Men are still mostly working in our stores, " said Mrs. Laury.
We need to balance out even more.
Basically, half of our clients are women and 80 percent of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a big part in the decision-making process.
Mrs. Laury, one of the five women leading Britain's leading firms' index of FTSE100, has reconstructed her top team to form an equal number of male and female managers.
Kingfisher, general manager and financial manager, almost 50 percent of his team is single in this area with women.
" It was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here, " said Mrs. Laury.
It wasn't hard to find good women for our board of directors.
After the group was loaded with the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher announced a decline in both sub-month profits and sales.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, owner of Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores
It's time for the US Central Bank to decide whether to increase interest for the Fed
The US Central Bank is being watched by the world at two-day meetings, which continue on Wednesdays and Thursdays, and is expected to decide whether interest rates will be increased in ten years.
In a Reuters survey, a little over half of 80 economists said that the Fed would implement this decision last week, while now they think it will suspend the decision and keep the rate between 0.25 per cent and 0.25 per cent.
Seven years have passed since the Fed dropped the odds to zero, which is historic.
"For the first time, we will witness the process of normalisation of interest rates from the zero point of a large central bank," said Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson International Economic Institute.
The U.S. economy performs relatively well and in the process of reviving the economy, it adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and creates a small amount of inflation.
But the Fed can't ignore the less promising global picture.
He warned the markets against an increase, but there are indications that the situation would not allow such a rise.
The decision will be announced Thursday at 8:00 p.m.
The perpetrator of the murder at Delta State University left an apology letter.
Tuesday morning, authorities said, Shannon Lamb left a note in Mississippi Monday morning saying that she was "sorry" for the first murder, "if I could take it back" before gunning down her girlfriend and later that same day before killing her co-worker.
Mississippi Gautier PD called 911 around 10:00 p.m. Lamb, a geography and social sciences instructor at Delta State University.
Monday, and he said he said he shot someone to death with a gun.
Lamb said he had to send the police to the officer on the phone.
Lamb, who said, "I killed my wife last night," also stated that there was a "sweet dog in the house that didn't hurt anyone" and that he was probably upset.
The police asked the caller his name, but he didn't mention his name.
Lamb didn't give any explanation for the murder.
When the police went to the scene, they found the lifeless body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note by 45-year-old Lamb: "I'm so sorry, I wish I could take back the time.
I loved Amy, and she was the only one who ever loved me.
After Lamb wrote this note, he drove to Delta State 300 miles away and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, and then killed himself when the cops cornered him.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn't know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but "It's obvious that Lamb had something on his mind."
Despite reports Monday that Lamb believed that his girlfriend Prentiss was having an emotional relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday that they had "no information or evidence" that they had "a love triangle."
Shawn O'Steen, who was married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as a "good man."
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but their friendship lasted.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss found a 19-year-old daughter and that she was "destroyed."
O'Steen also stated that Prentiss and his daughter were "absolutely best friends."
According to Linsday Knowless, who Sun Herald described as a close friend of Parentiss, he was working online from the Prentiss house.
Knowles said Prentiss, the owner of a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "He always liked to help others."
Police said Lamb called his relatives on Monday that he said, "I'm not going to jail."
That same night, when the police approached him at Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled over, jumped on foot, ran into the woods and shot himself to death with a gun.
According to his CV published on the University website, Lamb received a PhD in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.

The actor (left) seen with his son Redmond (right) has had several stressful years.
He struggled with leukemia in 2001, and in 2009, his partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
The actor, said to have also struggled with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for possession of drugs.
All of this, of course, has done him a lot of harm.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United is out for months with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered two fractures in Manchester United's Champions League match against PSV Eindhoven.
The one that tears up the defense player remains hopeful that Louis van Gaal Shaw will be back in the field this season, while it will keep him out of the field for at least six months.
The fracture was caused by Shaw, a 20-year-old, who dropped a bomb on the playing field in 15 minutes with Héctor Moreno.
Nine minutes in the field, followed by oxygen before being transferred to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He's got a double fracture on his leg and he's in the hospital."
Maybe he'll be transferred today or a day later, and he'll be in Manchester for surgery.
It's a terrible situation. A young man who was transferred to Manchester at the age of 18 has to have a hard time first, and then he'll have a great game, and then that'll happen to him.
When he was in the locker room, he had an oxygen mask on his face.
She was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, that means at least six months, and you can't play in a group phase.
I'm hoping he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get away with a red card and a penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal claimed the Italian official made a mistake.
You can judge yourself when I say it's a penalty and a red card.
It was a terrible fight with both legs.
The tweet on Shaw's account said, "Thank you all for your messages, it's not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, and I'll return with strength."
Concerned: Luke Shaw suffers from the shock of his injury in the Manchester United PSV defeat
The Champions League, which will be held in France next July, will be moral for the recovery of the English defender.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said, "A terrible injury."
If a injury like this happens to any player, everyone gets upset.
Our players never intend to cripple their opponent.
Moreno also had a broken leg while playing for the Mexican team against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
He found it very difficult because he never intended to maim his opponent, and after hearing that it was a very bad break, he said, it was never good.
I couldn't see it from my point of view.
All I could see was a ball going in a different direction, like Moreno had touched it, but I couldn't see Luke's back.
"I know what it feels like. I know how hard something like this can be.
I feel terrible about it, and I'm so sorry.
Andrés from PSV was taken to the hospital after a fight with Chris Smalling in Guardado.
Of course David Cameron knows the Lorax better than that?
It's something that every parent learns soon: when your child loves a book, it doesn't take much time for you to learn it by heart.
Apparently, if you're not David Cameron.
When asked what his favorite children's book was by a holiday programmer supplier for child care, Prime Minister The Lorax chose Dr. Seuss' 1971 egress story.
"I like to read this book to my children because it has a funny, impressive, creative and powerful message that we always miss, because it contains a vision or message in it," Cameron said in a text message published on the SuperCamps company website.
So far, everything was going pretty well, until Cameron was briefed by the 2012 film version of the book, which he supposedly wrote about the content of the book, but in fact added new characters and details to inflate the content of the original story text.
In the city of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is destroyed, where even the weather is meta, a boy named Ted wants to fulfill his desire to see a real tree in order to win Audrey's heart, including a love story that Dr. Seuss, whose real name is Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991, did not know.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough to you, Cameron's text, in one way or another, is very similar to the brief summary text of The Lora in the Internet Film Archive, which begins with: "In Thneed-Ville, the city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a meta, the dream girl named Ted wants to win Audrey's heart."
According to Cameron's claims that he is a competent parent, it is unlikely that an anonymous young boy would have any knowledge of the main subject of the book of the book, which he heard was destroyed by the greedy, cutting trees, cutting down the trees, cutting down the trees, cutting off the trees, and hearing about the book, which he called the local community, Lorax.
It's possible that such a weak PR job was transferred to an orderly, who apparently didn't read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A woman from the presidential spokesman said the text was thought to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's personnel, but other than that, he didn't comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly at risk of getting out of England, but he's still intact.
Playing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing the British team selected for the tour, I don't think there's a repeat of the loss of the 3-0 test series last time.
Still, I'm not taking a away victory out of the question.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but he's got a good swing in the batting line, and he's got a strong sense of collective play; they don't heal 2012's wounds, they only provide a little youth-based optimism.
In the ball game, Moeen Ali is developing as a game turner, and Fair Rashid represents an attack option, even though the quality of the test level is unknown.
Concerned: Adam Lyth is out of the British Trial Team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to get Adam Lyth out is a difficult decision for me to analyze as his head coach in Yorkshire.
The Seven Trials were against two good attacks under difficult circumstances, and the simple but inevitable fact is that cricketers are judged according to the result.
For example, there were no question marks about Joe Root, and he was stuck with the announcement because -- as I said before -- the players were his best choices.
After a few fifty-point series, Lyth could see his career growing, but he's made his own destiny.
If he works harder for Yorkshire, I'm hoping he'll get another chance.
British head coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude, although he did not perform his best, which doesn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team man.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it would take a test hitter to get a note.
Lyth - like Sam Robson before him - bought seven caps, on the other hand, Nick Compton bought nine.
Only Compton got a chance at a rematch.
The only pain you can feel is that for Jonathan Trott, England first went to the Caribbean -- when Lyth's form peaked -- but that wasted opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales is coming, and I think he's a high-level hitter.
He's an X-factory cricketer, and we saw this in Yorkshire at the beginning of this season when Trent Bridge scored 236 points against us on the field.
It should at least be taken for the same opportunity as the one before it, but of course, it depends on the formation of a team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moeen holding four quicks and getting an extra spinner in front of Cook worked, and I'm not against it.
I don't understand why a batter can't shoot here, and this leftist already showed how good he is as a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his job for Worcestershire, but he saw a number three for them, and it doesn't make much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 trial on his first fall before he started his debut in 2001.
He picked up three hundred straight away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a backup game turner and surprises me as an impressive young man in my limited talks with him.
People can see their raw statistics -- 31 averages and 35 averages in the ball -- and they might think it's a degaj, but there aren't many gamers raising their hands, and the casting choices were made for the younger one.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Away from the team, England seems to have made some subtle additions to its own coaching team.
Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lanka hitman, has been assigned as a consultant for the test matches.
One of the cutest men in that game will bring with it a lot of experience, under all circumstances, and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball foot of the tour and gives both energy and a ruthless series of games.
I always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether he was an actor or a coach, and he has a sense of how to get a guide, like Mahela.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even messages that have been said before, can bring the team some innovation.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is being rested for a day's play, Root has been given a similar stopover to Australia, and I have no problem with that.
Not everyone agrees, but the plans, the coaches, and the players are not made by the voters.
And you have to remember, like the actors, their job depends on the consequences.
Such decisions are never easily made.
Brexit could win a Brexit camp if the economy is still until 2017
David Cameron's half-baked renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse and worse every day, even though Jeremy was elected as leader of Corbyn's Labour Party or TUC was furious about Europe on Tuesday.
Strangers have Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomat said, some member states are tired of Britain's agenda of separatist concessions and disruptive agreement changes, which they don't want most of in the EU, which is completely in a crisis that they don't want.
In his annual interview in Brighton, TUC decided he didn't want them if he hurt social security.
We could even call it Dave and George's own agenda.
The prime minister and Chancellor attend summits or bilateral meetings in the foreign capitals, taking pictures of themselves in front of famous monuments in front of them, or not, and then returning to their country and gathering allies for reform, they say.
This is all about me.
When Berlin said, "Don't leave us alone with France," my European friend, who asked for an extroverted Britain in the EU tent, said that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to a point where they don't care if we stay or not.
Germany's cautious and sane Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years, and she wants to leave power before it goes bad, as in the examples of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces a re-election in France in 2017 or a change in power.
It's a fading force.
Soon, a right-wing nationalist government in Poland and a left-wing government in Spain will come to power.
Selfie Britannians, who need to use their energy to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom, are unlikely to make any effort because they don't want it either, because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may be planning to speed up the Brexit process by making deliberate statements that won't help during the U.K.'s 2017 referendum campaign, in the style of the National Party of Scotland.
"The renegotiation was a dead end," and "Britania gained nothing from renegotiation."
Europeans know from their previous experience how exploitive, oligarchy press barons were against the EU because they weren't like that in Tony Benn's day, and were inspired by the 1975 referendum, which approved our entry from 2 to 1 in 1973.
In the early '90s, they remember Boris Johnson, the chief Euro-oportunist, who announced his name as "EU flat bananas."
All their stupidity aside, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax thugs, foreigners listening to illegal phone calls and alleged foreign residents who owned most of our major newspapers.
As a matter of fact, Tony Blair often felt the same way about them, but when he was trapped in a cage with a horny gorilla, he realized he needed to distract him by giving him bananas so he wouldn't have to feed him for lunch and teatime.
In fact, Miliband was Blairci, who opposed Cameron's brilliant referendum idea, as Blair made a compromise on the EU constitution, which was cancelled in 2005 by French and Dutch voters who gave him the exit card.
The press never forgave him for that either.
But on Monday, when I told him that he had no time to lose to me, Jeremy Corbyn seemed to be in danger of reacquainting Murdoch's boycott strategy in the '80s, which was now just a mistake.
Although it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with the media, not me, especially Andrew Marr, who left the BBC on Sunday.
I politely state Corbyn's official position in Europe in progress.
He says he wants us to stay within a reformed EU.
Most of the people who are left out of Ukip's hostile tendencies and the fierce supporters of Conservative Little England say yes.
That's what Hilary Benn, who's a Benn but isn't Bennite, said on radio and on TV this week because she's naively forced herself not to admit that it was a bad idea for Corbyn to appoint John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor.
It reminded me of his father's struggle to be unfaithful to his fellow workers in the working cabinet in the '70s, and his failure to go too far, and his loss of office in the cabinet.
Hilary's struggle was more attractive.
But in Benn's statement, fighting to stay under "any circumstances" was not the same as what McDonnell said or what JC said to the lords at the special meeting Monday night.
Considering that he touched me, the detail Corbyn was trying to convey continues to maintain the importance of message discipline at the age of TV 24/7 and especially in the social media vortex, which is the source of paranoia and betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it's reasonable to give Cameron a hard time about Europe, which ensures Labour support in the referendum.
That's exactly what Simon Jenkins thinks.
However, the Bennite siege economy and its anti-capitistic past on McDonnell and Corbyn's EU accession are no longer a private debate among left-wing opponents, who are only the cornerstones of the teaching of small differences narcissism.
As with Nato, foreign diplomats who are determined that JC will not campaign to leave will have to make a point of it for their master in their country.
Why would Paris or Berlin lose political capital in Britain, when they have sceptical constituents?
As I was told at the opening of the British Action Safety Forum on Monday, the United States is already very disappointed with the British's poor minimum performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite its cost-reduction Conservative Party government in power.
Experts criticise British Public Health e-cigarate research
At a meeting of 12 people with connections to the tobacco industry, an agency financed by the government, researchers said that e- cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking.
Experts in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) joined Lancet to criticize the evidence that British Public Health (PHE) used in its report on e-cigara.
PHE published its "turn point" report last month, described as "a detailed review of the evidence."
However, some researchers questioned the integrity of the data and pointed out the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Lancet's medical journal's editorial last month aimed at the "excessively rotten foundation" based on PHE's main conclusion.
Two other researchers at BMJ questioned whether the allegations were "builded on sand or rock."
"The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of activity," said Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool and Martin McKee, professor of European public health at London Hygiene and Tropical Medical School.
They said that PHE's allegations that "e-smokes are about 95% less harmful than smoking according to the best estimate available" would be expected to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, the results of this meeting were summarized in a research article to develop a multi-regular decision analysis (MCDA) model to create a synthesis of their views on the damage to various products containing nicotine.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously reported to have received funds from British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also confirmed a certificate of public health for BAT in a sustainability report.
They added that one of the 12 people at the meeting reported having received funds from an e-cigara manufacturer, but this was not previously reported funds from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
The panel members were not informed of how they were chosen, but some of them included the known giants of e-cigara, which some of them reported in the article about industrial funding.
Others present at the meeting are not recognised by their expertise in tobacco control.
The head of tobacco also attended the meeting at PHE.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group's research article "in effect" admitted that according to many criteria there was a lack of concrete evidence about the damage of most products."
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said it was too early to claim that "there is no evidence that e-cigaras are a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers."
Prof Kevin Fenton, director of health and prosperity at PHE, said the allegations at BMJ have already been answered.
He said: "E-cigaries are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One in two lifetime smokers dies from this addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks caused by e-cigaras are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear mandate: to inform the public of what the evidence shows and does not show, especially in a period of disorientation about its damage when compared with tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die of a smoking disease a year, and smoking costs NHS £2 billion a year.
We carry out our national responsibility by making it clear that the existing evidence -- not without risk -- is only a small fraction of the damage caused by smoking.
The previous Channel 4 chief said the BBC should release EastEnders.
Luke Johnson, the former Channel 4 president, said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and said that ad competitors could "give right arms" for hit shows such as Albert Square.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, such as BBC4, which could be watched by a smaller audience, against the highest ratings of its opponents during precious intervals.
After the BBC's chief director, Tony Hall, said the institution wanted to co-operate more with other organisations, Johnson said in his own time on Channel 4 that it was unsuccessfully tried for six years to create a connection with the BBC.
During an interrogation of the future of the BBC, Johnson said to the House of Lords communications committee, "I am struggling with the idea that the BBC should order and publish programs that can be clearly shown by unsubstantiated competitors."
If you continue to apply a license fee that I'm not sure is a good idea in the middle or long term, your output should be reduced at least to programs that others do not or do not order.
He publishes The Voice in the primetime range because they want to provide as much support as possible for the future.
The idea here is based on the idea that no one else is going to publish it, which is ridiculous and clearly ridiculous.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why programs that can be funded without help should be funded by a reduced rate of tax.
The Voice is another one, and it's actually done within the company.
To be honest, other channels would give their right arm for that.
I'm trying to see what public service publications are like.
I don't think that's going to diminish the BBC at all.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of seeking ratings "because of the passion of the people working here and because these workers see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support."
Comments on BBC's most popular programs repeat the comments of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used MacTaggart in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer the BBC to sell its programs, such as EastEnders.
Johnson said the BBC's more appropriate public service programmes are going to BBC4 and that they can't be monitored here, but they'll be able to cover the tax pardon and continue their show-and-telling duties on providing grounds for £4 billion in license fees, and he added: "We're also doing all these silent programs that no one has ever seen."
They put them in spaces where no one will ever see them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I invite you to find a more regressive system for those who have the best benefits.
Of course you're all thinking, we're all thinking, 150 pounds a year is a big deal, but I'm wondering if they're doing this for people whose 150 pounds are a lot of money because they don't watch too much BBC.
At the same time, former Sky and Channel 5 administrator David Elstein, who presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should revisit the Reithian mission "for information, training and entertainment."
Some of the BBC's exit is now officially classified as education -- this is 1% of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio -- and he said public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be the front footline for it, and it should be replaced as "information, lighting and training."
In terms of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do something about only a handful of Proms shown on TV and go into partnerships with advertising publishers to ensure that all of them are monitored online.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
The video shows how threadworms changed direction the moment they were hit by sound vibrations.
Scientists have grown maggots with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by soundwave explosions.
Tiny threadworms change direction when they're hit by sound vibrations at a high altitude that people can't hear.
Vibrations are activated by activating genetically modified motor nerve cells to transport membrane conduits that respond to trans-sound waves.
Interested: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
Researchers say that maggots have proven the power of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, so that the ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
At the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, researcher Sreekanth Chalasani told the Guardian that this procedure could one day be replaced by deep-brain stimulation, an intervention procedure that provides electrical vibrations into people's brains to treat symptoms of Parkinson's disease.
Fiberworms don't often react beyond sound, but Chalasani found that they react when they're surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles he found strengthens the trans-sound waves so that they can pass through the maggots.
The amplified trans-sound waves affect structures found in the membranes of some worm cells called TRP-4 ion conduits.
According to a report published by Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate cells they are connected to.
To create threadworms controlled by trans-sound, Chalasani genetically altered the worms to allow some motor neurons to transport TRP-4 ion conduits.
When he applied the transmutations to the modified creatures, the sound waves were reinforced by micro-cabaroids and transmitted into the maggots and activated motor neurons that were modified here.
This procedure is similar to optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to run and shut down neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says that sonogenesis may have some advantages to this technique.
Unlike the light that should be sent through an optical fiber into the brain, low-frequency wave can pass through the tissue uninterrupted, so that they can be sent through the skull into the brain.
"We believe that human neurons targeted in a clinical environment for specific neurological treatments can be temporarily sensitive to trans-sound signals, using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus," Chalasani said.
Other applications can be concentrated on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment - right on your doorstep!
Advertisements condemn Britain's arms trade
Watch the international anti-weapons fair video.
Horrible killer drones!
The shackles that broke your ankle!
Fragmental bombs!
And electric-shocked batons that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
The British government's ExCel Center at London Wharf, designed to highlight its desire to sell weapons to oppressive regimes internationally, has no doubt that the world's largest weapons fair is a sharp hoax.
Concerned: DSEI gun fair: authoritarian regimes attack in London
However, a different campaign continues with posters from bus stops and subway trains, and requires double-checking.
One says, using London Metro fonts and brands to turn the DLR line into a tank, "The important announcement is, will you travel at DLR from September 15th to September 18th?"
This September, a pack of arms dealers are going to attack the DLR... and customers are being asked to help stop this weapons fair.
300 posters are from artists at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Bansky's Dismaland.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group has helped distribute it using "The Impact Packages to the Advertisement Area," which is £6, which claims to have "accessed about a third of the bus stop ad spaces on the planet."
Transport for London wasn't satisfied with this poster "vidalism."
One of the ads was created by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Gavin Grindon, a curator of Cruel Designs and a professor at the University of Essex, artists are more and more interrogating every day and are looking for ways to move political affairs to the masses outside the gallery.
Many artists are acting with activists in protest movements, and they're beginning to realize that in order for their art to have an impact on society, they have to go out into the real world.
Another anti-arm trade poster also faces those traveling on the subway.
The video of Amnesty International has been monitored over 100,000 times over Facebook in 24 hours, and is created by a free VCCP advertising agency, and the graphic designer and the sound artist have prepared it for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence of the gun fair ads -- the free space in the ExCel calendar -- and he thought, "Let's give them a campaign where they're trying to escape."
They played with the idea of making a more realistic, subtle corporate ad, but "They've decorated it with bright colors and animation, and it's more remarkable."
"They have helped us to create concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair," said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
What we need now is for the British government to act and prevent torture equipment from being illegally sold on our doorstep.
Maybe the most creative art at the gun show comes from the inside ExCel, where exhibitors sell fantastic cover products.
In a press release, Saab showed the US military's order of "At4CS RS" launched from our shoulder.
It's got a "warfare with no resemblance and a massive impact on the target by entering the armor."
Whatever he's doing, it's not gonna be cool.
Eight golden rules of living in student dorms
It's been 11 years since I moved to student dorms as an unrelated 19-year-old, and I still believe in bruises and moral relativity, but now I remember the fake smiles of my annoyances -- and the numerous long complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be distilled in eight golden rules.
Moving to the dorm can follow from annoying to completely terrifying.
The seduction of chatter: where you're from people, where you're not losing years, where you're insisting on Corbyn, and why you're saying, "I don't like Marmite or hate Marmite, because really, gentlemen, that's just yeast in my room."
Take a breath.
And let the others have one - ask questions and pay attention.
It will direct this conversation, and if your eyelashes catch fire and they squeeze fire extinguishers, it will help you separate the people you like from the people you don't talk to.
Give the people some space.
People's rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and group hangouts, but these are also places where people dress and adjust their underwear.
Interested: Don't even think about starting a relationship with the university
Introverts get treated badly in college.
Your room may be a retreat, but many dorm halls develop an inter-room culture, which is friendly, social, and open to lifelong friendships.
This could be hell for someone who's trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will allow you to say, "I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to leave a little bit, so I can replace the energy I've spent communicating with you."
Try to sense that a friend of yours is tired of socializing and maybe text instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A friend at the student dorm had a policy that he was invited in if the door wasn't locked.
He's seen a lot of things.
Don't make friends through cooking.
Ever since you started college at the top of the food contest craze, it's going to be less weird and less 1950s to introduce yourself by knocking on people's doors with a plate of brownies, and it's going to be, "Welcome to our neighborhood, I cooked you something, now smile while I ask you personal questions."
Giving people home-made treats is a great way to make friends.
Perhaps your roommates will feel compelled to talk and associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Frankly, this is about you being a master cook.
A lumpy lump of dough, sugar and oil will make people pretend they're asleep when you knock on the door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dorms.
To be honest, it's stealing someone's chicken, but stealing a few drops of milk for your tea?
Check the milkman twice.
He'll probably tell you to take care of yourself, even if he's swimming in it.
It's very uncomfortable for someone to steal their stuff, and I understand, but try to deal with it in a more mature way than my dormmate, who put in liquid soap to punish the person who stole it.
He's in jail now.
Do not make noise to keep people from sleeping or studying.
It doesn't just mean to be a decent person, but because you're just people in glass houses.
A girl in my hallway told her next door neighbor to take the drums down a little bit because it's 3:00 in the morning and she's taking the morning test.
His answers were to turn up the volume even more.
When they finally closed at 5:00 in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before she went to her own three-hour test, turning her music on and locking the door.
Wouldn't it be romantic for your future wife to move in with you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be weird if you misunderstood a friend in the hall and thought you were your future wife and had to hang out and see her every day and watch your mutual friends be taken prisoner?
Of course, that's the heart, but if your hot hallway neighbor is definitely not your future wife, at least talk to the little one and advise common sense.
When you see someone leaving their keys unlocked in a cheerful moment, know that the line between joking and bullying is thinner than you think.
A good joke is fun, but it'll take time to get back.
You can teach someone a valuable and fun lesson in safety by hiding their stuff -- but never get someone's room dirty with shampoo and toothpaste.
Lock your doors and put your keys in the freezer in a glass of water, but don't stick your stuff on the ceiling more than twice.
Parliament Speaker of immigrant origin to Holland
Arib won the highest vote in the fourth round of the vote held in parliament yesterday, becoming Dutch's first immigrant-rooted legislature president.
Arib, also a Moroccan citizen, will take over until 2017.
Arib had also been running for president in 2012, when he served as parliament since 1998, but was not elected.
Hope Bulut's surprise suitor!
The final offer came from Eskişehirspor, who did not make up with G.SARAY fans, and was depressed by the protests of the bleachers in the last match.
He missed this position, wanted out of the game!
During Ryan Donk's transfer, Eskişehirspor took the final step for the national goalkeeper Kasympaşa wanted to join the team.
However, the red-blacks were negatively answered by the G.Saray administration.
As she became beautiful, her heart stopped.
Last Monday, Raquel Santos (28), the mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, applied to her plastic doctor to remove traces of laughter on the edges of her mouth.
The woman who was injected in the face with fillings soon increased her heart rate and breathing.
He died after his heart stopped.
Police are investigating whether Potenay, the drug she uses daily, was involved in her death.
The real cause of death will be post-mortem.
Debora Azevedo, one of the model's closest friends, told the Brazilian press that Santos, a 7 and 13-year-old son, was obsessed with plastic surgery.
Santos, who joined Moses do Brasil last December, was second in Brazil's most important beauty contest.
Oil companies have officially collapsed.
About $400 billion in investments have been postponed from 2014, when oil prices began to drop, to the end of last year, while the most deep sea (deepwater) oil exploration projects have been suspended.
According to a survey by the consulting company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices, oil and gas search/production put the $380 billion project on hold, while millions of barrels of production were postponed from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa in a wide geography.
"The company budgets have been dramatically narrowed," the report, showing oil prices dropped to the lowest level of 12 years, losing 70 per cent in a year and losing 70 per cent in the summer of 2014, as the biggest cause of cost cuts.
400 MILAR DOLLARS ASKIDA
Raw oil prices have been making new surprises day after day, and have seen the lowest level of the last 12 years, reduced to under $30.
The study published by Wood Mackenzie, an energy consulting company, reveals how the industry has been affected by the down prices, when the debates on whether oil is now cheap or cheap.
Finally, Wood Mackenzie, who found in his July report that low oil prices caused the suspension of 46 large energy investments of $200 billion, reveals where that figure reached by the end of 2015.
According to this, 22 other major projects have been postponed in the last six months of 2015, while 68 major projects have been suspended in total since the fall in oil began in 2014.
These projects are worth about $400 billion.
SUN 2.9 MILLIONS
The research, stressing that low oil prices are "innocent" to the company's plans, said the most affected projects are deep-sea development projects.
The projects suspended totalled 27 billion barrels of raw oil equivalents, thus delaying the production of 2.9 million barrels of oil per day by 2025.
According to the study, most of the projects' final investment decision was postponed until 2017 and later, while the first production goals were set between 2020 and 2023.
"The majority of $170 billion is deep sea projects."
That's because the cost of pre-investment is too high.
"70 per cent of deep sea spending is mainly oil-based projects in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico," they say.
According to the research, the countries with the most delayed oil project inventory are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have almost 90 percent of the delayed liquid reserves.
Mobambik, Australia, Malaysia, and Indonesia, are the countries with the largest number of delayed gas reserves, as well as 85 per cent.
While much of the gas waiting to come out here is in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions, such as setting up a zero-smelling gas (LNG) facility.
The most endangered companies are oil giants in the deep sea, Canadian oil sand, and in the Caspian region, while the companies are also trying to adapt to the scenario of "longer low" oil prices, it is said.
EYE IN IRAN
There was a painting about four years ago: the United States and Europe brought embargos to Iran to stop Tehran's nuclear program, the oil barrel price was about 110 dollars, and the Iranian oil exports were discussed how to reduce without causing a sudden spike in prices.
And when we come back this week, we see a different scenario.
Oil prices have seen for the first time since 2004 under $30, and the main reason for that was the US production explosion, and the embargoes for Iran are going up.
That's why we have eyes on Iran.
If Iran increases oil exports, more and more oil will flow into the oil market, which is already quite satisfied.
This could also cause prices to go below the levels that surprise us today.
Some analysts say Saudi Arabia, which does not want to give Iran a market share, will pump up more oil and there may be a price war between Iran and S. Arabia.
As soon as the sanctions are lifted, Iran's main goal is the rapidly growing oil market in Asia, its former partners in India and Europe, reportedly.
In their earlier statements, Iranian officials said they were aiming to increase exports by 500,000 barrels a day, and after a while to release that amount more.
According to Reuters map information, at least 13 of them are full or large, while 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCC) are waiting off the coast of Iran.
Iran is the fourth largest proven oil reserves in the world.
Thanks to the exceptions of sanctions, Iran is still exporting about 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries, including Turkey.
Prior to the sanctions, Iran's daily export of oil was up to 3 million barrels per day.
"Chinese-based global growth is increasing pressure on commodity prices, while the loss of oil prices is deepening," said Support Securities Research Expert Aysun Göksu.
In China, the world's largest oil importer, we see oil has reached 20% since New Year's, with concerns that the demand for oil will be reduced in parallel with economic slowdown.
In addition, due to the global value gain of dollars and the global supply surplus problem, we can witness prices in oil under $30 in the coming days.
As long as we don't see permanent pricings on the 32-33 levels, the rise in oil can be limited and the low pressure can increase.
At this point, closes below the critical 30 dollar level could be said to have a key role in keeping the declines going.
In such a case, it should not be a surprise to see looseness that lasts until the 23.30-25.60 support area below.
Isham Sardouk: 'The age of angels is over!'
Why turn the course to Turkey when Victoria's Secret and the WGSN, which determines the fashion currents of the world, take the role of trending creativity?
- I'm always for change.
I was born in Paris, lived in London, then went to New York.
I took important positions there, too.
Meanwhile, I've been giving Koton counsel for the last two years.
And then I saw the potential in this geography and the Koton brand.
I realized there was everything I needed to be a chain of stores around the world.
Now I'm here to make it happen.
Will you be able to do it soon?
- Absolutely.
It's already a young brand, but it's already sold in 50 countries.
We collect 50 collections a year, 15 episodes.
So there's everything a chain of stores should have.
We can respond to consumer needs from Dubai to Moscow in different geographys.
Now we're opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting...
Is it necessary to open a store in Paris?
- Yeah.
Not because Europe's economic situation is fantastic.
But you open some stores for image.
You have a shop in fashion capitals like Paris, London, you make money in the Middle East.
One puts prestige on the brand, the other puts money on it, both are necessary for a brand that plays globally.
So let's talk trends...
- We have a very romantic, elegant season ahead of us.
Flying dressers, soft shades, pinks, whites, reds.
The patterns...
We're going through a very difficult and brutal time, and in these difficult times, the fashion world always tries to add a little bit of happiness to life by moving elegant, refreshing designs to the podium.
That's what we do.
That's why in the new season, "the age of misery" is coming back.
Let's get back to your years at Victoria's Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I'm not just talking about her gorgeous physique, she's so positive, she's such a good girl!
When I was working, he'd sit next to me and feed me apples and stuff like, "Honey, are you hungry?"
He was that sweet.
You know, I looked into what I was talking about, and you interviewed all the Victoria's Secret models.
Isn't Karolina beautiful?
But Adriana Lima impressed me with her beauty.
- Say yes, that voice!
That speech, that tone...
After a while, you get nervous, and you say, "Sit aside and look beautiful, and don't do anything else!"
It's a pain in the ass.
That's right, these shocks happen.
I interviewed Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen, but I was terrified of her empty-mindedness.
- Most of them are now.
New angels aren't what they used to be...
I remember when Gisele was...
Although it was pretty hard to work with him.
He'd come backstage and smoke like a chimney.
Not that he's a smoker.
Nobody can drink, he's the only one who can.
Let's just do the diva thing.
The Victoria's Secret fashion show, released two months ago, received the lowest ratings in its history.
Why do you think?
Like I said, it's over with those legendary beautiful angels.
I'm sorry, who needs Gigi Hadid?
What's so good about it?
Kendall Jenner, like wood.
No curves, nothing.
Kate Moss has zero curves, but she's the biggest name in the fashion industry.
- Yeah, but her face was so beautiful.
I'd like to exercise my right to object here.
I interviewed him last year, and he had a pretty bad face...
- All this smoking, drinking, now it's ugly.
But she had such a beautiful face in the '90s.
Her lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
He had reached the end of his supermodel era.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell, Christy Turlington...
Christy was my next-door neighbor, and I saw her without makeup every morning.
Such pure beauty can't be such grace.
And Cara Delevingne?
- He's wasting himself.
It's not every campaign.
People are getting sick of it.
Anyway, there's no hunger for celebrity models or celebrity like there used to be.
People want to see real faces like themselves in campaigns.
That's what we're gonna go for.
Because it's trending.
Turkey's letter from 25 writers
Writers including presidents of the International Association of Writers (PEN) Britain, Wales and Scotland, according to BBC Turkish, said threats and physical attacks aimed at their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
Two attacks aimed at the daily Hurriyet in Turkey included the arrest of the Koza group and the detention of Vice News correspondents, investigations and arrests against journalists as well as alarming developments.
Mother's half right to work had a debate.
"We believe that mothers are given half-work so that rent labor can be restored," Turkish-Busk said.
"This could be a Trojan horse," he said, and TİSK said, "We are concerned if this arrangement, which will be in the women's favor, will prevent women from working."
The new rights scheduled for officers and working women to be given to employees after birth or adoption have passed through the commission with all day's talks.
The most common issue in the commission talks was "restriction labor," which provided six months of postpartum work or free leave, and part-time work for the child until they reach the elementary school age.
According to CHP MP Musa Çam, who said they had some concerns but had a partial study until the child went to elementary school, he said, "If you bring the contracting arrangement after this, we will face it to the end."
Enis Bağdadioglu, who attended the commission talks on behalf of Turkish-Busk, expressed similar concerns, saying "We have doubts about how to replace the female worker in part-time work."
"That is why we will be anxiously monitoring developments in private employment offices," he said, saying, adding that there will be new problems that will cross the subcontractorial work on this occasion.
"Such long-term partial work does not exist in other countries," TİSK Secretary General Bkent Pirler said, saying the law has brought in partial work for 5 years.
Look at it this way.
"In places with 1 or 2 employees, you have to think about the consequences of this practice," he said.
The TOBB Counsellor Ahmet Şağar said he would have trouble finding workers if the practice were to live.
"It must be reached between the workers and the employers who have come up with an arrangement for private employment offices," he said, saying there are no legislation on the rules to be enforced during part-time work.
Metin Feyzioğlu: We do not support
"We are not participating in this declaration, there is no way we can participate and support it," Feyzioglu explained.
Because there's not a sentence of criticism for the PKK.
You couldn't say anything negative to the PKK, to the separatist terrorist organization, and you didn't put dust on it.
We don't see them seriously and we don't find them sincere, just by taking into account the heavy statements made against the state alone.
We're lawyers, we're lawyers.
If the government's representatives, public officials, security forces, have any illegal behavior in this framework, let's follow it.
When we say, "Don't overthrow the state," they attack us with sympathy for separatists or separatists.
When we say, "This state must act in accordance with the law, always uphold the law," they say, "You are a separatist."
We're the bridge.
We're always bound to tell the truth.

Who is Bergen?
Bergen, originally known as Belgin Huddler, was born in Mersin on 16 July 1960.
With his parents' divorce, his mother settled in Ankara with Sebahat Çakır in 1966.
Yenimahalle entered the Ankara State Conservatory Piano section after Yunus Emre Elementary School, but he left and worked at PTT for a while, raising his age due to financial difficulties.
In 1979, after performing at the Feyman Night Club where he went to have fun with his friends, he accepted his offer to work.
At the Feyman Night Club, he performed with the Group Engine Orchestra, with repertoires consisting of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music, and the fashion of the era.
Bergen, who went to Adana on business after Ankara, met Halis Serbes here and married a year later.
In 1982, he released his first longplay from Atlas Records, "I Have a Musical."
Bergen, who couldn't stand her husband's violence as art continued in his life, ran away from his wife many times.
In October 1982, while working in Izmir, her husband was forced to confront her.
In this attack, Bergen, who lost one eye and most of the body burned, was persuaded and brought to the stage by Genghis Özseker, the composer of the song "Who Knows?" that made him famous after the treatment.
By 1985, the artist performed at the Izmir Diamond Pavyon, owned by Ozheker, with his boss, prepared a demo called "Sister Destiny," and sent it to Yasar Kekekeva.
Liked Bergen, Kekeva invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist, who produced the first professional longplay in the Istanbul music market, "Man Loves" as Burhan Bayar's music director, became famous for her "Woman of Pain" in late 1986.
In April 1987, the album was awarded the Golden Record and the Golden Tape, titled "The Best Salen Arabesque Artist" in 1986 by the record label.
In the same year, Yalçın Gülhan, Asuman Arsan, and Meral Niron were filmed and directed by Ülkü Erakalin.
Bergen, who received a huge fan base, survived a knife attack in Adana, where he went for the concert at the last minute.
He also released the albums "Burn Him," "The Price of My Love," and "I Don't Want."
In April 1989, Bergen, officially divorced from her husband, performed his return to the stage in June 1989 with his last album, "The Years Don't Forgive."
The artist, who began promotional tours of the album, which was received with intense interest, was shot to death by his wife, who divorced her on August 14, 1989 on August 15th.
His hometown was buried in Mersin.
Bergen included five longplays and 129 videos in his 29-year short life.
Claims that the artist who signed the arabeske with a different and powerful voice became a legend came true when the album "My Youth Gone" was released after his death.
Bergen's official studio albums:
1982 - I have a complaint with LP (reprinted MC in 1986).
1983 - Brother Destiny was reprinted as an MC in 1985 and 1990.
1985 - Human Love LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999)
1986 - Woman of Pain LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999)
1987 - Burn it, God, LP, MC, reprinted as a CD in 1999.
1988 - The Price of My Love MC was reprinted as a CD in 1999.
1988 - I don't want LP, MC (reprinted as CD in 1999).
1989 - Years No Forgiver (As its last album) MC (1999) was reprinted as a CD.
1990 - My Outgoing Youth was reprinted as a CD in 1999.
The 1990 - Garibin Passion at the Grave Biter MC (1999) was reprinted as a CD.

Nazim Hikmet was mentioned on his 114th birthday
In the 114th year of his birth, Nazim Hikmet Ran, known as the Country Poet, was commemorated by the "Happy Birthday Nazim" event.
The event, organised by the host municipality, took place in the hall in which the poet's name was named at the Beautyan Cultural Centre.
The music and poetry of the famous poet were performed at the event, and the poetry of the famous poet, the theatre and film actor Rüstü was voiced by the Asian.
He also accompanied the Asian with comments from the Three Anatolian Music Society.
Nazim Hikmet accompanied the event in many art lovers.
These names included Ali Sekkiner Buyer, Erkoç Grandrun, Nedim Star and Zeynep Gökneur Star and Ziya Ozkukmen.
In Istanbul, the event was organised by the Nazim Hikmet Culture and Art Foundation.
Foundation President Rutkay Aziz and members met in Tarabia for the event, the daughter of Vera Tulyakova, daughter of Nezim Hikmet's wife, son-in-law and grandson, actor Tarik Akan.
He will read poems and leave carnations in the sea with the slogan, "To live like a tree and to live as one and free / and like a forest as a brother."
The event, organised by Sarıyer Municipality, will be accompanied by the songs of the Enlightenment Hikmet Choir.
Nazim Hikmet was born on January 15, 1902.
The poems of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet have been translated into more than 50 languages.
He has been arrested repeatedly for his political thoughts and has spent most of his adult life in prison or exile.
His poems were translated into more than fifty languages and his works received many rewards.
He died on June 3, 1963.
The City of Lotus has performed special studies on the 114th birthday of the world-famous poet Nazim Hikmet.
For the first time in the history of Turkey, the municipality has also produced a personal stamp for the poet, as well as for the documentary "Bursa's Nazimi" about Nazim's 11-year-old days in Bursa Prison.
Thus, PTT co-operated with the first personal stamp on behalf of Nazim Hikmet in Turkey's history.
This special stamp, which costs $1.40, and its first day envelopes will be presented to guests on Thursday (January 14th) on a night held at the Nazim Hikmet Cultural House.
They'll be deported by bicycle
However, since no agreement was reached between the two countries, refugees, mostly Syrian, will have to return to Russia this time by pedaling at minus 20 degrees.
On the grounds that it was safer and cheaper in summer, a group of refugees flew to Russia and moved north from Murmansk to Norway.
The agreement between the two countries was not allowed to cross the border on foot, so immigrants crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to send these refugees back.
Therefore, Norwegian police ordered the repair of abandoned bicycles across the border.
EU crisis "3 billion euros to Turkey"
The crisis over 3 billion euros committed to Turkey for refugees continues.
European Commission President Jean Claude Juncker criticised Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi's blocking funds for Turkey.
The mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, Juncker said, stressing that the EU must find 3 billion euros.
"This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey."
We haven't reached 3 billion yet.
"This is a matter of the EU's credibility, therefore it is important," he said.
Juncker said he expects the money to be completed by January 26th, the previous deadline.
Italy is among the countries with a positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources say that Rome's stance on the financial package is not a direct move towards Turkey, and that it is linked to problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some Union countries.
There has been tension between Italy and the EU for some time.
At the last EU summit on energy, banking and immigrants, Renzi continued to strongly criticise German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the EU.
"Renzi should stop blaming the EU."
"Renzi, who I love very much, is wrong to insult the EU Commission at every opportunity," he said.
Juncker implied Renzi was playing in public.
1 billion of the 3 billion euros promised to Turkey will be covered by the EU budget.
2 billion euros will come from the budgets of member states.
Germany will contribute at least 427m euros.
For political reasons, the Greek Administration has agreed to transfer its 2.3m euro share of funds to the EU budget to support Jordan and Lebanon.
The source is envisioned to be used during 2016-2017.
I cried when I saw the Charlie Hebdo cartoon.
Speaking to Russian official news agency Sputnik, father Abdullah Kurdi reacted sharply and said, "I actually cried about this cartoon."
He said, "I feel terrible."
The French satire magazine Charlie Hebdo, who became a symbol of freedom of expression after the shooting, stated that they expected positive things.
Unfortunately, they made a bad cartoon.
Everyone's very upset about this cartoon.
Aylan is a 2-year-old boy and he's dead.
Aylan was supposed to respect me and my family, but it was the other way around.
This magazine should show respect for the dying child.
They published a disrespectful cartoon about our Prophet.
They even broadcast about God.
It's a little thing that happens to my child in front of God and the Prophet.
The Kurdi, who lived in Erbil, called: "My call to the world and to the comics magazine must be respected by all the children who die."
It shouldn't hurt their families, it shouldn't add pain to their pain.
Aylan Kurdi's aunt Tima Kurdi, who lives in Canada, was one of those who reacted to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau, in the signed cartoon, hinted that the three-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who crashed his lifeless body on the basement shore, may have been one of the molesters in Germany when he grew up.
Because Muhammad published cartoons last year, the French comic book Charlie Hebdo, who was attacked by radical religiousists for killing 12 people, became the focus of the debate again because of his cartoon of Aylan Kurdi.
The cartoon depicts pigs-faced and migrants who chase women, as in women's abuses during Christmas celebrations in Cologne, Germany in particular.
The cartoon that causes different reactions in social media is actually part of a four-square column.
The column says, "This is not France," and according to many readers, growing anti-Muslimism has been criticised, along with the other values of France that have been lost.
On the other hand, the cartoon still led many to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
In a issue published last year, the magazine Charlie Hebdo praised Germany, which agreed to receive 800,000 refugees, while criticising France's unwillingness to open its doors to immigrants.
The cartoon said, "He was so close to his goal," and the billboard said, "Two children's menus for the price of one."
'To the Germans who died in Sultanahmet, the autopsy is in Germany.'
According to Der Spiegel's weekly website, the German Federal Prosecutor's Office has decided that the body of 10 people who lost their lives in the attack should be brought to Germany.
The funerals of the dead will be attended by a German Air Force plane today or tomorrow at the country and airport.
In Germany, experts from the Federal Criminal Agency (BKA) identification commission, which performs forensic procedures, go to countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks, where they perform identification and autopsies.
Der Spiegel magazine, however, wrote that the situation would be different this time.
According to the magazine, authorities from the Federal Criminal Office have applied to Turkish authorities to identify the dead and perform the autopsy in Istanbul, but Turkish officials have rejected the proposal.
The Federal Criminal Agency sent four experts to Istanbul after the Istanbul attack.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack continue their treatments at the hospital.
Ellen Meixins Wood died.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was particularly prominent in his work on the origins of capitalism.
The works of Latvian Meixins Wood, born in New York in 1942, were published in Turkish as follows: Escape from class -- the Arracic Culture of Capitalism -- the Origin of Capitalism -- the Empire of Capitalism -- Back to Marx.
No swimming pools for asylum seekers
German media reported that the municipal ban would be lifted if the country's social workers reported that the ban was understood by asylum seekers.
Markus Schnapka, a social agency official who told the WDR that the municipality does not want to punish the innocent for the actions of several people, said they have informed the residents in three languages of the values that are important in Germany.
The municipality will punish all kinds of assaults and harassment, Schnapka said, noting that Germany is arguing about the value of gender equality that it cares about.
On the other hand, the carnival crossing in Rheinberg has been canceled because of the possibility that harassment scandals in Cologne will occur in the upcoming carnival parades.
The municipality announced that the carnival parade had been cancelled because there was no guarantee that there would be no harassment.
What are the benefits of steam cooking?
The steam cooking technique, a technique that doesn't kill vitamins and minerals in food, is becoming increasingly popular.
Steam cooking, one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East for centuries, makes metabolism stronger and easier to digest.
In this way, bacteria and microbes in nutrients, such as indigestion, are dying completely.
The proteins in the food, cellulose and starch, are completely melting with this technique, which makes the food softer.
A low - pressure steam cooker is made in a pot with the help of steam containers or steam engine.
In high pressure cooking, the amount of water used and the amount of cooking is low.
This can be shown as the best example of cooking in a pressure cooker.
To cook foods like vegetables, especially on diet menus, you have to wash vegetables thoroughly and then put them in a filter and wait for them to glide.
A deep pot is filled with one third of water, and the steam filter is placed inside the pot.
The pot is left with its mouth half closed.
This allows the steam to get out of the pot.
The January fever is first brought to the highest level, allowing the water to boil, and then bringing the furnace fever to a lower level to a constant temperature.
In the steam, vegetables and nutrients cooked for about 10 to 15 minutes are checked with the help of a fork after they are well cooked.
Baked vegetables are taken from the stove and served on plates.
In steam cooking technique, the appearance, color, and smell of food do not change, so this method is healthy.
The food itself tastes the same.
That way, the quality and flavor of the food will be intact.
In steam cooking, one of the most economic cooking methods, food loss is kept to a minimum.
Steamed vegetables provide a satisfying feast for those who eat with more vivid and vivid appearance.
This method, especially used in diet foods, is often preferred because it is light.
David Bowie - Blackstar: Alien's "last" album
Knowing that you're going to die, making that last album without telling anyone, making the death bed an artistic expression in your video...
This kind of work may seem too far-fetched for us earthling mortals.
I call them Earth mortals because I'm among those who truly believe that the man who did this is both immortal and alien.
He came from another part of the universe to our world, and now he's back home, and that's all that happened.
He came because not only was there an inspiration to Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga, but to all the world artists.
He's done his duty well.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes price: 9.99 TL 5/5
Probably from the same planet as him, from Warhol, from Kubrick.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, "Is that something?" And he got mixed up with us by singing "Space Oddity."
He didn't really get involved; he always took a few steps ahead.
Many have found their way through him.
He's a musician and a listener...
It would be unfair to say, "It was just music" to his music, aside from his interest in plastic art and acting and all that.
From song to song, the characters that he himself created, his references, his innovation, his propudecrity, and his discography are an artistic integrity to me.
I can't call him the ancestor of glam rock or punk's cousin...
If I do, what about those avant-garde electronic moves, the jazz he's kept in him since he was a kid?
David Bowie kept reminding us of the meaning of the word until these years when we were chewing on the word "con."
It wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman, it wasn't a man.
It was a body.
He appeared to us for a while because of a mission.
That body left this world two days after its 26th studio album, "Blackstar," was released.
Before the album was released, he tried to train us to go with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus."
We thought, "He's old, he's talking about death or something," and he knew everything.
One last game...
Other than the great "Blackstar" and "Lazarus," which bear the burden of message and emotion of the album, it was published a long time ago, but it was redesigned for this album, "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime), "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore" and the number of songs we knew were released when the album was released.
All that's left is "Girl Loves Me," "I Can't Give Everything Away," and "Dollar Days."
When we look at it all, it's built on a very powerful musical structure, but it's like it's made with a very intimate, instant sense, "Blackstar..."
No death, no "getting even with the past" album...
It's just a real last album.
It's the "The End" of a musical life with a masterpiece from beginning to end.
Turkey targeted in Sultanahmet attack
Germany's Federal Police Department President Holger Münch announced Tuesday's attack on Sultanahmet Square in a programme attended by the German First Channel ARD about the death of 10 German citizens.
Münch said Turkey, not German citizens, was the target of the attack.
"400 IN VICTIM"
However, Münch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the danger of terrorism in Germany, saying "We are still under a threat that should be taken seriously."
The number of people from Germany who went to Syria to join ISIS has declined, Münch said, noting that many have returned from war zones.
"There are almost 400 dangerous people we are not supposed to keep in custody at the moment," Münch said, expressing that this is a huge challenge for security units.
In Europe, Münch demanded improvement of co-ordination among police agencies and closer communication.
Turkish officials have stated that the live bomb that staged the Sultanahmet attack was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the assailant's identity has yet to be identified.
Sezen Aksu is saying goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year in a concert series, fascinated his fans with his "Sezenian Years" concert at the Volkswagen Arena last night.
The first part of the July concert series was held in the Volkswagen Arena on January 15th and 16th.
Aksu took all his listeners from yesterday to today on a 40-year journey.
In addition to the love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu performed songs on social matters that concerned our country and our world.
Aksu, who said he would say goodbye to his stage life after performing the concerts he promised, upset his fans.
At the concert, Sezen Aksu appeared in front of the fans who filled the Volkswagen Arena with a separate story in each piece.
Each story, show, light, and stage show took the audience to a different era.
In the final part of the unforgettable concert, there was also a video show, including the paintings of Istanbul by the Revolution Erbil.
For the first time, Aksu also hosted fans' pre-recorded videos on the stage.
25 cents increase in bread in Ankara and Istanbul
In Ankara, 250 grams of bread increased by 25 cents yesterday, and was sold for $1.
"There is no harm," said Minister of Food, Agriculture and Animalism Faruk Çelik and Customs and Trade Minister Bkent Tüfenkci, following rumors that there will be a "raise in bread" earlier in the new year, especially in December.
However, in the capital city of Ankara, 250 grams of bread was sold yesterday at $1.
"The decision for the tariff two years ago began to be carried out," said Halil Ibrahim Balcı, president of the Federation of Turkey's Bakers for a 25-cent raise on the bread.
"This was a tariff issued two years ago."
The Trade Rooms Association set this schedule two years ago.
It's a price applied throughout Turkey.
So there's been a new raise, no price hikes.
But in some areas in Ankara, because of competition, the tradesman sold for 75 cents.
In some areas, it was already sold for $1.
The shopkeeper who trusted his counter, his bread, didn't lower his price, so they have to apply $1 due to competition.
There's no increase or raise.
They're putting in an unpaid price.
"In the first half of 2016, the kilogram price of bread will definitely not exceed $5, and if we don't have a huge problem, we'll complete the year at this price."
Bread has also been sold for $1.25 in some parts of Istanbul.
Terror got Burkina Faso covered in blood this time.
23 people from 18 different countries lost their lives in the attack, which targeted a luxury hotel in the West African country of Burkina Faso, known to be preferred by foreigners and UN officials.
Al Qaeda's North African branch claimed responsibility for the attack.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after ISIS launched a terrorist attack in Jakarta, the largest Muslim country in the world, with 250 million inhabitants.
A Canadian and an Indonesian lost their lives in a day-long bombing and armed attack on a Starbucks branch and police station on a busy street of foreign embassies, luxury hotels and shops.
Indonesian officials say the attackers were inspired by the November 13th Paris massacre.
Frank Garner, a security reporter for British BBC television, noted that this action has recently been part of a frightening tendency to show itself in many cities around the world.
The United States was recently hurt by acts of terrorism.
At the beginning of last December, 14 people were killed in an armed attack launched by an ISIS sympathiser couple in San Bernardino, California, United States.
'San Bernardino' attack that rocked the U.S.
"We have had two major attacks in Paris," German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere reminded of terrorist attacks in many parts of the world following a live bomb attack on 10 German tourists in Sultanahmet.
If we say that, then terror will have won...
We used the phrase "no step back."
ISIS has left Whatsapp to speak with Alrawi app
According to a new report, the terrorist organisation uses its own chat vehicle to communicate independently from talk practices such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegraph.
According to Defense One's report, the organisation is taking advantage of a new texting application to communicate between itself.
This android app called "Alrawi" is being distributed and uploaded through an APK file.
The application allows the organisation to communicate in code among itself and share media.
ISIS's flash move in Iraq
The functionality of the application, according to the Ghost Security Group, is "first" to popular applications such as WhatsApp and Telegraph.
How powerful the encryption used is is unknown for the time being.
ISIS had previously carried out all communication through the Telegram application, which allowed it to send a message through the encrypted link.
However, the Telegraph revealed the channels of ISIS members.
Moreover, the U.S. government demands that the practice developers place back doors to its applications.
So instead of relying on WhatsApp and Telegram's encryption, the organisation is now using its own solutions.
UAAA: Iran is a nuclear satellite to the agreement
Speaking at a press conference in Vienna, Kerry said Iran has fulfilled its part of the nuclear agreement and has officially lifted economic sanctions against Iran: the International Atomic Energy Agency (UAEA) has announced that Iran has fulfilled the necessary commitments under the nuclear agreement.
Iranian President Hasan Ruhani, in a message from Twitter to the people of Iran, announced that he congratulated the removal of post-nuclear sanctions signed by six world countries and Tehran.

How should a semester's holiday be assessed?
We asked Murat Aydın, a teacher-student coach, how should students evaluate their semester vacation?
A semester's holiday should not only be thought of as rest, entertainment, time at the head of television and computer.
Mid-year vacation is an important opportunity to prepare for a new education period and to review the past.
The term "empty time" is also an important opportunity for personality development, knowledge, skill, and hobbies.
Make a semi-year evaluation list.
Write down everything you're going to do, everything you've planned, and try to apply it.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and have a very productive semester.
Now let's talk about what should be a productive semester for fellow students who prepare for YGS-LYS in the first place.
Because the questions we get from friends who are preparing for YGS-LYS exams are, "How should we evaluate this period, do we have to do a lot of questions, or do we have to deal with them?"
To respond to them and to have a productive period, let us first enter our writing with advice from fellow students who are preparing for the exam.
The preparation for the exam should be a process starting from the ninth grade under normal conditions, but we're trying to complete it more in the last year, which forces us to spend the last year more effective, more efficient, and more accurate.
The senior will also have to conduct the school's written work together as well as the preparation for the exam.
Even though the graduate student who completed the school took the examination (YGS-LYS) at least once and experienced it, the year he will be re-prepared as a graduate student is critical for him as well.
Because most graduate students and their parents see the year as their last chance, and that creates greater stress.
Studying is a study that the student does because he doesn't enjoy it, just because he feels compelled, and therefore he usually leaves it at the end, but for students who do it regularly, make it a habit, it's a complete task, and it's always part of a plan when to do it.
Now it's next semester, and we have to make the most of it.
And for that, we must have a plan that allows us to manage time well.
Study for Part-Year Holiday:
Everyone has to make a plan in their own way first.
What's been done, what's missing, is to plan the day, the week, and the 15 days.
During this period, there must be reoccurrences and question solutions.
At the same time, students who do not lack much can also take an average test or two.
Resolve Your Missing Subjects: Studies show that people forget 75 percent of what they learn in one week, 66 percent in one day, 54 percent in one hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetting is to repeat it.
Students who have made too many mistakes in the past in particular should focus on their overall reworks.
First, identify your missing issues and plan them day by day, set a topic every day, and make sure that they are dealt with.
This plan will relieve you both academically and psychologically.
Note that when you place matters in your plan, you make the most mistakes.
Because in the future, you won't have a vacation this long.
Do Question Solutions:
It's as important to solve questions as it is to repeat them.
Because we can only see how much we understand the work we're doing through the question we've solved.
Don't forget to put a certain number of question solutions each day.
The number of questions you will be able to solve may vary depending on your work that day; you may not be able to solve a lot of questions on a day of weighty study, but we need to do at least a certain amount of problem-solving to see how much we have learned about that day.
Solve Tests:
Another study you'll be doing on your half-year vacation should be studying for test exams.
Even though all matters are not finished, you can at least do the study-test solutions.
Let's say you've done a lot of Turkish lessons; you can solve the trials of Turkish courses prepared for 40 questions.
And make sure you work on that.
If you can solve 40 Turkish questions in 60 minutes at first, your next goal is to be able to solve them in a few minutes, if possible.
Holiday and Hobby Plan:
Holidays, of course, do not just mean studying; you must devote a few days to vacation, rest, and hobbies.
A vacation period of studying alone will prevent you from discharging and resting.
Therefore, there must be special times for you to make your own plans.
Reading books, watching TV, surfing on the Internet can be one of your plans, and most importantly, how much time you're going to spend.
And a little advice for friends who said they didn't have a productive first term.
If you're saying my first term didn't go very well, I didn't work very well, and I don't have a lot to spare, this semester vacation is a great opportunity for you, too.
But first you have to decide and believe it.
During the 2009-2010 season in Turkey's football league, goals were scored between 76th and 90th minutes at the most.
Now, you answer the question you asked yourself, the game's over, and you're going to the locker room, or the game's still going on, and you've got a lot of minutes to score?
I guess no one wants to say, "Now we're going to look at the next game," which is a classic comment used by a defeated football team teacher or his players.
Now all you have to do is let go of the past and look in front of you, not run.
To put it all together:
1) First of all, plan a semester vacation,
2) Do it again by going over what you know,
3) Take care of the missing issues,
4) Work out the issues by solving questions,
5) Solve test exams,
6) Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new era
8) Take time for yourself, hobbies, and pleasures,
9) Make time for family and friends,
10) Take time for social and cultural activities (series, sports, theatre, concert, travel, picnic, etc.)
'Kervan' has gone on a long journey.
Chinasi Demirel, the founder of Kervan, one of Turkey's largest 'home' store chains, and his son Hasan, each with an average of 1,000 square metres, included home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores in the country and 25 in the country.
With recently completed trade records, the caravan also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
"We are now going to continue to become smaller stores with the Kervan, with the Great Store, with the Home Sweet Home," said Shinasi Demirel, who said there is still no caravan store abroad.
"Kervan will also open abroad," he said.
A retail chain of $140m, produced and produced, was created by the merger of home sweet home, which is $50m in the 2015 turnover, and kervan, which is $90m.
The total sales area of the caravan is 45 square feet [45 m] in 35 provinces.
25 of the stores are owned by the parent company.
The caravan has employment for about 500 people.
Home Sweet Home owns 17 stores in the country, 25 across the country, totaling 6,500 square metres, and the number of employees is 320.
"We are mardinian and we entered this sector in 1998," said Kadir Kalaycıoglu, president of the Home Sweet Home Board, who is producing, exporting and store-making with his partner, Al-Karajcioğlu, who said they were very happy with the merger with Kervan.
From the beginning, we'd be a brand with the support of the Shinasi Gentlemen.
Mr. Shinasi is the 'TRT' of this sector.
We learned a lot from him, too.
We even started our first step into the department store when he gave us the White Center.
The caravan and I were already working as strategic partners, not as rivals.
"Now with this merger, there will be a very serious synergy."
Kalaycıoğlu announced that the Home Sweet Home currently has 17 stores abroad, weighing on the Middle East, starting exports to China last month.
"We also opened our first corner in Shanghai."
We agreed on a 200-store chain.
"From now on, we're going to develop the department store abroad as a caravan with Home Sweet Home."
Poroshenko sells his factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed Liga.net news website on the issue, said the factory was set up for $200m.
Moskalevsky said, "Yes, we've put the factory on the market."
"As soon as we put it on sale, all the real buyers disappeared," he said, adding that there was no buyer.
"We have set about $200m," Moskalevsky said about the price of the company's factory in Lipetsk, Russia.
Roshen, one of the world's largest producers and Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, produces 450 thousand tons of chocolate and candy a year.
Star Holdings became the Pladis abroad
The Star Holdings merged global companies that operate in the biscuits and chocolate sectors they bought under the name "Pladis."
The merger, which brought together De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Pleiades, was born with a new $5.2 billion food giant working for 26,000 people.
"Being a global company was our goal from the very beginning," said Yildiz Holding Board Chairman Murat Ulir at a meeting on the merger of global companies within Star Holding.
Murat Ulır released the $335m sale live from Periscope
This company, founded 72 years ago, is now moving to become a global company in the world called Star Enterprises, in the business of biscuit chocolate candy.
During that time, we developed from retail to ambalage, in personal care and in various industrial branches along with the biscuit chocolate candy.
77 factories operating in 14 countries, 300 brands, and we're at thousands of sales points.
"The more we look at the possibilities in our family now, " he said, "we want to go back and focus on our cookie chocolate candy -- our main job -- and we want to be global in this field; we're reorganizing for this," he said, adding that the entire Star Holdings is a family of over 50,000 people.
The life story of Mr. Sabri, the father of Pleiades
We're reevaluating our company structure, we're reorganizing.
We've divided the world into regions.
And we've divided these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Mohammed and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tobaccocü is responsible for Turkey's Middle East, K.Africa and Turki Republics.
Mohamed Elsarky is responsible for our global Godiva work, as well as the continent of America and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be in charge of England, continent Europe and Africa.
As I call it a quality and innovation guru, Ali Ulir will take on global responsibility in his territory, while Cem Karakaş will assist me in managing the business.
China, Russia, partly South East Asia, will be the new and improved areas that we're going to build and develop.
Murat Ulır sold shares in SAF Gyo
"We promise happiness to the world in every bite," he said. "The name of our global firm that we built to make it happen is Pladis."
He said, "Where did you invent the Pladis, it doesn't really mean anything in particular," and added:
The Aztecs call it Maya.
The Japanese are Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, we were inspired by the name of the Pleiades constellation, which consists of seven stars of Latin meaning Pleiades.
So, in some ways, we translated the Pleiades into globala.
Star Holdings Executive Board Vice President Ali Ulir stressed that by co-operating with labs in different countries, "we began to create synergy in innovation" and added:
We've got some very valuable RD teams, and we've gathered these teams together, and so far we've had certain synergys working on an RD platform.
We have 27 RD centers under the Pladis.
The biggest of them are in Turkey and England.
We have over 300 RD specialists working here.
Synergy studies are already paying off.
The digestives (Nibbles) Draje (Nibbles) is produced in the chocolate factory in Silivri, which is produced in Nibbles, which is to be exported to England.
Another example of synergy: brands are different, but products are the same.
We soon adapted a cracker technology that had been developed in England, Jacob's Crisplys, to Turkey, and gave a good taste to our country under the name Pleiades Krispi Scratchy.
Laviva, whom we all know so well, met consumers in America today.
Call of Duty is over 250 million.
This series of acts, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games, carved in gold letters in the game world, seems to be memorable for many years.
In particular, the newly announced sales numbers prove how legendary we should find them.
Activision, which holds the license rights of the series, showed 250 million copies of its private number of sales by the end of the year.
At the beginning of last year, the company, which shared the sales of the entire series, has since managed to sell 75 million Call of Duty games.
And a lot of that is, of course, the Black Ops 3 game, so we wouldn't be wrong.
Kemal Kilicdaroğlu has been elected President once again
Kemal Kilicdaroğlu has been re-elected as chairman of the General Assembly.
Kilicdaroglu, who received 990 votes from the 1,238 delegates who voted, was the new president.
248 of the votes used were invalidated.
After the result was announced, the party members showed joy.
The CHP had a total of 1,275 delegates.
The convention completed its work to meet at 10 p.m. on Sunday.
Kilicdaroğlu briefly said:
We'd like to play games here, sing songs.
But the point we're coming from is not good.
There's an unmanageable reality of Turkey.
The atmosphere is clouding all of this.
The pessimist painting is caused by those who rule the country.
As CHP people, we're against terror no matter where it comes from, no matter how it comes from.
Terror is a crime of humanity, and terrorists must never be forgiven.
The fight against terror is done with reason, with knowledge, with wisdom.
Of course we want to fight, so no one gets a nosebleed.
What's the difference between the photos in Syria and Lebanon, the photos in Southeast?
When they sat down at the table, they made some serious mistakes.
It is the power that is responsible for blood, for tears, for all those who die.
In 2002, they took over the country with zero terrors, and today there's a Turkey turning into a bloodbath.
Who's responsible for all this?
The taxi driver in Diyarbakir?
What's he paying for, Turkey?
We're going to attend meetings, and we're going to convey our thoughts, sincerely, about changing the laws of coup.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone's personal views.
I say, "Let's change the coup d'état."
The intellectuals of this country are being raided and taken into custody at the crack of dawn because they have expressed their thoughts.
There are parts of us that we disagree with, but people have to be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictator says, "Eat the state's bread and turn against the state."
I'd like to ask him, why didn't those who ate the state's bread and took advantage of all the resources of the state rob the state while they didn't?
CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We will all prepare for the fourth great revolution.
No matter what the cost, we will bring liberal democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, take us into custody, whatever they do, whatever the cost, the CHP will bring freedom to this country.
I'm calling you loud and clear, Davutoglu.
Don't hide behind the coup law, the man hiding behind the coup d'état is not out of his head.
You gave the man who gave you the award of the highest service medal.
What blow are you talking about?
He's completely deluded by the public.
The party's officials ranked the other three revolutions: ending the reign of the first major revolution and establishing the Republic; going from one-party period to multi-party period during the Second Great Revolution; transitioning to social democracy with Bulent Ecevit in the Third Revolution.
They have presidential qualifications, duties.
Article 103 is the president's oath.
We know how important the concept of honor and honor is in this society.
If a person comes out and makes that promise, he'll do it to the death.
Because honor and honor cannot be discussed for us.
What does honor and honor mean to you, the man with the dictatorship?
What do you know about honor and honor, and why did you make that oath?
What does honor and honor mean to you?
That's what I want to know.
In a religious man, the concept of honor and honor is the crown of honor.
Their intention is not to lift the coup law, but to enforce the coup law.
Not enough. They want the presidential system.
How's the presidential system with the boss?
Why are you rejecting the Ottoman parliamentary system?
Anyone who commands will do their job.
Does the parliamentary worker work well in Turkey?
No, it doesn't.
If we bring in the liberal democracy, the system will work.
They call it a coup, but they've strengthened the coup law.
As Izmir MP Mustafa Balbay announced his candidacy for the presidency, he failed to enter the race because he failed to collect the signatures of 128 delegates needed for the nomination.
"I can't run under current circumstances," Balbay, who can get 92 signatures, said.
The parliamentary assembly (PM), the central executive board (MYK) and the members of the honor board were separated, while former CHP Leader Deniz Baykal sat in the stands with the party members.
Stanbul MP Gulay Absponsive sat next to the place that left for MPs, instead of sitting at the place where he arrived early and left for President-General Kilicdaroglu.
The meeting of Yalova MP Muharrem İnce with Kilicdaroglu was one of the issues discussed in the Kurultai lobby.
He explained that he had been offered a PM membership and that he had not accepted it himself.
Central sources, however, have claimed that the request for a meeting came from Fine and that it was not recommended for PM membership.
"No one has shared this general source, the content of this meeting with Istanbul MP Ali Özcan," he said on Twitter.
And Özcan said, "How can I know about two people seeing each other?"
He just said, "She's gone and she's seen him."
Kilicdaroglu often applauded the b-press.
On the first day of the usual "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Congress," the party council (PM) has branded its lobby.
After the convention talk, Kilicdaroglu went home to work for the PM list.
In compiling the 100-member key list of Kilicdaroglu, the current MYK members found out that Yakup Akkaya, who did not want to be in charge of the PM, said he would phone 13 other members except Ercan Karakaş and PM, who had once again been nominated for the nomination, Seyhan Erdoğdu.
Kilicdaroglu may also be able to point to another list of 100-person PM keys, as well as to another narrowed list of keys.
The 21-point result declaration adopted unanimously in the CHP Assembly demanded that the removal of the provisions of the European Convention on Local Administration, which was brought up by the DTK's autonomy debates, increase the share of power in the local region.
The declaration also included "the end of the party state order" and "the establishment of a transparent and accountable state of law."
Vice President Selçuk Özdağ of the Kurultay EC Party, İdris Baluken of the HDP, followed by Ruzar Demirel of the MPP.
The EC Party's Özdağ and the EC Party's delegation left the hall after Kilicdaroglu strongly criticised President Erdogan.
"I saw that he was losing his review dose, and I couldn't possibly accept it," he said.
In the courtroom, arrested journalists Can Dündar and Erdem Gül's photos were noted by the sign written "If you don't burn, how will the darkness come out if I don't?" and the sign "Peace" in Kurdish, Turkish and English.
The convention began in the early hours of the morning with Group Comments and Ahmet Kaya songs.
Diyarbakir Bar President Tahir Elçi's wife, Türkan Elçi, who died in an armed attack, received a message from the assembly.
His mother, Gülsum, and his father, Sami Elvan, attended the convention.
It was the most applauded part of the talk that he said that they would embrace democracy "death" no matter what price it took to pay.
So far, the CHP, which has collected 52 regular, 18 extraordinary conventions, has gathered its 53rd largest convention at the Ankara Arena yesterday.
The turnout was high.
There were over 15,000 CHPs in the 12,000-seat hall.
However, the crowd did not have the enthusiasm they deserved.
The most exciting moment was when Kilicdaroglu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu.
The excitement continued while the couple greeted the hall.
There was no discipline in the hall at the AK Party convention.
Even as Kılıçdaroglu spoke, there was great activity in the field area of Arena.
Obviously, CHPs, party managers and journalists who wanted to enter the Party Assembly preferred to seek support by telling them themselves.
"It's better than having extra party members like Korea or the party meetings in the Soviet Union to sit still, like a rope," said a CHP director, explaining that it is not a bad thing.
The CHP convention differs from the AK Party or the MHP convention.
Only the presidents speak at these parties.
In CHP, the convention becomes a platform where party problems are also discussed.
When there were too many party members who wanted to talk at the convention yesterday, Court President Murat Karayalçın had trouble setting the deadline.
While there was a phrase in faces and languages that said, "The country is going bad," there was a distance from the comments, "You can change the course with the painting that comes out of this room."
There was no consistent and strong response to the question, "What to do," even though all CHP members said, "What to do."
The fact that there will be no choice in the next four years has had a profound effect.
When Kilicdaroglu was on the stand, we were waiting for the journalists to answer the question, "What to do."
Kılıçdaroğlu answered the question "What's going on" first.
He pointed out the issue of arrested journalists, what had been done to academics because of the declaration, what had happened in the Southeast, the deadlock of foreign policy.
He has long responded to the "Anadolu myths" about CHP's party, such as "the non-religious party," "supporting the violence," "the party of the elite."
And as for the "what to do" phase, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to bring up "strategy."
He stressed that more justice can be overcome by stronger democracy.
He also made a promise on behalf of CHP and said, "We will work at any cost until we bring the democracy."
"We will fight to the death for democracy," he said.
A final note should also be reminded that the CHP has taken care of the "organisation" issue as part of the 53rd convention, and is now able to collect a smooth convention.
Meanwhile, there was a card issued for 900 journalists who were supposed to follow the convention, but journalist participation in the hall was not at that level.
The representatives of media organisations in Ankara were not as eager to follow the convention as the EC Party's conventions were.
Self-governance was requested for life
3 of whom were arrested by Diyarbakır Chief Public Prosecutor's Office have been taken into custody by the 4th High Criminal Court.
Following instructions and calls from the top executives of the PKK/KCK terrorist organisation, the indictment said that statements have been made under the name of "privatisation" in some districts and districts of Diyarbakır, İstanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Mardin, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağrı.
The indictment, which has been said to have called for illegal action by the leaders of the organisation and the youth and women's structures, noted an increase in Diyarbakır's attacks on security forces, public institutions and organisations, citizens' homes, workplaces and vehicles, and long-barreled weapons and rocket-gun attacks in the districts of Sur, Binlar, Silvan, Bismil, lice, Dicle and Hazro.
Anti-Islamics clash with ISIS. Our outpost has been shot.
The recent conflicts between Syria's Düden, Kara Mezra Büğüddin, and ISIS in Black Bridge village against the Yavuzlu village of Kilis continue to escalate in recent days.
The sound of weapons and mortars fired during the conflict between ISIS and opponents at a close point near the border is also heard by Turkey.
Smoke rising from areas of frequent explosions has been seen by Turkey's naked eye, while security forces on the border have taken heavy precautions with armored vehicles.
At the same time, a harassment shot was fired at the Martyr Mehmet Border Station near Yavuzlu village of Kilis, from the village of Cüğddin, under the control of ISIS militants.
As part of the rules of engagement, the soldiers responded with weapons and obsessors in the area of the harassment fire.
Russian fighter planes allegedly launched an attack on Hameme village 17km from Turkey's border.
Six Syrians injured in the air bombing were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
The lotto rich people got their checks.
The Robinson couple, who live in a small house worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, chose to receive a single payment of $328 million (about $1 billion) rather than a total of $528.8.8 million (1.6 billion Tl) over a period of 29 years.
"After all, there are no guarantees for tomorrow," the couple said.
John Robinson, working in a chain of stores, and his wife Lisa, who works as an assistant with a dermatologist, said they'd be in charge on Monday, even though they were millionaires.
The couple aims primarily to pay off their mortgage debt and help their relatives with the money they earn.
It was announced that the jackpot was divided into threes.
iOS9: how to buy new iPhone operating system, Apple update published
By going to Settings for the new operating system, you can touch "Genele" and choose "Writing Update."
When you're ready, your phone will give you the option to download and install.
Some users had a problem following this installation and received an error message saying, "Writing update failed."
To overcome this problem, users are advised to expect a reduction in the system or to try and upgrade the iTunes from there.
The phone will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may also be deleting applications to make room -- but Apple minimized the upgrade, preventing it from happening, and recommending some applications to erase it, using a special tool for the reconstruction when the process is over.
It's worth making sure your phone is charged or next to a charger so your battery doesn't run out while you're upgrading.
If the charge is too low, Apple won't allow updates, because the phone can stop at half the time to stop the update.

FedEx's income is mixed, financial outlook will drop in 2016
FedEx has reported disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has reduced its profit forecast all year, due to a reduction in demand for cargo services and increased costs in ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 season workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx announced he was going to hire 50,000 seasons of workers for the holidays.
About 2.5% dropped in pre-opening procedures about 45 minutes before the opening gong on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said that between $10.40 and $10.90 per fiscal year, which will end next May, is expected to be less than 20 cents per previous estimate.
Analysts expected $10.84 based on a study by the FactSet.
Despite the average increase of 4.9%, which will be valid on January 4th and the high rate of reduction in heavy or large shipments of heavy packages will begin in November.
According to the company, costs cuts are still expected to be higher than the previous year, with higher incomes and e-trade growth.
President and CEO Fred Smith said the company "perceived a solid performance, especially in production and global trade, despite the expected economic conditions."
The holiday employment plans were announced a day after the rival company UPS, which says UPS plans to purchase 90,000 to 95,000 extra workers, the same number as last year.
During the three-month period, which ended on August 31st, FedEx increased its income by 6% from the previous year, making $692 million.
The winning per share was at $2.42, behind the estimates of 12 analysts discussed by Zacks Investment Research.
The revenue has increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts interviewed by Zacks were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx took a hit last year from a setback in international priority transport, causing the revenue to slow down in the Express unit.
However, the explosion in online shopping raised the results of FedEx Ground Services.
In the last quarter, land services revenue has increased by 29%, but business revenue has been basically stagnant due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
As revenues fell in the cargo business at high labour costs, the express unit saw high income due to high base rates.
In pre-opening operations about an hour before the opening gong, FedEx stocks dropped to $150.15 at $3.85 or 2.5% down.
They closed Tuesday at 11% for the year and 17% lower to the record level on June 11th.
In its most anticipated meetings over the years, Federal Reserve politicians spent two days around a 27-foot Honduran mahogany table this week, deciding whether it's time to increase interest rates almost ten years or more.
The two-story conference room on one wing of the central bank will be a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that Women's President Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues have put the nation's economic interests above everything else.
The central bank has two tasks from Congress: to raise US employment to the highest level and to stabilize prices here.
However, since the Great Depression, Fed leaders have acknowledged that there is a third non-written power of attorney: financial balance.
And this third power of attorney may be the X factor in a decision that is too close to predicting whether the U.S. economy, which will be announced on Thursday, is ready to begin cutting off its unique stimulus support from a short-term interest rate that has been going on since late 2008.
Although most data shows that the economy is growing firmly, the latest turmoil in global financial markets can already make Fed officers nervous about adding vulnerability by increasing reference federal funding interest at less than a quarter of a percent.
"The labour market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they will watch," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist of Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they're looking for an excuse not to increase the rate, the growing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer," he said.
Fed has no idea what he's going to do, and it's causing fluctuations in his financial markets.
Half the economists Bloomberg recently interviewed were expecting an interest increase this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to stand by with the main indicator, which shows only the possibility of an increase of about 30%.
This could point to a decline in the stock market if the Fed doesn't ease its impact by promising another increase could be on its way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial index average rose to 16,599.85 with an increase of 228.89 points or 1.4%.
"The proportion of the more Fed policy makers has been triggered by the expectation that they will keep it stable this week," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It'd be amazing if Fed could raise the odds right now," he said.
If Fed executives had made that decision, "they would have had to take a long time to calm the financial markets so they wouldn't panic."
Other experts have suggested that an increase in rate could calm the financial markets, as the smoke screen is lifted as to when the Fed will take action.
Just a month ago, Fed, this month's rate seemed to be on the road to increasing 0.25 percent, a small step that would strengthen the recovery of the United States in the process of slowly reducing money conditions.
Although liberals complain about the need for a more economic process, this year's rate increase is expected in spring and early summer, Yellen said.
Although the work creation rate declined in August, growth in the labour market was stable this year.
Last month, unemployment fell to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years, and it approached the level of full employment the Fed counted.
Pay hikes showed signs of improvement.
And while inflation continues to follow below the central bank's 2% annual goal, Fed politicians say the temporary impact of sharply diminishing oil prices is an important reason.
"The economy can handle higher rates, and despite the shortage of labour markets, it needs it," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon macroeconomics.
However, the financial markets around the world began to shake after China went into devaluation in the currency at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones industrial index average went down 16% of the May record level because investors feared a slowing Chinese economy would bring down global growth.
When the market was now nearly 10% below Dow's high level in May, it somehow jumped back.
For Fed policymakers, market turmoil makes it even more complicated to calculate the time when the interest rate will be increased.
"In the past few weeks, the financial markets in China have not been known to be the most in the financial markets, and they may have been a little narrowed down by the lack of news on economic weakening," said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior research partner at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate.
Now he's predicting they'll wait at least another month to manage these effects better.
"There's a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts of the U.S. economy will be and they have almost no data to rely on further development in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the Fed's primary concerns, so technically there should be no factor in the process of landing.
But in reality, Fed has become the financial authority of the world.
The impact of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could "remove" the financial expansion triggered by worldwide market tremors.
In a world where markets and economies are more and more intertwined, Fed officials are expected not only to monitor developments elsewhere but also to consult other central bank managers and experts to better read the global economy.
Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at the property management firm Envestnet Inc., said the decision-making process was "a skill rather than science."
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va. President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "The Fed has overreacted in the past to apparent financial market movements associated with economic fundamentals."
Lacker, a member of the policy-maker Federal Open Market Committee with the right to vote and pressured to increase odds, cited 1998-99 decisions, for example.
"Despite limited identifiable recommendations for US growth," he said, "the financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to cut 0.75 per cent during three meetings."
A year later, Fed officials took these cuts back.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the British Central Bank's rating committee, said "The Fed should put financial balance concerns first only during major crises, as in the 2008 market meltdown."
He said the last disturbance doesn't come close to this level.
Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for Economics, said you don't really want to be afraid of going to a rate increase because the markets are upset.
The Central Bank's Law still has two powers, and it doesn't mention financial balance, and I don't think they should make that move until that changes.
You want a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, Chinatown.
The market/depo opened in 1997 and belonged to L.A.X-C.
The L.A.X.C., often referred to as Thai Costco, is a wholesale Thai market that sells to the public.
Yeah, it's Chinatown, not Taiwan.
Sunday/depo is a one-stop shop; it sells numerous fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Asian and Thai snacks, kitchen items, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even an automotive part if you want to buy motor oil.
The store is huge, and it could take an hour to get through all the corridors.
If you get hungry in all this shopping, grab food from LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior of the store is next to the good, calculated boxes, and there are various ways of getting them out.
What's he stockpiling: you want something from Thailand?
It's probably in LAX-C.
The products are reasonably priced and some are sold collectively.
Fresh products include special Asian and regional Thai spices, fruits and so on.
The meat shelf is very extensive, and so is the fish -- the workers behind the counter clean the fish and make fillet, and they even fry it if you want.
Most of the store has frozen curry leaves, bitter melons and galangal, where you can find all ducks, fish, veal blood, fish balls, regional sausages, commercial foods and more.
Who shops: restaurant owners and cooks, families and individuals.
The wide corridors include shopping carts and forklifts.
Found right next to the fresh monthong durian exit stand.
Where is it: between Chinatown and downtown, in the industrial department of Los Angeles, just a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Park: LAX-C has its own parking space, shares it with other stores and restaurants.
Although the store is very busy, parking is usually not hard to find.
Brazil's Rio Grande Pedes Society encourages healthy nutrition during breastfeeding
Brazil's peds organization SPRS resorted to a shocking method of testing images of milk children depicting unhealthy nutrition to explain the importance of feeding women during breast-feeding.
Human milk is made up of many forms of protein, fat, vitamins, and carbohydrate, which provides babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intakes around 500 calories due to their energy surplus requirements.
According to recent research, however, the food supplements that mothers should receive are not limited to calories.
According to a new study led by Texas Baylor Medical College Professor Robert Waterland, the healthy diet of pregnant women affected the genetic expression of their babies and protected them from tumor development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy food has been found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Seven's Sunrise continues to dominate the ratings despite Nine's efforts to take the lead on the Today Show.
The moves Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson made to Canberra to overthrow Liberal's leadership failed to achieve a ratings increase for Today.
After Tony Abbott's Malcolm Turnbull crash, Granny's breakfast show was staged in the national capital.
Rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Army in London, is trapped in the weekly international series, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The distance problem doesn't seem to make much difference for Australian viewers, and today has an average of 3397,000 viewers in five capitals for the number 339.000.
Today averaged a slight increase in ratings compared to last Tuesday (317,000), but the number was still behind last Thursday (33,000).
Today's been catching up with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Sunrise averaged 318,000 for 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
By September today, the Sunrise averages 349.000 for today's 314,000.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change affect the people this morning more than the parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for asking!

The big news for Seven was the breathtaking beginning of 800 words from Erik Thomson, the star of the old Packed to the Rafters.
The new drama about a newly widowed father deciding to move to the seaside with his two children in New Zealand has reached a very impressive average of 1,219 million.
Critics questioned if Thomson could run a solo show without Rafters' star, Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's result was a ringing yes.
Seven's X Factor protected its power with 1,136 million viewers, Block (838,000) and TBL (726,000) easily defeated their families.
Seven confused his night fortunes with two Chase-Australia.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half hour of the new information competition (17:00-17:30) averaged 446,000 viewers.
In the second half hour (17:30-18:00) the number jumped to 6233,000 viewers - enough for a small win against Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat (613.000).
Monday Night's first half hour of Pursuit-Australia averaged 250,000 viewers, while in the second half hour the figure rose to 750,000.
The Hot Seat had an average of 620,000.
The follow-up of Australia's second-night ratings led Nine to believe that the Hot Seat would prevail at 5:30 p.m.
Following was a change in the million-dollar minute that didn't sink into McGuire's show.
It was originally published as "Sunrise prevails as long as Today stays local."
The last three people left think that single Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Is the secret out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markki may have found out who will win the bachelor without realizing it.
At the end of Sam Wood's Single Show, the woman he was going to choose was in complete secrecy.
And the other three girls are doing their best not to tell us who bought the last rose.
But if we check Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markki the day before three people fell in two, they might have given us a clue as to who the winner would be.
Sam Wood sealed his mouth until Thursday's final.
In a lyrical language, all three women explained why Wood was perfect and why they wanted to be his partner by stressing his sense of humor, ambition, family values, and positive attitude.
But if it's not you, their answer to the question of who should have Wood's last rose may contain information about who will win the heart of The Bachelor.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markski quickly named him Mackay as the best candidate for Wood except themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been pretty close since day one.
Jeavons-Fellows said: "From the moment I came home, by reading (Sarah's) energy and Sam's energy, I felt that they were right for each other, and that's what I thought throughout the program."
Markki added: "Sarah is very practical, it's fun to be around her."
I saw them together, and there's chemistry between them.
They feel so good and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood are going to be a very good couple.
Mackay said last week's house-visiting appointments made Wood think he was the one.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized it wasn't exactly just a game -- I'm completely committed to him now."
When asked who Wood could choose without him, he was mysterious.
He said, "I don't know if I can say that."
"I love other girls equally - Snezana and Lana are equal."
The Bachelor airs on Ten at 7:30 Wednesday.
Is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Haynes had several options in terms of where he would start his NFL career.
After Detroit and Seattle moved to the U.S., they were very interested in him, and after last year's impressive open practice day, many other teams approached him.
But Haynes chose the San Francisco 49ers and his coach, Jim Tomsula, and that seems to be a very wise decision.
Some coaches benched Hayne for losing her performance in the Australian rugby league, as in Tuesday's 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed this man and gave Haynes another chance to play in a play after Reggie Bush's injury.
After the game, Tomsula continued to show her true colors to the dressing room.
Instead of insulting the rookies in front of the whole team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Haynes at the post-game press conference.
49ers correspondent Cam Inman said that Haynes also took courage from special team co-ordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget this fall and consider the next game.
Jarryd Haynes made the Minnesota Vikings score in the first quarter and dropped the ball.
This wasn't what Haynes and his large Australian fans dreamed of for their first game at the NFL.
Hayne was seen swearing on her way out of the field after she dropped the ball, and then told Australian radio duo Hamish and Andy that she couldn't think of a worse start for the NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, "This is just one of those things, and you'll feel sorry for the next game, and that's it."
Hayne also reminded Queensland of its first match of the 2007 Origin with the back pass.
Still, this has been a wonderful experience for the 27-year-old player.
After the game, Haynes released an Instagram shot holding an Australian flag with fans.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint in a passage in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who openly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was imprisoned, seized by oil company Yukis, and his pro-democracy efforts were cut short.
4 People Killed in Nepal as a result of Police Shoot Plastic Bullets to Protesters
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed as police fired plastic bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution in the country, an official reported on Wednesday.
The incident took place Tuesday evening in Rupandehi, 175 miles west of Katmandu, the capital.
County chief official Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said that from 1,000 to 1,000 protestors gathered outside a police station and some threw stones and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper spray and fired into the air before using plastic bullets.
He said 20 cops and five civilians were injured.
It's not clear why plastic bullets used as a known but generally less lethal alternative result in such a high mortality case.
The conflict was the last of the violent protests that have been going on across Nepal's southern plains for weeks, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group argue that the new constitution will dilute their political influence.
The ethnic Tharus group, which wants to form their own state, is also protesting in western Nepal.
At least 40 people died, 11 of them being police officers, in violent conflicts that have been going on since August 10th.
At this time, four major political parties agreed to divide the country into regions -- an important but creative step towards drafting a new constitution in Nepal, which has been run by the central state for centuries.
Studies on a new constitution have been under way since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Lawmakers worked on draft constitutional provisions in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new text will be organised by Sunday.
NHC says there's a 60 percent chance of hurricanes south of Cape Verde Islands.
On Tuesday, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said a large low pressure system, some 350 miles south of the Cape Verde Islands, is 60 per cent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low-pressure system was seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Small Antilles, and the Miami-based weather forecasting centre said there is a 60 percent chance of a tropical hurricane happening within the next two days.
Google launches a fundraiser campaign to raise 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a fundraising campaign aimed at raising $11m for humanitarian organisations that have helped thousands of refugees to Europe by fleeing countries that have suffered from war and have become poor.
Google has announced on its blog an unexpected personal approach to donating.
Instead of a manager making that statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who ran away from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote her own personal experience.
"There was hunger, thirst, cold and fear in our journey, as well as many dark buses and train journeys," he wrote.
I was lucky.
But because the refugee and immigrant crisis in Europe is growing, many families like my family need help.
The donations will go to four non-profit organisations that offer aid to refugees and immigrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Rescue of Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the first $5.5m donation to Google.com/refugeerlief until it collected $11 million.
Europe has faced the worst refugee crisis since World War II, and the biggest reason for this is the four-year Syrian civil war that has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
He is also on the run from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya, damaged by many wars.

Weight loss surgery can help patients with moderately obese diabetes.
According to a new study, it could take at least five years for a moderately obese type 2 diabetes patient to benefit from obesity surgery.
But it's still too early to say whether or not they've lived longer than patients who've never had surgical surgery after a moderately obese diabetes surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who wrote an article in the new study on JAMA surgery, who specializes in obesity surgery, "death rates take a long time to manifest themselves."
Weight loss surgeries, a.k.a. bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach diameter.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most of the research has been done on highly obese people with a body mass index (VKI) 35 or more.
BMI, which is measured by the length of weight, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
Over 25 BMIs indicate that people are overweight, while over 30 BMIs are considered obese.
BMI you can calculate from this link: 1sa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In the new study, Taiwan's full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has used data from two types of bariatric surgery -- gastric bypass and tube stomach surgeries -- that have been conducted in treatment of two type 2 diabetic obese patients since 2007.
From the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those operating has been reduced from 31 to 24.5.
In response, BMIs of non-surgery diabetes have remained stable around 29 of them.
Diabetes has been partially resolved in 36% of those operating, and 28% have been partially resolved.
In the medically treated group, diabetes has been partially resolved in only 1% and only 2%.
The authors also stated that blood pressure control, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol were usually better in the "surgery intervention group."
At the same time, researchers have shown the blood levels of A1c hemoglobin that reflect blood sugar in patients over time.
Investigators say it's best to keep the A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
Post-op A1c hemoglobin is down from 9% to about 6%.
In the medical group, it remained stable at around 8%.
But with improved levels of A1c hemoglobin, this better "glysmic control" did not reduce mortality in five years, according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his teammates, who conducted the research.
The research team compared the findings to these two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with the tube stomach surgery, the group lost more weight (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and A1c hemoglobin (3.1% to 2.1%) were seen with higher decreases, and their chances of a complete decline (46.9 to 16.7%).
Dr. Blackstone of Arizona Medical College-Phoenix, although the study did not specify a clear benefit for post-op survival at the end of the fifth year, said that according to a study conducted in more overweight patients in Sweden, it had valid data that the surgery extended its life expectancy.
In this study, the chances of obese patients suffering from bariatric surgery died in 15 years were 29% lower than any other group who had been treated more traditionally.
Although this new study has shown no indication of the benefits of the survival of surgical patients, according to Blackstone, this is reassuring for those who are relevant and under BMI 35.
This is the key part of the article, because BMI says it's safe to operate in a low-level group, no increase in risk of death or renal disorders, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should start taking seriously the issue of gaining weight as the patient's BMI falls below 27 to 30.
I think we've waited long enough for people to take this matter seriously.
I think it's really hard to reverse that after collecting these genetic changes that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - The Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said Europe cannot host all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in refugees' countries.
At the beginning of his 10-day visit to England, the Dalai Lama, who will be working on ethical issues, referred to the ongoing refugee crisis at the opening of the Center for Compassionates in Oxford.
Under the current circumstances, he claimed that mankind's interests should be put first, rather than in the interests of countries or continents.
At the same time, he stressed that the responses of countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis are insufficient.
In his speech, he said, "It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe."
Although he appreciated Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, the Dalai Lama said they were only temporary solutions.
"It's great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but you also have to think about long-term solutions; you have to think about how you can bring permanent peace and permanent development to these Muslim countries through basic education," he stressed.
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never been the solution to problems," he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also mentioned what George Bush did after 9/11 attacks and said that the US violent responses started the chain of uncontrollable events.
In my letter to President Bush following 9/11, I expressed my condolences and expressed that the solution to this problem was nonviolent.
I know his motives are well-intentioned, but he used force and caused unexpected consequences," said the Dalai Lama.
Fourfold increase in child ingestion of hand antiseptics in the last four years.
Poison control centres in the United States have reported an increase of almost 400 per cent in swallowing wet wipes with high levels of alcohol in children under 12 years of age since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of hand-infested swallowing in children under 12 years of age reported to the centre increased from 3,266 cases in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN, "The children have become more popular with such products, and unfortunately, there are percentages of them that will be taken to the emergency room."
He said that some children deliberately drank their hand antiseptics, and others did it to impress their friends or to make a social media claim.
Videos on YouTube show teenagers drinking antiseptic for cheap drunkenness.
Some adolescents reportedly mixed the antiseptic mixture with alcohol-inflicted mouthwaters in order to obtain a stronger drink.
Little boys can smell the antiseptic that appeals to them.
Lopez said, "The kid doesn't think that's a bad thing."
Most of the more attractive ones (el antiseptics) are scented.
There are strawberry, grapes, and orange-flavored hand antiseptics that are extremely attractive to children.
Hand antiseptics contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in little kids, it can only cause a few shots of alcohol poisoning.
According to Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the poisoning center at the University of Kansas Hospital, the Kansas City of Fox 4 tells Fox that "high concentration is alcohol."
You don't leave a few whiskey glasses lying around, but people leave these hand antiseptics out in the open, and that's the easy way for kids to get a lot of alcohol.
Recently, six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who swallowed only four shots of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at his school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
His blood alcohol level was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an ER doctor who took care of him at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, twice the legal alcohol limit accepted in an adult person.
Nhaijah couldn't pronounce the words and couldn't walk when he came into the emergency room.
Rithey reported that because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, the doctors kept her overnight in a separate children's hospital, despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN that it was "too scary."
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or to keep antiseptic handkerchiefs short in contact with skin and put it where children can't reach it.
Other than alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics have been found to be associated with death cases.
In 2013, two Ontario women died from swallowing a hand antiseptic containing an unidentified poison.
Health authorities have suggested that the substance may be methyl alcohol, not ethanol, as indicated on the list of contents.
In January, three fourth-graders from the north of New York, who, according to police reports, conspired to poison their "evil" teachers, "put anti-bacterial products around the classroom."
The teacher banned it from the classroom because it was highly allergic to hand antiseptics.
Police have proposed disciplinary action to the school board, describing this plan as "a wasted attempt."

Let's put our reaction into it.
Let's say, whoring fortune, what a disaster!
Let our humanism grow.
Shame on the stroke.
But he's not fucking ashamed!
Two weeks ago, they killed Miray İnce in Surtown of Şırnak.
He was only three months old.
His grandfather was with him.
They killed him, too.
On January 3rd, they killed Yusef Rainer.
I think he was running from aliens.
They scanned him while he was looking for a safe place.
He had his wife with him.
The day after that, in Diyarbakir, they killed Angel Alpadun at the breakfast table on Small Aktarlı Street.
A day or two later, Sema Çingıllıoğlu burned down the Elementary School.
Two days ago, the same aliens attacked another school filled with firearms and students.
The students have been on the run from side to side.
On 10 January, the bodies of three men who were killed in the attacks of the prostitutes were left at Hazreti Hussein Mosque in Harun Boy neighborhood.
Three children were killed two days ago in Çınar district of Diyarbakır.
An unidentified object killed the lives of these minors with a ton of explosives.
There have been others who have been killed and others who have been injured.
Who's to blame?
Felek, of course.
Bitchy fortune.
No, it's not the bitch.
Motherfucker's innocent!
The killer's out there, waving and smiling at us.
Others are trying to draw attention to themselves.
With the killer right in front of us, instead of pointing at the killer, he's creating opportunities for him to escape.
He's shielding the killer.
He's hiding it.
And after he disappeared, he tells everyone that he didn't actually have anything to do with it.
The sides of the fight we've had over the last 10 years are very clear.
Someone wants to tighten the fire circle around us and set us on fire.
And someone's trying to stop it, and more than that, they're trying to put out the fire around us.
Someone's trying to tear it down, raid it.
Someone's trying to make it, to make it.
There are those who have done all kinds of fighting to us, to our territory.
Civil war.
Interstate war.
The battle of the sects.
The war on power of attorney.
And they have subcontractors.
Dirty terrorist organizations.
Bloody clowns.
Different names, formats.
Turkey has no choice but to fight each one of them.
He's fighting, and that's why he has to deal with the evil of all of them.
Keep fighting until you're sure of your evils...
They took refuge in a white cloth without a skirt for traitors
Terrorist group members of the PKK, which are cornered in the neighborhood, find the solution to blending in with white flags and running away between citizens.
Security forces are implementing GBT to prevent infiltration.
The activist power of the organisation, which has taken a major blow in the countryside and across the border, has also been broken by peace and democracy operations, which began on July 23rd.
According to sources in the region, the heavily hit organisation's weapons and ammunition depot has been seized and neutralized.
Some citizens who have fled PKK attacks from the terrorist organisation are fleeing the point of conflict under police and military control with white flags.
Terrorists trapped between the streets, unable to find an escape route, blended among the citizens and fled with a white flag.
Security units are questioning general information collection (GBT) of persons they suspect.
A PKK terrorist was reportedly involved with the white flag, but was tried to escape when he realized he would be caught during the GBT interrogation.
COMANDOS WILL PRECISE THE COMANDOM
One of the districts that was carefully followed in the region also hit the military and police terrorist organization in Cizre.
Militants nested in the area of Japhes neighborhood, which is said to have been largely cleaned.
Joint teams of police and gendarme special operations have completed their duties and left their seats to the commandos.
The commandos who settled in Japhes neighborhood are also taking precautions to prevent the terrorists from leaking again.
In other counties, security will be left to the commandos in areas where the joint teams have cleared the terrorists.
A ton of beans for the police and soldiers.
The municipality of Kilis sent 1 ton of baklavas to special operations officers and soldiers serving under difficult conditions in Cizre, Sur and Silopi.

The synopsis told me about the night of the horror
The people of Chinar reacted greatly to the attack.
Most of the houses around the apartments where the explosion took place have become inadmissible.
"My son was injured, but we couldn't leave the house because of the gunshots.
An hour later, we were able to take my son to the hospital."
"In the explosion, my wife was injured while sleeping in the room, " said Sabiha Özcan, stating that she had been injured.
Dragged to the door."

Applying for UNESCO for a no-woman island
Japan has applied only for the list of UNESCO World Cultural Heritagees in 2017 for Okinoshima Island, which is allowed only men to set foot on it because of its temples.
However, the clergy class on the island opposes this decision because they are concerned about the "Turist future."
Saudi Arabia has not given up on TÜBITAK
Science, Industry and Technology Minister Fikri İl, Turkey's Scientific and Technical Research Agency (TÜBITAK) stated that a new agreement has been made for the sale of the Ballistic Video Analysis and Information System (BALISTICA) second party to Saudi Arabia, adding that "Ilave 8 will serve from 6 to 14 in Saudi Arabia, covering the development and installation of the system."
Light has made statements about the BALIA developed by the Institute of Space Technologies.
The light said that ballistic analysis of the system's weapons, bullet cores and shell casings in the cases allowed ballistics to be compared to the data found in the central database, so that the problems that ballistic experts encountered as they examined the shell casings and bullet cores were eliminated.
Light expressed that data and accompanying information from different geographical locations can be questioned by hiding together through BALISTIA.
Noting that one of the most important features of the balistica is the ability to obtain and display more detail and less three-dimensional data that makes mistakes, Light stressed that the system's innovations allow the ballistics expert to quickly make decisions and that success has greatly increased.
BALISTICA exported as part of Project SUBA-1
Noting that the BALISTIA met all the criteria for its success criteria and received full marks from the Security General Directorate, the system established in 10 areas, particularly Ankara, covers Turkey, he said.
Speaking of the success of the system, Light reminded that the "SUBA-1 Project" with Saudi Arabia had been exported and was successfully completed in six regions in 2013.
Light said that a new agreement had been made for the sale of the BALIA's second party to Saudi Arabia, that the SUBA-2, which is a continuation of the SUBA-1, was signed, said the agreement covering the development and installation of the additional 8 systems would increase from 6 to 14 of the number of BALIA that will serve in Saudi Arabia.
A crocodile fossil the size of a bus was found.
The length of the prehistoric sea crocodile was reported to be 10 metres long and 3 tons of its weight.
The crocodile's skull alone was measured at 6 feet [6 m] long.
Researchers named the species "Macimosaurus rex" and published the findings in Cretaceous Research magazine.
Federico Fanti of Bologna University, chief author of the article, said the fossil, which turns out to be 130 million years old, was "almost the size of a bus."
Speaking to the Washington Post, Fanti said the gigantic saltwater crocodile "was at the top of the food chain in at least a certain region at that time."
Paleontologists say that M. rex, thought to be the largest crocodile in the sea, was ambushed in the lagoons.
The largest fresh water crocodile in history is thought to be the "Sarcosuchus Emperor," which lived 110 million years ago in Africa and South America, reaching 40 feet [12 m] and weighing 8 tons.
They're all so confused!
The first book by author Ece Temekuran, published in 1996, "All Women Are Confused," was adapted by the Aysa Production Theatre to the same name.
Deniz Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, İpek Türk's Source, Kadir Çermik and Şebnem Sönmez are running the game.
For the first time, the play of 'Poz' and 'Kure Tight' is still going on, which is the first time that Flyer has ever experienced writing and directing, questioning the confusion in women's minds.
The game met with an audience last week at the Trump Performance Center.
The play begins with radio theater.
In the dark, a voice that leads us back to the past years...
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing by the window, about to jump down.
It's obvious who he is and why he tried to kill himself, by interfering with his next-door neighbors.
HE LEAVES A MESSAGE
"Ebru Uysal," played by Sea Cayser, is a popular writer.
Abandoned by her husband, but that's not the only reason.
It's been piling up since you were a kid.
Her lack of fatherly love, her exclusion in her student life, her lonely childhood, her miscommunications, her lack of understanding, brought her to this point.
He decided to commit suicide by leaving a letter behind, but he can't jump out the window.
Because the mystery woman who lives across the street from Aysel (Zeynep Kankonde), the chatty and naive cleaner of the apartment next door, 'Perran' (Sebnem Sönmez), is holding her to words.
They're treating it like it's a normal, normal process.
She gets more nervous and can't concentrate and jump.
When the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' (Ipek Turk's Source) was involved in the three-way conversation, it turned into a riot.
The 'Meltem', who approached the situation in its own naive and sincere manner, can't help but sing when it sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt takes on a different dimension when the realtor's 'Murat' (Kadir Cermik) enters the girl's house with a spare key.
The singer 'Meltem's lying misinformation to the press is driving things out of control.
The game also uses Nazan Priority's "Street Girl" song.
THE LAUGH OF THE NEIGHBURGHT
For the first time, Flyer has managed to maintain the pace and flow of the game.
The game's comedy burden is drawn by Zeynep Kankonde and Silk Türk.
The caricature types that the two are playing are able to make the audience laugh with both their gestures and their lines.
While Ýbnem Sönmez is able to convey the experience of years to the stage, Deniz Cakır performs a convincing performance to reflect the depressed state of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Cermik, whose performance in Tolga Steel's award-winning film 'Sarrmaşk' also successfully accompanied these four women.
A single act, described as a crisis comedy, promises to laugh without confusion.
I often remember the beautiful words of 'Perran', played by Shebnem Sönmez, saying, 'They read music; they see life and death.'
All children have thought of dying once to punish their parents, and for some reason they've always cried.
She's hanging in the air like an unintelligible joke.
She's always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important part.
In fact, every story begins with some kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pockets; I can't stand things without pockets.
You don't know where to put your hands.
The more we get confused, the more our hands multiply.
People talk behind their backs about what they don't understand, make things up.
A misunderstanding would be real.
All women are confused because they're confused.
Since you can't manage to die, you have a chance to live.
'Enjoy your inferno. Live long.'
It can be consumed safely at any age
"The protein is more nutritious than Yogurt, because it contains essential minerals and vitamin B," said Expert Dietian Principle Enç, which says that milk is the main ingredient, but is more useful than milk, but that miraculous food is one of the nutrients the kefir can consume with every certain confidence at any age.
B1 is also rich in vitamin B12 and vitamin K.
Because of calcium and magnesium content, it is the basis for a healthy nervous system.

Friend of the intestines.
This unique drink, which does not end in counting benefits, is a friend of the intestines.
We have 1.5 kilograms of bacteria and mushrooms in our intestines.
Microorganisms in the digestive system are divided into two groups, which are useful and harmful.
Useful microorganisms are called probiotic microorganisms.
The activities of the probiotics have as important an effect as our liver, and when consumed enough, it prevents harmful microorganisms from sticking to the intestinal wall and spreading.
The balance of healthy microorganisms in the intestine causes many diseases.
With the right diet, the health of the digestive tract must be protected.
To do that, we must certainly consume enough of the probiotics.

In regular use of kephyr, the intestines work, the bowel defects are removed, the swelling decreases, and you have healthier digestion.

At Mersin Training, which completed the first half under Brent Korkmaz, on the day of the start of the half-time camp, the technical man and the 48-year-old man left the road.

Letters from little students that are touching
Police and soldiers operating terror operations in the region, central Sur district of Diyarbakır, have received letters from children in the west for moral purposes.
At first Aksaray 75.
İstanbul West Ataşehir Natural Science High School and Eskişehir Atacagğ Middle School, including Cumhuriyet Elementary School, launched co-ordinated work.
As a result of these studies, students in the schools published choreography of chocolates in the form of moon stars, and then produced almost 1,000 letters, poems, and paintings.
The children later sent their work to Diyarbakır Security Directorate.
Diyarbakır Security Directorate has established an exhibition desk for the Western children's co-ordinated work.
The exhibition, established at the New Security Directorate building, included students' work.
The exhibition was first visited by police officers and citizens who served at the Security Directorate building.
It moved those who read pictures through letters of meaningful writings and poems.
A student who wrote a letter about ongoing operations in the central Sur district said in his letter, "Our dear police are grateful to you for the sacrifice you made to protect innocent people in Diyarbakir."
It has been learned that the exhibition will continue until next week.
He named his daughter 'Angela Merkel'.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, whose policy for refugees has been criticised from time to time, was named after another refugee baby.
Memun El Hamza, 26, who escaped the war in Syria to reach Duisburg, Germany, and his wife, Tema El Havr, 21, named their first child "Angela Merkel."
"We are grateful to be here.
To show this, we named our daughter Angela Merkel."
Baba Memun El Hamza said, "Germany has become like a mother to us."
This is the second 'MERKEL'
The baby Angela Merkel was born on December 27th.
According to German media reports, little Angela Merkel, who weighs 3 kilos 300 grams and was born 55 centimeters [55 cm], is in good health.
Last year, a Gana refugee named his daughter Angela Merkel, and some refugees opened the "Merkel Ana" banners to support Merkel.
In the United States, consumer confidence is at the top of seven months.

With this result, the market prospects for the index, which has registered its highest level since June 2015, were 92.9.
"The consumer trust has moved its growth to the fourth month, with the improvement of prospects for future economic growth," said Richard Curtin, director of Michigan's consumer research, in a written statement.
"In general, individual financing expectations have maintained its highest level since 2007 because of the weakness in inflation," he said.
The statement also included the prediction that consumer optimism will depend on inflation's continuing to remain extraordinarily low.
He recorded his best annual performance since 2004, with an average of 92.9 last year, according to the results of a survey of 50 questions per month with at least 500 people.

Putin licks his spit
Russia is preparing to recognise the status of Turkish companies "can do business with Russia" if it cannot afford other services provided by Turkey, while the Russian Union of Tour Operators has made a statement that "Russians do not give up Turkey."
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which calculated that the removal of existing economic ties with Turkey would cost Russia additional costs, has drafted and published a new "Istinical situations" draft for the Russian government concerning Turkey.
According to the draft published in the Russian Federal Charter, Turkish companies and companies are expected to be allowed to do business with Russia, even if it is necessary to enter the area of sanction.
According to the draft, other sources outside Turkey are impossible to obtain, or Turkish companies and companies can be used for products and services if domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs.
Which Turkish-based goods and services will be included in this category, and the Russian Ministry of Economic Development will set a mixed commission to co-operate with other relevant ministries.
So he can be elected by bureaucrats to decide which Turkish company can work with Russia.
Again, according to the same document, state enterprises in Russia and private companies will have to prove to the commission that their work with Turkish partners is not relevant.
If the draft is approved and implemented by the Russian government, a record of privileged Turkish companies will also be created in Russia.
Russia's Association of Tour Operators said yesterday that Russian citizens have not given up on Turkey.
"Despite the ban on tourism and Russian Foreign Ministry's recommendation to go to Turkey, our citizens have begun searching for the formula for organizing their vacations alone," the statement said.
In online social networks, the number of articles titled "the most practical and cheapest way to vacation in Turkey" is growing like an avalanche.
The most common suggestion is to book hotels online and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitriy Medvedev described the low price of oil for less than $30 as "dramatic" for Russia.
"It was a very bad surprise for our government as no one thought the oil would go down to $30.
At this rate, the budget will not be possible as it is now," he said.
It's the last month of 2015 we left behind.
Following the crash, Russian President Vladimir Putin announces that economic sanctions will deepen.
In those days, our businessmen, our THY personnel, who were trying to get to Russia in the usual order, are officially suffering at border crossings.
Turkish goods are being dragged through customs, subject to unthinkable controls.
No more than a month passed, and yesterday Nerdun Hacioğlu from Moscow reports.
One way or another, sanctions are getting soft.
But why?
The reason is simple.
It's because in an era when the economy is so global, closing the border crossings with the methods of a century ago, your efforts to turn political conflict into economic war are no longer disintegrating.
Look, we're still writing stories about Iran and how the economic embargo has been drilled over the years.
Two neighboring countries, like Russia and Turkey, who seem to have a lot of friends, but aren't at all, are actually in need of each other.
It's technically impossible to tear apart a business man, a tourist, an entrepreneur, and a client on a night like that.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other's country through the chimney.
Before the sanctions create the new Reza Zarrabs (Riza Sarraf) it is best to hold the political debate at the table and settle the score there.
Without ever messing with the economy...
Attacking hotel in Burkina Faso: 20 dead.

It was discovered that the martyr was registered to the Adana population.
Diyarbakirs did not support the terrorist act!
According to information, at 5 p.m., an action was planned against operations at AZC Plaza in front of Diyarbakır Yenişehir district office district Ekinciler Street.
No one at the level required to participate in the act of making noise, where citizens were invited with brochures and calls.
Thousands of people participated in earlier actions, while noting that the citizens did not support recent actions.
The group, which did not provide enough majority in front of AZC Plaza, was disbanded before it could carry out its actions because it was not supported by Diyarbakır citizens.
Terrorists burn schools in Diyarbakır
According to information, the incident took place on 1007th Street in Yunus Emre neighborhood of central Kağlar district.
A group of masked terrorists who entered Nuri Zekiye Has Middle School at around 7:30 p.m., fired the Molotov cocktails and fled after setting fire to the building.
Citizens in the vicinity reported the situation to the fire department after the building went up in flames.
The fire department called the police and asked for security measures so they could get into the area.
Several police units were then dispatched to the area in armored vehicles.
Fire departments came to the school after security was taken and put out the fire before it could cover the entire building.
The police were then involved in the crime scene investigation, while multi-pronged efforts were launched to apprehend escaped terrorists.
On the other hand, some policemen present at the scene tried to help journalists get a picture, while a policeman tried to block journalists who wanted to get a picture.
The ATM thieves got away with it.
Police teams from the İzmir Police Department have launched a study on the complaint that some people have been copied bank card information and received money from their accounts outside of their information, which is being spent.
As part of the investigation, police identified the perpetrators of the incident as M.M.G. (43) and R.O. (32) and identified the suspects as copying citizens' card information with the help of "card copying" and "minicam" that they placed in different cities in Turkey.
The suspects who found out about the card codes have been identified as processing with these cards.
In the operation carried out, the suspects were taken into custody.
Investigators of M.M.G. and R.O.'s laptop have obtained numerous video recordings of the mini-cam system set up to obtain the passwords of citizens operating at ATMs, identifying that the indictees have been staying in cities for a short period of time to avoid detection.
The suspects were also found to have gained 50,000 lira in unfair earnings by copying 15 different ATMs in Izmir.
Suspects who were referred to the courthouse following police procedures have been arrested.
Officials have warned citizens to check their account movements against such events regularly and to screen them with their hands during the ATM access.
Netherlands: Assad should be tried in The Hague
Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders said Syrian President Beşsar Assad should be tried at The Hague's International Criminal Tribunal (UCM).
Speaking at a conference in The Hague, Koenders said Assad was responsible for the refugee raid.
Noting that there will be no peace coming to Syria as long as Assad is in power, Koenders noted:
Assad needs to be tried at the UCM in The Hague.
A man with so much blood must answer to the judgment.
Assad is also solely responsible for the refugee raid we are facing.
However, I am aware that Assad will not be leaving his post anytime soon.
This matter needs to be discussed first, and Russia needs your help in this area.
A whistling protest against Burak Yilmaz
In the 59th minute of the match against Medicana Sivasspor, protests were raised when Burak Yilmaz failed to reach his goal of passing to Sneijder.
So Burak Yilmaz reacted against those who whistled with a gesture of hand.
Later, the reactions increased, and every time the goalie's ball hit his foot, the protest whistles were heard.
Later, some bleachers supported Burak Yilmaz and protested against supporters who reacted senselessly to their own players.
Later, the majority of the bleachers supported Burak Yilmaz.
Gossip Win: There is no discrepancy in Celtic
When Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place and gets over it, Griffith doesn't care about the words "incompatibility" at Celtic.
The struggle of hearts, the punishment the SFA gave Neilson, and Warburton's shyness in the face of January signatures that broke the unity of the team.
Leader Don's scored five points with Celtic.
The first half of Adam Rooney's penalty was a right win for Aberdeen against the Dons at Pittodrie, and he gave the Dons the opportunity to make a five-point difference between themselves and the Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about words of incompatibility.
Griffith, who has created a rumor of incompatibility at the Celtic, pushes his hand away and states that he and his teammates had no difficulty with an increased sense of surveillance as they prepare to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we feel pressured, I think the players are looking forward to it.
The fact that the Scots don't have a title race bothers the Dutch too, Boer.
Ronald de Boer, former midfielder of the Rangers and former international player of Dutch football, says Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the Rangers.
De Boer, a current Ajax envoy, said: "They don't give the briefs of Celtic games in Holland anymore, why?"
Because the Rangers aren't there anymore.
People don't just talk about the Rangers returning.
They're talking about the old team.
They're talking to each other when they're talking to the teams, and they're taking care of it.
There was a lot of tension in the old team's games, and it wasn't just the Scots who wanted to watch them.
He swore he'd make things right, Deila.
RONNY admitted that Deila Celtic was struggling, but the Norwegian boss said the departure would turn around.
After the defeat against Malmö and shortly after the farewell of the Champions League, the match was followed by a losing match against Aberdeen, a ten-man leader with a five-point mark on the scoreboard.
But Deila said, "Celtic has had some bad times in the past, and we will return."
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know it's very disappointing, and I know a lot of people are angry or upset about what happened.
We're in the same situation - but we have to keep going.
We really, really need Celtic's support because it makes these players feel so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton's January transfers are shy
Despite commenting on some January transfer targets only a few weeks ago, Ranger's boss Mark Warburton withdraws his signature, insisting he doesn't want to disrupt Ibrox's team union.
The former Brentford teacher said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For summer players, there's a pre-season period where you can get them used to it, and we've seen it in our own band this season.
The team's doing really well.
Sometimes it hurts more to add unnecessary players to what you really need.
He's targeting Celtic Michu for retirement
Michu, one of the Swansea forwards, was tied to Celtic at the transfer window, and when his contract with the Swanseas ended, his retirement predictions failed.
When he was 29 years old, he suffered excruciating pain from a troubled ankle for two years, and he could not find a way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts ready for SFA combat over Neilson's comments
When Paterson was kicked out of the game, the Hearts were 2-1 ahead, and then they lost 3-2, turned everything around after the defensive player's red card - Collum's third red card to be canceled in eight months.
Neilson won't give up what he's saying, he insists, "I've never questioned the union, I've never made a comment on performance."
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
The obsessing Hibee was scolded when she sang an aggressive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a bar in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh Derby in Tynecastle, 2014.
"It was a derby match and the heat of the moment," said the offense, adding: "I can definitely say that from now on, I will not go to Tynecastle except in a match with Celtic.
The Tannadice board has confidence in Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly, the Dundee United board still has confidence that the board of directors will make things right -- but they agree that the fall in the field must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the kids ready to go again," Donnelly said.
McIness is happy with "the ugly win" against Hamilton.
Derek Mclness admits that the Aberdeen team had to desperately hold on to Hamilton Accies to see Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half, to see them top five points in the league, to see their seventh consecutive win in a row.
Mclnnes said: "There is no team that wins anything, whether it's trophies or leagues, that way without winning a match."
As unemployment rates rose in Britain, the odds remained the same among the Scots.
In Scotland, the number of unemployed people across the UK grew to 1.82 million, while the number of people left unemployed remained unchanging between May and July.
According to National Statistical Office (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 per cent higher than 5.5 per cent in Britain.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland dropped 12,000 in three months, and there are now 2,612,000 employees left.
The employment rate for Scotland has dropped to 74.0 per cent -- an average of 73.5 per cent in Britain.
"The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations of a stronger economy," said State Minister David Mundell, who is in charge of Scotland, commenting on the latest figures.
It's been almost a year since Scotland decided to remain a part of England.
Over the past 12 months, we've seen improvements in Scotland's Business Force market with increased employment and reduced unemployment.
Why am I a witness to an execution in Oklahoma?
Later today, I'm going to watch a man get killed for late legal intervention.
I hope not, but if it does, I'll be sitting in the Oklahoma State Prison watching the death room in the gallery while Richard Glossip is executed with a lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation was first made through his best friend in January, and as shocked as I was, I agreed.
As that day approached, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing this?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will offer a unique perspective.
True, journalists are allowed to watch the executions in the United States, and since there are more practice than available places, a terrible lottery arises as they decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has dropped media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever gets elected will watch without emotion.
I can't do this.
I'm going to sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and over the past months, I've also developed a relationship with him as a result of phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I love that guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison officials said I couldn't be both a witness and a journalist, so I won't be given pens and notebooks so I can record what I see.
I'll try to remember all the details.
An Oklahoma journalist accused me of compromising my neutrality via Twitter.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he likes it, gain access.
I complained to him.
And he agreed that he could say it better, but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip disagrees with me in some of the things I say and write.
He won't tell me what to write, and if he did, I wouldn't accept it.
I told him he could take me off the witness list anytime he wanted.
But he wants an international reporter to be there to write about it.
If he dies, he thinks that spreading it to the public will help the anti-lethal movement.
A reporter from the Huffington Post, Kim Bellware will be with me.
If you would like to know more about this, please listen to my podcast series.
I'm not gonna go over all the details here again.
I have no idea for certain that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What Barry Van Tree did after his death was enough to make him an accomplice.
But I still believe he's not guilty of murder.
I certainly don't believe there's enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution was wrong.
And I'm going to watch him die with that perspective.
I can't really claim to be objective.
You can look at the other reporters there for that.
The impressions you're going to get from me are the impressions you're going to get from the person who watched a man who was killed unnecessarily like him die.
After a wet police chase, the man was convinced of the Canning River.
Canning Vale police officer remained dry while convincing the man out of the Canning River.
The alleged escape from a police car behind a Perth man ended in shallow, muddy water, when a police officer "convinced himself to come gently back to shore."
Canning Vale police were summoned Tuesday for breaking and entering in Beckenham.
When they saw the suspect, he broke into the Canning River and tried to escape from the police.
But he didn't get very far.
"The senior sergeant Shandell Castledine stood in the water and said, 'I'm not going out, come and get me," he said.
Police Officer Lachlan Perhavec refused to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic -- "good police negotiation."
"Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Ben Cousins, the champion footballer, provides a permanent example in mind.
In 2006, a police officer left his car to avoid alcohol control and tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful, but he inspired the locals to plan a Ben Cousins biathlon as a joke.
Peter Moody claimed that the butlers ratted him out and threatened him to quit the race.
Peter Moody claimed that last year, Racing Victoria's stewards tried to organize a stable in their stables and threatened to leave him immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the stewards and the unit department, and said they had a personal campaign against Lady Tatai in the last feed for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he was always trying to do the best in racing, and he told Lidari that when the job gave positive results in the cobalt, he found himself in difficult conditions that he couldn't explain.
He said he'd been biting his tongue for 18 months, and he didn't want to look like a smoldering grape.
"I wasn't going to say it, and I covered it up for a long time, but sometimes you get so angry, and it just happens all of a sudden," said Moody.
They know this is going on.
Sometimes you react, and you suffer the consequences, and I will suffer the consequences of what I say.
I'll sleep fine when I get home tonight.
I want to walk around with my head held high and let my bosses know that I'm trying to do my best for them.
When they start thinking I didn't do it, I shouldn't be a trainer anymore.
I'd think about what I'd do with my license.
Moody had previously detonated a bomb in a rapping.com interview accusing the unit department of being a snitch in his own barn.
"Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man -- if asked -- and offered to give him a job in my stables in exchange for telling them what I was doing in the stables," said Moody, at Racing.com.
They clearly believe I'm a con man.
Well, if that's the case, they all need to return their biscuits because they weren't capable of catching me.
Robert Roulston, the former president of the RVL, David Moodie, the new head of the RVL, and the current director of the RVL, knew about it then and now they know about it.
Does that make me think it's getting personal?
The RVL has a series of balls, and maybe it wants to make people responsible for what's going on in the industry except for the trainers?
Am I bad for industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe the people out there think I am.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I'm saying will make them think.
But where I come from, I don't care about anything, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I'm going to put pressure on them, I'm going to be responsible for making decisions for them.
I have the support of my family and I walk away.
His disappointment over the long-standing cobalt investigation that included Lidari and the next scratch has put him in a position to say, "Throw my license across the table."
In preparation for the undefeated champion, Black Caviar, Moody described the rule of racing day care as "funny," stating that it is against the rules to put mud or clay porridge on the horse's feet.
It's against the rules of racing.
I must take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my men accidentally put the mud on his foot.
He could've taken it last night.
He could have taken it yesterday, which he did.
He took the day of the race.
Moody may face three months of suspension due to the use of porridge on the day of race care as a result of an investigation by executives.
This is a joke.
Those who make these rules don't know anything about the horse.
"We understand that we need rules, but this has gone too far," Moody said.
A hit-and-run driver in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a guy who ran into a biker in Cobram this weekend.
The biker was taken from the air to Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him on Murray Valley Highway.
Police said the driver who was hit fled the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old Nathalia man surrendered to a police station in Shepparton.
He is expected not to stop in an accident, not to help, and to be blamed for other traffic violations.
At age 40, Cobram biker remains stable at the hospital.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responded strongly to his opponents' claims about wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy described criticisms targeting his own team as an effort to "make a day" for the NRL's two favorite winners.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that in the semifinals in Sydney Friday night, the judges allowed the referees to "coddle" with their own team in the game that Storm lost.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett described the match as a "designation" match for the rugby league and said that two Oueensland were not "too big" in wrestling after his semifinals against the North Queensland Cowboys Saturday night.
Bellamy defended the team's struggle and said they were only focusing on the theme when they fought.
Bellamy said he was strengthened by criticism from two leading teachers because it meant they were worried that Storm would beat them.
This is going on -- when they beat us 24-2, I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about wrestling, Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I guarantee we haven't changed anything in our defense systems or techniques all year, just in the last six weeks, we've made a real emphasis on our combat contacts, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years, and obviously he's got a big team to teach, and he's probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It's funny how it happened this time of year.
Bellamy disagreed with Bennett's idea of "exciting football," reminding Bennett of Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons winner, playing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
How exciting was their game," Bellamy said, comparing Saturday night's games to our game on Friday night.
I remember in 2010 when St George was criticized for being a boring team, and Wayne said he wouldn't even give a rat's ass.
But now he's got a team to play football that we can call exciting football, and especially young half of them with their speed.
This is the kind of football you want to play when you have players like this.
In 2010, he set this spot, and now everyone wants to play this kind of football -- not every team has half of Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt, so it's impossible for them to play this way.
It gives me more confidence because even they talk like this because they're a little afraid to play.
Six weeks ago, when they went to the big games, they probably didn't think of us.
Bellamy also pointed out that Storm and Roosters had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos game was probably a good game, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
Our game is 20 to 18, our game has more scores on both sides, but this is exciting football?
Or is it exciting to cut the attacks but not make scoring attacks?
That's the agenda for me.
If they're talking about us, that means we'll be meeting them here at a later stage.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys, or Cronulla Sharks, won their first final match Tuesday night at AAMI Park, so they don't have it this weekend.
Serbian man released on $200,000 bail for drug crime
The man who was arrested on 40 kilograms of cocaine that was smuggled into Queensland and facing a life sentence was released on bail for $200,000.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five people caught last month by the federal police following the 100kg of drugs from South America via Vanuatu from the Soray yacht, which was dropped at the port in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen at the marina all morning with his accomplices, and then met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilograms of drugs inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential life sentence for possession of a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he had attempted to have all the drugs and that he might be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was worried Maksimovic was a flight risk.
He has open connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia frequently," he said in court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about where he was staying in a public case.
Maksimovic's parents offered him $200,000 to bail him out.
"It is clear that after reading both people's affidavits, the $200,000 bail price is literally a financial burden on them," Judge Flanagan said.
However, he warned that it was not enough alone to keep him from going to trial.
Maksimovic was released on bail in exchange for handing over both Australian and Serbia passports, going to the police station every day and following curfew between 6 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Stevan Hogg used the girls' phone to lure pedophiles to the scene.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for child abuse images.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while sleeping, logged in on an online texting service, providing a series of inappropriate children's visuals sent to him by another user.
Then she woke up and realized she didn't have a phone, and found her phone in the sleeping Hogg's hand.
He looked at her and immediately noticed disturbing messages before warning her mother.
The police were interested and saw five images, then analyzed the computers found at the address, and discovered the "interested" web search using terms to find inappropriate children's pictures.
Hogg later claimed that the reason he did this to the officers was so he could run the pedophiles on the Internet and act like cops and scare them.
"This is an addiction -- an addict that frightens people, " financial deputy Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
He admitted that the calls were made by the computer, but he said he was doing it to scare the pedophiles into acting like a police officer.
He was asked about talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send more pictures.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he got sick ideas when he drank and wanted to watch rape and murder footage.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the messages on her phone, she cried out to her mother, and she was shaking and crying.
The mother saw inappropriate pictures on the phone, and the charges followed.
The girl was interviewed, and she said she used computers and Playstation to look younger than the defendant.
23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing inappropriate children's pictures on June 14th last year, violating bail on 25 January this year and not attending court on 24 March this year.
Gregor Sim, a defence attorney, said Hogg should not be included in the category of sexual crimes because it may be disputed that there is "no obvious sexual element" in this crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the case until October, when his social background report was due.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but was detained for other unusual cases.
There's been a record of sexual crimes prior to the date of the sentence.
Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech in parliament
Early this year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell down the stairs as he fell off a podium.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The parliament's opening was tainted with claims by opposition lawmakers that they received anonymous death threats if they booed him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
In his address to the nation in parliament last month, they booed him and interrupted him repeatedly -- he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, leader of the Democratic Movement for Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received messages on their cell phones so that they would not disturb him during Mr. Mugabe's speech.
"After Mr. Mugabe's speech is over, the message to the journalists comes from an invisible number, but the title is 'death'," he said.
He tells the members that their immunity is valid within parliament and that when they leave parliament, immunity does not work.
The party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "worried" due to threats against politicians, chief spokesman said.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 30,000 jobs.
Hewlett-Packard will end between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs in terms of restructuring and cost reduction efforts in corporate service.
Later this year, HP will be assigned to two listed companies, which will separate computer and printer jobs from faster-growing company hardware and service operations.
HP reported that the expected layoffs would result in around $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
"These restructuring activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Corporation," said Meg Whitman, head of HP, who will head the post-separation unit.
"Whitman, the Hewlett Packard Corporation will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a large, deep portfolio that will help them move on to the new business style of companies," he said.
As a separate company, we are in a much better position to provide for the growing needs of our customers worldwide.
The Hewlett Packard Company's annual income will be more than $50 billion and will focus on offering non-responsive integrated technology solutions for companies, according to a company statement.
His garages in Palo Alto split the company called the birthplace of Silicon Valley and founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to build electric equipment.
HP is going through a major reorganisation to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, one of the world's largest PC manufacturers and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, is one of the latest moves in the industry in the belief that firms have better performances.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says Wilshere had problems with his teammates' injury prior to the Dinamo Zagreb match.
Wenger stressed that Wilshere's injury occurred in September and that his treatment was planned, and that there was no reason for him not to play at Christmastime.
The best-case scenario is that Wilshere is going to miss at least four games in England, and given his history, it's unclear whether or not he'll participate in the European Championship next summer.
The most embarrassing thing about the last problem is that Wilshere ended last season strong after a separate ankle injury, followed by a search of his old sharpness before the season.
This kind of injury career is not threatening, said Wenger.
It's a bone that's not fully healed.
It's no big deal.
It was just an accident.
This has nothing to do with his wrists or previous injuries.
In a medical perspective, that may be true, but as Wenger will agree, there is also the danger of further injury by a returning player in mid-season.
There's also an uncomfortable pattern developing.
According to research conducted by Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different diseases recorded since the beginning of six years ago.
He played only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
In the big picture, Arsenal has been one of the two First Division teams that have often lost to injury in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious cycle, but Arsenal believes the injury record last season will last.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you have a time when you're vulnerable to injury, it's a process where you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I trust it, and I believe he'll make the career he deserves.
He has Chelsea to play in front of the Arsenal against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, and the Tottenham Hotspur to play next Wednesday, preparing the Wenger team for them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn't go to Croatia, which means they're going to play Arteta with Mathieu Debuchy.
Wenger can also replace Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
"I'm trying to protect the balance and give them the breath they need from the players," said Wenger.
Although Arsenal is an open favourite of Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most feared stadiums in Europe.
After Dynamo produced his own "Undefeated" campaign last season, 41 games have not been defeated.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake of 3.2 on the Richter scale Tuesday night.
This is the 10th concussion in Zagreb this year.
Wenger Arsenal believes he learned a lesson last season from the defeat of Monaco in the Champions League, and continues to be motivated by his remote goal of bringing the club his first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous," says Wenger.
It's never been like this in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I have enough experience to be realistic.
We're passionate, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: The comedy program that teaches us serious lessons in men's friendship
The absence of similar portals in programs is remarkable, especially at a time like this when men need more to open and suicide rates among young men are at the height of 15 years.
In 2013, it was the biggest cause of male deaths between the ages of 20 and 45, and it was three times higher in men than it was in women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Anti-Lawful Life Campaign (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of the Male and aims to oppose the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the center of the struggle to carry out this difficult task.
A study among high school students showing more than 2,000 depressed symptoms showed that if the person suffering from this affliction has a high number of "healthy mode" friends, their chances for recovery have doubled.
Likewise, for those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces mental challenges that can arise in half.
But, of course, for friendship to work, it has to be accessible first.
In this age of social media-based communication, the focus of style rather than content makes it a priority to respond quickly rather than with meaningful communication.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to look like powerful, fun-loving, successful people, even if it's really all about isolation.
Artificial success is under the control of what psychologists call externally motivated concepts - money, image, social status - inner values that have deeper impacts on our mental health - our inner longing for self-improvement and friendship - going to waste.
As a billionaire video games creator recently explained, money does not buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was turning this focal point upside down.
The characters were defined not by their work, but by their personality, and by their interaction with their friends.
Joey and Chandler's frequent hugs, the minutes they watched football in comfortable chairs, Ross' contact with Rachel all came from the knowledge that men could actually relate to their feelings, even if they stayed in the background.
What a helpful employee tells me is that, as I listen to people who are depressed and suicidal, I see how even the smallest interaction between friends can make a difference.
Most of the men who communicate with us can't talk to their friends.
A feeling like "getting along" is very strong, and so is the idea that opening up to others is a sign of weakness."
One of the programs I came up with when I suggested long-term coping mechanisms was Friends.
He stressed the small moments of his male friendship.
In line with my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people when they're struggling, but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why don't you take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful environment where the scenes are redesigned to celebrate?
Or, better yet, if you see anyone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don't know what difference your friendship makes.

Di Maria made it easier for PSG to beat Malmö with her goal
Angel Di Maria celebrated with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring a goal for Malmö.
At the start of the Champions League, Angel Di Maria made it easier for the PSG to pass the competition on Tuesday with a goal for the Swedish team Malmö.
Here's the game report and the reaction to the game.
In the match with Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris began the Saint-Germain Champions League fight on Tuesday with a two-0 free and clear win against Malmö at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria was a PSG player who scored four minutes before the French champion made his move to the Champions League, but in the 61st minute, they didn't take advantage of Cavani's second goal.
Paris, with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, needed a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of the qualifying groups, but also to improve their quarterfinal performances in the last three championships.
But the game they played was not the best game for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penalty area, and was later sided with the team of his glorious career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win in the Champions League, whether it's in the League, whether it's out there, but it's going to be a problem for our competitors to win 2-0 in this regard, and even though there are some things we need to improve during the season, it's a good start to give them a good look behind," Blanc said.
That's a good sign.
Even though we didn't score one or two more goals, we wanted to win, and we won.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team with a change of three players in the 2-2 game with Bordeaux in the 1st Division at the end of the week, but in the fourth minute he remained in Di Maria's shadow.
When the Argentinean wing player was transferred from Manchester United last month, he was seen as a player to bring PSG to a higher level in Europe, and in Marco Veratti's pass, he ran behind Malmö's defense and showed that those who thought so were not wrong.
However, everyone was disappointed that the PSG would win a great victory.
In this round, Malmö, who eliminated Celtic from the playoffs, was in the field with nine international players, with a five-man defense and two in midfield depth, a heavy opponent.
In the 34th minute, Nikola Djurdjic made very few attacks, except for the shot that pulled the pole off the corner that Kevin Trapp was protecting.
On the other hand, the PSG allowed them to slow the game down with unnecessary passes and inefficient finals, and in the first half, Ibrahimovic was unable to make at least five aggressive moves, and when the second half started, he was disappointed that Cavani was unable to keep up with his game.
However, when he came to organize his colleagues, he showed that he was more skilled, and in the 52nd minute, it was Ibrahimovic who passed the curveball that Di Maria sent to Wiland's castle.
After a full hour, the second goal was completed, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan player recorded Maxwell's sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic's pass, in his head from the left wing.
Malmö ran out of ideas to go back to the game, and after Ezequiel Lavezzi's unregistered goal in the game, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's shot in the empty position, and he didn't let the score change.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was a class superior to its own team, saying the Norwegians: "Our final Champions League game was in December last year."
Since then, we've only played ball in the Swedish League, not at the same level as him.
The qualifying teams aren't enough.
Hats off to Paris.
It was a great game for them.
Glencore made $2.5 billion in stock sales.
Swiss-based mining giant Glencore took a hit on the falling price of processed goods and acquired $2.5 billion Wednesday by selling his shares as part of his plan to divide his debts.
Glencore, listed in London, said he sold a new stock worth £1.6 billion to pay off his own debt.
The company, which lost 57 per cent of its market value this year, has been seriously affected by the price of goods dropped because China's economic slowdown has caused an increase in demand and caused turmoil in markets.
The issue of rights caused Glencore's stock prices to rise early Wednesday morning on the London Stock Exchange.
The shares increased by 0.69 per cent higher in the FTSE 100 index, increasing by 2.77 per cent to 131.60p.
Last week, Glencore announced a $2.5 billion stock sales plan, part of their plan to reduce the $30 billion debt pile by a third.
The company sold its new bonds for 125p per share, which was 2.4 per cent off Tuesday's closing.
He sold 1.3 billion shares, equivalent to 9.99 per cent of the group.
Concerns about China's long-standing growth cut iron ore prices roughly in half, while coal, copper and other goods fell between 20 and 40 percent.
White House Confirms Xi Jinping's Visit to Washington
The White House confirmed on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will make an official visit to the United States at the end of the month.
The statement said Xi's first official trip to Washington would take place on September 25th and was a return visit to Barack Obama, who arrived in Beijing last November.
Following bilateral talks between the two heads of state, US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will host a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife, Peng Liyuan.
The statement also stressed that "President Xi's visit would expand US-China co-operation on two countries as well as on regional and global issues and would allow President Obama and President Xi to address issues of conflict constructively."
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to arrive in Seattle before Washington and meet with some US tech leaders and then move to New York City to join the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are also expected to address some controversial issues involving Washington's concerns and China's claims of sovereignty in the South China Sea concerning allegations that China is engaged in cyber espionage.
Matt Damon pretends that the diversity of filmmaking is insignificant.
Matt Damon opposed African-American film producer Effie Brown, saying it was not necessary to be behind the camera during a discussion about diversity.
In the HBO's Project Greenlight Sunday night episode, Brown stressed the need for alternative perspectives on the black main character in the selected script, while the experienced actor interrupted.
When we talked about diversity, Damon claimed that you would do it not in the cast of the show, but in the cast of the film.
The shocker, Brown, is that the actor's comments of the Martian film continue to react in such expressions as, "Um, wow, okay, okay."
Damon and Brown were brought together by the Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the finalists of the show.
Brown first said, "I wanted to get people to think about how to treat the character of Harmony, no matter who the director is."
The only black character is a hooker shot by a white chattel.
Dear White People's publisher insisted on finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for the rights to direct the film, and Damon replied that their assignment could end "in a way that we don't want."
After the debate was published, there was an explosion of dissatisfaction with Damon's comments on social media.
"Because Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, this person can explain its diversity as a pain in the ass," said Twitter user MrPooni.
After tweeting, he received 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments came at a time when the right racial expression in the media was at the forefront of social debates.
After being killed in 2014 by a young white police officer named Michael Brown, Black Life is Important, the move effectively encouraged lawmakers and officials to halt discrimination against colored people across the country.
In February, the singer Prince spoke in a covert way about the move when the Grammy Awards nominated for Album of the Year candidates.
He said the albums are still important.
Like books and black lives, albums are still important.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Life Important movement issued a statement in response to the question of whether Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an important figure in Fox News, should the group be considered a hate group.
Leaders said the Black Life Matters The Network is a love group.
Damon was recently announced on the list of performers, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the identification of the Catholic Church in the West.
It's still unclear whether he accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" crowns its first champion
Professional rock climber and busboy Isaac Caldiero won the American Ninja Warrior programme Monday night and won the $1 million prize.
This competition, which entered season seven, had never seen a contestant who could complete all the steps on the obstacle course.
In the season finale, Caldiero and Geoff Britten made it to the final round.
The last mission was to climb a 20-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete this course in his time, and thus succeeded in becoming the first athlete to complete the tough fourth phase of the American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero finished this course three seconds before he did.
After this difficult win, Caldiero spoke to E!News in shock of winning the $1 million grand prize.
Isaac told E! about a huge raise in his salary, saying, "I think it's great to even think about it, because I've never made more than $10,000 a year or made a living."
I mean, it just happened... I can't imagine what it would be like... the future is unpredictable.
Producer Kent Weed also met with The Hollywood Reporter for the final, and Britten explained why there will be no awards, even if he is the first contestant to finish the course.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest.
"If anyone finishes more than one, the fastest person wins the prize," Weed said.
Although money was a great prize and life changed, he also won a huge bonus.
I don't think he had a bad idea about it.
He's so happy he did what he did.
He got tons of praise from his fans.
He's a great man and a family man.
A hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff told me, "If anyone's gonna beat me, I'm glad it's Isaac."
I think if their role had changed, Isaac would have thought the same thing.
The American Ninja Warrior has renewed the contract for season eight and will begin shooting in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers just passed Minnesota Twins.
MINNEAPOLIS -- the second half of the season wasn't very pleasant for the Detroit Tigers.
Tigers, once one of the best in baseball, are now the last in the American Central League.
The Tigers, who reduced their game to defeating, managed to beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field by performing an excellent game on Tuesday.
The Twins have lost the chance to rise to the wild card of the Second League of America, over the difference between the Houston Astros and the Houston Astros.
For Detroit, even for one night, it was a return to the good game that was rarely seen in most of the second half of the season.
In the words of Brad Ausmus, the Tigers' manager, "all victories are pleasant in any way."
With the Tigers' pitcher, Alfredo Simon, scored three points in the first two, he was able to score one in the sixth and ninth shots, showing support for the early offensive.
Simon (13-9) fired 6 3/1 in sequence, and three of them were running.
This was only the third quality start of the last nine tours.
"I just want to close the year strong," said Simon.
It's hard for the bench to waste every game, so I wanted to dive deep into the game.
Tigers' selected hitter, Victor Martinez, scored three strikes, and two of them were running, which was the first RBI he's won since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hitting night since the four strikes against the Seattle Mariners on July 6th.
"He shook the stick tight," said Ausmus.
He looked good (in shooting practice) and was already significantly better at BP, which continued in the game.
At the end of the seventh strike line, Twins got the best chance to get back in the game.
The midfielder, Byron Buxton, doubles on the left field line, starting the batting line.
Right field player Aaron Hicks was only able to take a slow hit, and Simon caught second baseman Brian Dozier swinging before he picked up BlaineHardy, left-handed.
Mauer, the only player who could stand up to Miguel Sano, who beat right-winger Drew VerHagen in the two-run race, had the courage to move forward.
With a pair of runners in the second tier, VerHagen managed to lure third baseman Trevor Plouffe into a double game.
Plouffe hit the DP for the 27th time this season in the big leagues.
After Detroit made the run to guarantee ninth place, Mauer crossed the RBI and made a break for the Tigers and approached Bruce Rondon at 5-4.
However, he was caught by Sano in three launches for the fifth right-hand rescue.
Detroit took advantage of Phil Hughes, who lost his form, leaving early.
The Tigers won three runs in their first two shots against the experienced right-handed player who had been out of the field for over a month because of the back burn.
"Clearly, this is not the game I want to play," Hughes said, "but I felt more comfortable in the sequel, and I managed to make some pretty good shots in the third shot."
The first time, after a successful shot, Hushes took second baseman Ian Kinsler out of the game.
J.D. Martinez's two-time strikeout left Victor Martinez single in the first round of the game.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to beat the 0-21 band in the scoring position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos watched with one shot to the right, won another run, but Victor Martinez was shot trying to make the third one, so the threats ended.
The Tigers added in the second, a pair of outside catchers, James McCann, and a couple of outs from midfielders, Anthony Gose, making it 3-0.
"It was a big hit," said Paul Molitor, the Twins' manager.
He didn't hit it very well, but he threw it in the right place.
Hughes, who counted the shot, scored three shots that didn't score until he was replaced by A.J. Achter, the right-handed savior.
Hughes was charged with three runs and four strikes in six.
Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez is out of the game because of the pain in his shoulder he used to throw.
He'll be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of cripples for shoulder pain since mid-August, has been scheduled to start working on Wednesday.
In Sanchez' absence, the LHP will start with Daniel Norris DL against the Twins.
Norris and the Tigers have been 1-1 in four games since the match on July 30th for the transfer of David Price.
He hasn't played since August 20th because of the pain on the right.
The Tigers and Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA), Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy to the world more
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with managing reforms that the economy should expand further to speed up growth.
"China, foreign investment should improve its opening policies by attracting expertise," he said at the Group Leading Group of the 16th Centre to strengthen General Reforms.
While encouraging opening, Xi said new reforms would bring new energy and freshness to create a new area for economic growth.
The group adopted a series of proposals, such as the negative list that regulates market access, slacken border control policies, encourage government-owned organisations (SOE) to incorporate private capital, and review the registration system of residents.
According to the statement, a negative list of restricted sectors and businesses for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be tested phase-by-step and developed by testing programs.
This is an important move, because it will give the market a bigger role in allocation of resources and will make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
At the same time, the government will loosen its control over companies, allowing companies to run their own affairs.
At the same time, it said, China will study new forms of cross-border economic co-operation in border areas and new mechanisms will come into play to encourage regional growth.
More space will be opened to private investments to open sectors controlled by the state.
"The government will not change its policy for foreign investment, and will provide them with better services by protecting the interests of foreign-funded companies," the statement said.
In addition, the need for foreigners to receive permanent residence permits or "green card" will be optimized and facilitated by putting application processes on a path.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing legal rights to practice and raising professional judges and prosecutors.
Following the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli attended the meeting.
Miniature bag is now very fashion-Time Journal Friday's Eki
In the fashion world, the roads go round and round to the bags.
The current that's been moving lately is the miniature...
It's possible to say that small bags attached to the adults also attract attention.
They say everything small is beautiful.
I guess that's the point of view for the bags, too.
When he was barely enough to walk the streets in bags and bags, the wind began to blow in the opposite direction, and the bags began to shrink.
We already had the little bags, but this time they came up with the shrinking of the big armpacks.
These tiny bags can only fit your phone, credit card and key.
The current that began with Céline and Hermès spread with Prada.
The fact that the fanship of the bag turned into a miniature curiosity has also affected the new models.
Loewe presented the fun bags he packed this season in two lengths.
The most elephant-looking of the panda, polar bear and elephant-shaped bags comes out.
The mini-sizes of large bags that luxury brands offer with fantastic names seem to attract the most red carpet celebrities again.
Hermes' "Birkin" bag, dedicated to Jane Birkin, is one of the most popular.
Although Jane Birkin said she didn't want her name to be mentioned in a briefcase with a press release, but that's how memory works now.
Fashion weeks have led to the massization of the mini-bag stream.
And on the podiums, mini-bags are coming forward.
Since they're so tiny, you can't possibly put them on your arm.
They can be used with their long straps crossed.
But on the podiums, we've seen those long straps wrapped around the wrists of models.
Fendi's one of those guys who takes the mini-bag thing to the next level.
He has a suggestion for those who can't fit in the mini bag but can't give up on them.
Friends with big bags, mini bags.
How?
By turning mini bags into a bag ornament that can be attached to their elders.
This presentation on the podiums has been quickly rewarded on the street.
Let's see what we can do!
Skin change in denim
Turkey is capable of competing with world brands on the subject.
He's now enriching his experience in production with design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that black models, which used to be a few, are now taking their place on the shelves every season.
In the season when the blacks rose so high, the tasters found their best friend.
Skin fragments and skin elaborate designs emerge as rebel friends of the denim.
In general, short models with zippers called "motorbike" are on the agenda.
While the strong air of the skin is completed again by the black parts, the chiffon long blouses, the glittering sweats provide a stylish view of sports.
Back in the day, young people used to wear 'em and want to get lost in the crowd.
It was supposed to save the day.
Now young people want to carry a piece that emphasizes elegance as well as comfort.
In this respect, it's possible to say that Loft understood the target mass with the collections and the complementary parts that he had prepared.
Little step for Banksy, big step for "global."
The world premiere of "The Art of Banksy" collection, which put together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
An exhibition of 85 original works, the work of the artist for 15 years, was the first exhibition of the Global Watchtower building.
The first exhibition of mysterious street performer Bansky in Istanbul opened the day before yesterday at Global Knorr (Rhythm Street).
The world-famous artist who was hiding his identity and using his name, of course, wasn't at the opening.
We don't know if he came to Istanbul.
But Steve Lazaridas, the curator of the exhibition, says Bansky doesn't even know about this exhibit.
There's no reason to ask her permission.
Because the path of old friend Bansky and Lazaridas left after 12 years.
Some of the exhibits were collected from Lazaridas and some from collectors.
But there are things that Bansky Christians are curious about.
What would Banksy think of the "The Art of Banksy" exhibit where his 85 works are put together?
What would he say if he saw the little store at the end of the 800-square-square-square-square-foot gallery area?
Did the Red Balloon Girl, the Cleaner, the Rose, make a noise about things like the scarring of the world, that they were printed on cloth bags, wallets, necklaces?
It's disappointing to Banksy followers that the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit, who hides his identity, has become such a consumer.
That's not Banksy's style.
But you'll still get the limited number of tickets before they're sold out!
For Banksy, the big exhibit for the small, globalized world can be seen until April of "The Art of Banksy."
They are the lowest and the most unjust.
Why don't you go dig a ditch?
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan continued his reaction to academics signing the declaration.
Erdogan said, "These are unjust, these are despicable."
Indeed, those who are with the wrongdoers are wrongdoers.
He said, "They committed the same crime because they were with the killers."
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who replaced the explosion in Sultanahmet, said: "In this act in Sultanahmet Square, which smells like history and civilization, I also shared our regrets with the German Chancellor for the death of 10 of our German friends in such a region.
I would like to extend my condolences to all German people from here first to the families of the deceased."
"Our fight against terrorism will continue with determination," he said.
Erdogan, who continued his reaction to the academics who signed the declaration, said: "I especially condemn academics who stood up and issued a black declaration against all these terrorist incidents and signed under those massacres again, and I strongly condemn them."
It doesn't make anyone enlightened that our nation understands who's who, the professor in front of him, the professor.
These are dark people.
Those are the wrongdoers, the lowest of the low.
Since they were with the massacrers, they committed the same crime.
Here's the incident in Çınar, where will these three-year-olds put Mevlüde, who was a martyr with his father?
How do they fit their conscience to stand by his killers?
I call on all judicial authorities, the senates of universities, for these actions against our constitution and our laws.
Yesterday, I told him that the steps needed to be taken must be taken quickly.
Let them do whatever they have to do.
Those who want to do politics should do politics in parliament.
But if they can't do it in Parliament, then they should go dig a ditch or go up the mountain.
I'm making myself clear.

Marking teacher's doors
At Gazi University Faculty of Communication, a paper was posted on the door of some professors saying, "We don't want it in our university, which supports the PKK."
Under the paper, the phrase "Gazi Communication" was added.
1128 academics signed the declaration "We will not be a party to this crime" by the group 'Academics for Peace Initiative'; numerous responses came to President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and government officials, particularly.
The academics who had been investigated because of their signature began to be detained and suspended.
At Gazi University Faculty of Communication, some of the professors' room doors were hung with papers saying, "We don't want it in our university, which supports the PKK."
Under the paper, the phrase "Gazi Communication..." is added.

Safik Duğen is off on his last journey
Celine Dion has lost her husband.
René Angéllil, wife of Canadian singer Celine Dion, died.
Angélil discovered Dion's talent when he was 12 years old and married in Montreal in 1994.
After Angélil was diagnosed with cancer in 1999, Celine Dion took a break from her career.
'I found 26 in search of two wrestlers' children.'
Mete Gümürhan's second documentary, "Young Wraiths," 66.
The Berlin Film Festival (11 February 21 February) was the first Turkish documentary selected for the episode "Generation Lplus."
Gümürhan, originally from Edirne, but also from the Dutch production company, explained why and how he filmed the documentary he completed in the summer of 2014.
The documentary "Young Pehlivans" about the story of six American boarding school students, who aim to become world champions in wrestling, will compete in the Berlin Film Festival's "Generation Kplus."
The first Turkish documentary selected for this episode, the Young Pehlavans, is one of the candidates for the Crystal Bear award.
Even though he was born Dutch, he was originally a Edirne director, Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a kid, he listened to oil wrestling stories from his grandfather in Turkey, where he came on summer vacations, and he watched the competitions.
"There are not only political problems in Turkey."
I wanted to tell the world what else happened in Asia Minor.
"For example, from our horse sports wrestling, unfortunately not known," he wants to get together with six directors and do a documentary project.
This project will fail, but one day the news of the magazine he read on the plane will open the door to another project for Gümürhan.
'We stayed at the sugar factory'
Mete Gümürhan, a 10-11-year-old wrestler who tracks down two younger brothers, goes to Samsun, where the family lives.
The kids' dad won't let us shoot for the documentary.
" I thought about what I could do all day.
Because support from the Ministry of Culture could have been withdrawn."
Dad was talking about a boarding school in Amasya where the kids would go.
That's where I thought I'd go.
When I was looking for two kids, I met 26 kids at school who were interested in wrestling.
We started shooting in a week and finished the permits.
We didn't even have a place to stay.
"We stayed at the candy factory's dorm."
The biggest difficulty of the documentary, which was completed in three weeks, was the language that made the director.
"I didn't know what I was going to face when I was filming," Gümürhan said, saying three different languages were spoken on the set where the foreign cinematographer and vocalist worked.
"They didn't speak Turkish either," he says.
Young Wives are focusing on the story of six of the 26 children's wrestlers.
Aaron, who was raised by his grandfather and had a weight problem, couldn't attend the training because he broke his arm, but had ambitious but health problems, Bethollah, the lovely child of the school, Umi, the youngest champion Ahmet, and Muhammad who held the group together...
Mete Gümürhan explains his work with children: "I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I shot the first week and a half at practice.
What I wanted was for the kids to pretend they didn't have a camera.
"Thankfully, they got used to it quickly."
It's a surprise to be chosen in Berlin.
"We were prepared but it was a surprise that we were elected to Berlin," Mete Gümürhan said, saying he did not expect the young Pehlivan to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival.
Young Wives aren't a sports documentary, they're a product of children's struggles and their lives.
"I wanted to bring up stories about children with family problems who can cope with their efforts to identify and their problems," he says.
Support for academics from the art world
Following the declaration of "Academies for Peace Initiative," the storm broke down yesterday as it led to the opening of investigations and detentions of academics, with statements of support consecutively coming.
The first support came from literary people, including many famous names.
The other day, the filmmakers announced their support yesterday.
"We, as artists working in theatre and stage-show arts, stand beside this honorable gathering of academics calling for peace, we are on the side of freedom of expression, equality, right to life and unconditional peace," the 138 theatre performers said in a statement.
"We add our voices to the call of academics to negotiate and peace with our conscience and with all our hearts."
More than 400 filmmakers including Deniz Türkali, Attila Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Onur Güçük, Yeştü Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçlik said, "We are with free thought and art.
But without it, but without it, "We will not be a party to this crime!"
We are with the Academics for Peace Initiative," he said.
"We are with academics who have been made the target of the lynch campaign," the Association of Cinema Writers (SİYAD) said.
The Academics for Peace Initiative issued a statement titled "We are not a party to this crime" in Ankara and Istanbul on January 11th, calling for peace and talks with the government.
The text included 1128 academics at 89 universities, as well as the world-famous Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoglu sharply criticised the academics' statement as "supporting terrorism," calling on the institutions to "do their job."
After this call, some universities dismissed academics, while the prosecutor's office launched an investigation.
Yesterday, several academics were taken into custody.
I'm a fan, please help me!
Sultan Hürrem's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin hair...
Trying to look like a celebrity is considered normal to some extent, but it is viewed as a psychological disorder from the point when life began to completely affect it.
'Celebrity word syndrome', a.k.a. worship of the famous, is a new topic that has already become an academic subject in the world, and we have it.
It's only natural for a lady to run through hair salons with her famous photos.
But don't forget the year of 'Hürrem Sultan' where all teenagers walk around with Irish red hair.
It's already been reported that Beren's nose is leading the aesthetic operations of 2015 that we left behind.
It's not so different on the frontline, gentlemen.
Once upon a time, dressing up as Polat Alemdar was a disgrace.
Now it's just the opposite wind blowing around.
Justin Bieber, we're surrounded by boys.
So much so that the useless information we quoted was read on the Internet thousands of times: "First, when you go to the barber's office, cut the sides of your hair, your ears, and the circumference, into the upper part of your head."
But the sides will be short.
After you've finished cutting, you must mold your hair with light water.
Fix your hair with spray help after the decoding process is complete.
"Justin, to get hair, you have to shape it when it's damp."
All of this, which has already become an academic topic in the world, brings to mind the newly spoken 'Celebrity word syndrome', a.k.a. worship of the glorious syndrome.
Celebrities fans are seen as a love ball in us.
Artists brag about how much it affects them with fan numbers.
Fortunately, psychology doesn't see it that simple.
Especially when teenagers decide what to eat, what to drink, what to listen to, what to wear, and what to wear according to celebrities.
Excessive devotion to the names presented as unattainable is described as role modeling mental illness.
Expert psychologist Sumeyye Demir acknowledges that Turkey is behind in the work in this area.
But he also doesn't forget that the families are slowly conscious: "One of the main issues of psychology is that one has peace with oneself, one has peace within one's own identity."
At first, it wasn't very serious for children to fill their rooms with posters, to dress up as someone.
That's changing now.
His parents feel the need to intervene.
"A passionate commitment to someone is a sign that something is wrong with the young man's life."
Fans on emotional roller coasters
The interest in celebrities is safe if you don't overdo it.
Not wanting to marry him, jealous of his wife, preferring to dress him, he suggests attention to the symptoms, Iron.
We're talking about famous people.
To worry about them, to be connected with their lives is to some extent normal.
But in the majority of young people who, in the opinion of the expert psychologist, miss the top of the cantar, say, "When there is no virtue in the family or in the environment, when there are no names to represent the child at the point of good behavior, it certainly fills the void."
It's not always a good example.
"He's copying the negatives, too, kid."
When we consult on how to approach them, Sumeyya Demir begins by reminding the celebrity that passion syndrome is more of a teenager.
Given the fact that teenagers may be insecure, the problem is more comfortable.
On the one hand, we're complaining about the limitations of their families, and we're dealing with young people who are looking for support and compassion: "We have to consider their emotional ups and downs."
New research shows that they're struggling with changes in their brain.
"A young man who rides a emotional roller coaster "must be greeted with passion, gentle approach."
It's possible to change behavior.
Specialist psychologist Sumeyya Demir reminds the parents of their duties to overcome celebrity worship syndrome:
Get to know his emotional distress, make sure you're calm before you get to the point.
Never let him suppress his emotions.
To encourage independence, state that you respect his admiration.
Instead of teaching him with insults, show him a good example, discuss his role models.
Try to take together the place of celebrities in our everyday lives.
Reading books about the real world of fame together will help.
Make sure your communication is transformed into adult adult form.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same way in the brain.
Share with your child that mistakes are an opportunity for change, accept it as it is.
Make sure you get expert support for the fan.
He admires those who are angry and those who envy them.
The basis for celebrity worship syndrome is that it needs help and help from someone else.
Unstoppable love, actually, is a cry for help.
Unfortunately, that's not how it's perceived.
Moreover, this problem is so common that it is impossible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu points out that there are certain names in every country that keep television busy.
It's more of a syndrome that connects to these celebrities: "They're extraordinary."
The majority of them don't have the resources.
Those who have it don't live by pretending to be them.
It's either because they don't embrace it or because they don't dare.
"But those who have no means and who can't live like them continue to follow with anger."
There's no difference to those who are envious or who watch out of anger.
They're both deeply admired.
They make easy money, they're on the agenda of the magazine.
Just knowing that is enough to increase the fan.
Another suggestion from expert psychologist Sumeyya Demir is to question the reality of those lives at this very moment.
It must not be overlooked that artificial lives are at stake.
That's where the support of the environment comes in for someone who's passionate about the celebrity.
However, he insists on admitting that the celebrity he's a fan of has problems like his own.

Should I have gallbladder surgery?
Dr. Fevzi Özgönul answers questions in his corner of the newspaper.
I have a rock in my gallbladder, and every morning when I wake up, I go to the bathroom two or more times a day with a stomachache after meals.
Could that be keeping me from losing weight?
I'm using alkalen right now, but I can't get enough to eat, so I can't lose any weight.
Ever since I was a kid.
What should I do?
Do you think I should have gallbladder surgery?
The gallbladder stone is often accompanied by an infection.
These complaints of abdominal pain that develop immediately after eating are also a sign that when you eat, the gallbladder is contracting and emptying its infected gall into the intestines.
The entrails, which are disturbed by infected bile, are rapidly trying to throw this bile out.
That's why you guys go to the bathroom so often.
And because you go to the bathroom so often, what you eat gets thrown out without digesting, and it's slow to lose weight.
I think you need to get this treated.
If you go to a gastro-enterologist and the situation I'm saying is detected, you'll be able to avoid it using antibiotics.
But eventually, you might have to have gallbladder surgery.
Alkalen probiotics may reduce your complaints a little, but it won't.
Whatever happens, I suggest you keep using the alkaline probiotics.
Because this probiotic powder is the biggest help for you to lose weight.
I eat a lot when I'm stressed.
Teacher, when I'm stressed and nervous, I feed myself and gain weight.
How can I handle this?
ANSWER: Excessive urge to eat means that the need for energy can't really be met.
It may be because you've had a little food or you've skipped lunch in the morning.
Another reason is that you can't digest the food you eat.
To do that, your digestive system will have to work well.
If you don't have ulcers or reflux or anything like that, the easiest way is to use a good propiotic drug.
You'll find it very useful.
I can't gain weight, the doctors don't know why.
There's information in your column that's usually designed to weaken.
It all makes sense to me, but my situation is a little different.
I can't get any weight.
Most importantly, I don't know why.
The doctors aren't saying anything.
ANSWER: Our techniques are not just to weaken, but to restore the physical study of the body to its ideal size.
Fatness and weakness are the same kind of discomfort.
It's the same technique where you can't lose weight in fat or gain weight in weakness.
You get weaker when you eat sweet and pastries.
I think you've figured that out by now.
It is possible for you to gain weight with carboxipuncture and healthy nutrition.
So you've lost weight in your ideal body.
Our other patients got fat from their ideal bodies.

If the system problem goes away, you'll gain weight, they'll lose weight.
But first, the system has to work properly.

The kid who feels worthless gets stuck in hate.
There are some emotions in the human sense world that are born.
Fear, sadness, happiness, surprise, anger, anxiety...
However, feelings of hatred, hatred, revenge arise in children over time and due to some wrong attitude.
Every man needs to be an individual, including his childhood.
So if parents or social circles respect their decisions, they want to be asked about their interests and made to feel valuable.
They are the basis of a healthy personality structure.
For example, the child's decisions regarding the child's affairs (what to wear, what to eat), how to ignore the child's wishes, and how to resist its own rights (to be sent to an instrument course for a child who wants to go to a football course) means not to respect the child's personality.
The defense mechanism reveals a sense of anger and hatred to protect it because the child who is not respected for its self has lost its freedom to be himself.
"Because, in fact, anger and hatred are the opposite of acceptance," said the psychologist Hilary Arslan, who said the child did not accept what was done to him by hating and trying to explain to him and to his environment that he was valuable.
"The hatred here means 'I'm in', and it serves the purpose of keeping the boy's respect for himself."
He says, "If the child is allowed to become an individual, the hatred will disappear."
The child seeks to protect himself by harboring anger and hatred.
At an early age, the parents of children, both physically and spiritually vulnerable, say that exposure to verbal and emotional violence by their environment can lead to negative feelings in the child, saying that neglect will make the child feel invisible, undetected.
"It may sometimes be that only emotional needs are not met (e.g. not to caress your hair, hug or kiss you, not to care for your school or other needs), or sometimes your physical needs (e.g., drinking, housing, school needs, etc.) are not met," he added.
This is a growing attitude that leads to hatred.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are actions such as humiliation, insults, contempt, insults, unnecessary and severe punishments, feelings of worthlessness, shouting.
Such behavior touches deeply because it is directed at the child's personality.
"The child either loses his self-esteem by accepting them and spends his life struggling with the feeling that he is unworthy, unworthy, and unworthy of being loved, or he tries to protect himself by taking refuge in anger and hatred."
