28-year-old Chef Found Dead in San Francisco Mall
The 28-year-old cook, who had recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
But the victim's brother said that he did not think that he might have wanted to harm him, and said, "Surely things were going well for him."
The San Francisco Forensics Agency reported that the body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as the 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Galicia.
The San Francisco Police Department has reported that the cause of death has been determined to be a murder, and the investigations are ongoing.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told the ABC station KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as the kitchen chief in Boston, had received his dream job six months ago and started working as the kitchen chief of San Francisco Sons & Daughters.
The sons & Daughters official noted that this death "turned them into a life and they are extremely sad."
"We are a small team working here as a tight family, and he will be very missed," he said.
In this difficult time, we would like to point out that they are not alone with Frank's family and that our prayers are with them.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially stayed in hostels and said, "It was finally going well for him."
Louis Galicia said to KGO, "He had an apartment and was going out with a girl."
Louis Galicia said he didn't think he might want to hurt his little brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
The way to connect with the family was always to prepare a plate for us, to cook for us," said Louis Galicia.
He didn't like to engage in an argument.
My brother would fit in with anything.
"When everything else was going to be licked in the world, it was this untreated diamond that sparkled every day."
Informed people were asked to call the SFPD Warning Line on 415-575-4444.
Assistant doctors on strike: Calls for new job slowdown
Representatives of the assistant doctors have asked their unions to allow business slowing down in relation to the dispute over a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors' Committee (JDC) called on the general council to support more work slowdowns from the beginning of September.
The ministers have not been able to resolve concerns about the contract, the JDC said.
Assistant doctors and medical students voted against in the contract agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of the voters.
In a Twitter post Thursday night, JDC chief Ellen McCourt said the government remains "continuously silent" about the problems that led to the rejection of the contract.
"In light of this, the JDC Board of Directors voted to completely reject the proposed new contract and called for an official negotiation on concerns again," he said.
In response to the government's silence, the JDC administration has made an official request for the BMA Board to allow a programme to increase business slowdown from the beginning of September.
The dispute led to the participation of assistant doctors in six strikes this year, including the first total cut in NHS history.
Assistant doctor leader at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the BMA had been rejected by the contractual terms.
During the meetings before the doctors and medical students voted, 54,000 assistants told the members of the BMA that this was a good deal to be accepted.
Following the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said the contract would be put into practice to be valid for doctors in the UK.
Russia and Turkey: An 'incompatible alliance'?
This was a gesture that ended the crisis.
Russia and Turkey's leaders met Tuesday to formally end the eight-month war, which was carried out by handshake and words and economic sanctions.
Vladimir Putin St. While greeting your Turkish counterpart in the showy hall of the Palace of Petersburg, I was clearly attracted to the impression that Ankara was the party who wanted this reconciliation the most.
Shake hands, yeah.
But Mr. Putin's smile was rather weak, and it could not be said that even his own limited standards were emiting any warmth.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdogan has repeatedly mentioned his "good friend" Mr. Putin; according to a report, five times.
I'm surprised at the number.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to the pre-crisis level, but would reach much higher levels.
The next day, a newspaper here stated that Mr. Erdogan acted as if nothing bad had happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the cold impression that Mr. Putin gave around showed that the Russian leader had forgotten nothing.
In fact, the first thing he mentioned at the opening statement was the cause of the crisis: Turkey's shooting down Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
Russia's reaction at the time was full of rage.
Mr. Putin made a hard exit and accused Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The resentment was much greater, and the other side was thought to be friends.
Confidence will be really hard to rebuild, perhaps impossible.
The idea of the Russian people has changed since November.
The state-controlled media has been targeting Ankara in a traumatic and aggressive manner for months.
Suddenly, the Turks were guilty of everything.
The most serious of these were the accusations that Mr. Erdogan's family profited from illegal oil trade in areas controlled by the so-called Islamic State in Syria.
He firmly rejected it.
But St. The official message from Petersburg was time to move on.
In the end, the reason why this meeting took place was because Mr. Putin had received the apology he requested from President ErdoÄŸan.
Russia can see it as a kind of victory.
The benefits of the call for a truce for Ankara are very clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs friends after the failed coup last month, which will almost overthrow.
He was also impressed by the recurring terrorist attacks in Turkey.
Economic reasons are also effective.
The sanctions imposed by Russia have been severely challenged, especially the ban on special flights carrying several million Russian tourists to the coastal regions of Turkey every year.
This number has dropped by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies were absolutely relieved that the flights would continue.
They rely on the end of the season in the Mediterranean.
And this week, state television predicted a decrease in prices for fruits and vegetables by re-allowing imports of Turkish agricultural products.
If we quote a story in the Vedemosti newspaper, "Tourists there, tomatoes here."
However, the visit had a separate political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West because it does not find the reaction to the coup attempt adequate.
When the long-standing anger over the progress of talks on joining the United States has progressed in the pace of snails, Mr. Putin, who wants to benefit from Turkey's ties with the West and the coldness in between them, comes into play.
The Russian leader certainly seems to have received sympathy from Ankara due to his call for the support of elected officials after the coup attempt.
It should be noted that this was an inevitable attitude for Moscow, which himself had a deep fear of regime change.
This summit, held in this flamboyant palace on the seaside, represents an "incompetent alliance" as an analyst explained to me by Russia and Turkey: the two countries that the West has rejected and behaved badly, uniting forces.
However, despite the appearance of this reconciliation, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of them is about Syria: Although Moscow has made it a mediator, Russia and Turkey support different sides.
After almost three hours of first talks, the two presidents said that this issue was not addressed at a press conference.
While the President of Turkey was clearly refraining from answering a question about these differences, Mr. Putin chose to underline them.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine the common ground in Syria.
However, after months of open hostilities - and given the absolute catastrophe potential that emerged when Nato member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter plane - it is certainly a good development when the two leaders start talking at least.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing for customers outside Scotland
According to the statement of the president of the bank executive board, the RBS brand will move to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand is related to the bank's global goals.
Since it almost went down eight years ago, you had to retreat and give up.
During this time, brand strategists used 'RBS' to protect other consumer financial brands.
This was supported by millions of pounds for many sponsorships, from the Six Nation rugby championships to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But now, it has been decided that it would be right for more national brands to stand out.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but no new beginnings will be made.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS will be changed to NatWest, except for the situation of being quoted to the center and the stock market.
The Ulster Bank is currently being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands that will take on a much more dominant task for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEwan gave an interview on a tour of customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
"The RBS brand will no longer be a trader's investor brand and the brand where our staff are employed," the BBC told Scotland.
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying we have local goals, not global anymore.
Each of these brands will stand out in a slightly different way in the community in which it is located, and our staff will work with customers under the name of these brands.
RBS announced that it would not continue to sponsor the Six Nation Championship and that it is raising the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
"It's time for us to move on to the understanding of a bank of brands because (we're asking ourselves) how can we make this a better bank for customers?" he said.
If we had stated that three years ago we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would offer these brands, I would have found it sarcastic.
But I think you will see a lot of changes with the work we carry out and focus on the needs of the customers, not ourselves.
We can reactivate these brands, so I think it's the right time.
Frankie Dettori won the 3000th time with Predilection victory at Newmarket
Dettori burst champagne after winning 3000th victory with his double success at Newmarket
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th victory in England on Friday at Newmarket.
On the local track, he won the second victory of the night with the Predilection trained by John Gosden, reaching this milestone.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the barrier-free race.
He's following the tracks of Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
"This is a special situation," said the jockey, who had previously won three championships in Ghayyar.
I'm so moved to my family being here
I'm really happy that this happened 30 years ago at the Newmarket where I started this business.
This is not an important meeting, it is not a Royal Ascot - an ordinary Friday night with only 20,000 people.
I feel light and relaxed.
Dettori accepted cheers by bringing Predilection after victory
In the handicapped race, there were two jockeys reaching this milestone: the champion jockey Richard Johnson and the retired jockey, Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4300 in his record-filled career.
Lester Piggott, who won the Derby race nine times, has won 4493 victories in his career
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it's not surprising that only a few people have reached a milestone before him.
A styleful and strong person, but the element that makes it outweigh the scales from others is the tactical mentality.
He represents the horse race in an extraordinary way, attracting people to this sport for years with his excitement and charisma.
A few weeks ago, at Epsom, I told Frankie that he might have won his 6000th victory if it wasn't for a jockey who only competed in weekends and big races.
To be serious, Frankie spent most of the 30 years he competed in the UK with victories, which is good for him.
He has a very exciting character and a very good feature for this English races, but beyond that, he is an extraordinary jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates this milestone with a jumping move, which has become an iconic
From the jumping races to the jumping, from the horse to their jumping, Frankie Dettori has become a symbol of British unimpeded races for twenty years.
It was a full road.
In 1996, he won many major races, including the famous 'Big Seven' victory at Ascot, but survived a plane crash and was banned because of his non-compliance with the ban on drugs.
Three years ago, he showed that he had a strong character in order to make the suspects wrong and return to his best state, although he had difficulties during his return from this six-month suspension process.
And it could continue for a while; Dettori had previously stated that he wanted to continue to compete until he was at least 50.
Russian president Putin dismisses his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly dismissed his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Mr. Ivanov was part of Mr. Putin's close circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as a special representative for environmental and transportation problems.
In a statement from the Kremlin, Mr. Putin "decided to dismiss Ivanov's position in charge of the Russian administration," but no reason was given.
Mr. Ivanov was assigned to this position Anton Vaino, who has been acting as a deputy since 2012.
Vaino, 44 years old, is a former diplomat.
He was born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, and graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute's Department of International Relations (MGIMO) and served as the embassy in Tokyo.
He was later interested in the presidential protocol and the administration of government personnel; the statements on the Kremlin website are in this way (in Russian).
After his assignment, he told Mr. Putin, "Thank you for trusting me."
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of the state in terms of enforcing the law and supervising the implementation of the instructions.
Mr. Putin announced on Friday that he asked the Russian television station to withdraw from Mr. Ivanov's post and that he had offered Mr. Vaino to take his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a shocking move to Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov had long been working as one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies, and Soviet security forces, like him, served the KGB.
He was one of the most powerful people in the country as a special pen.
During a meeting with President Putin and broadcasting on state television, both stated that the special pen was voluntarily dismissed.
However, despite the smiling poses given to the cameras, very few people here are convinced of this, especially during the time of parliamentary elections approaching.
Is this a disagreement from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows about this yet.
However, the official statement that a person who could be president suddenly wanted to direct Russia's environmental policy was met with great suspicions.
According to the quote on the Kremlin website, Mr. Ivanov said to Mr. Putin: "It is true that in a conversation in early 2012, you may call it difficult - even problematic - that I want you to trust me for four years for the task.
Well, it looks like I served as president's chief for four years, eight months.
Mr. Ivanov took over this post in December 2011.
He was previously in the posts of deputy prime minister and defence ministry.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB state security forces, such as Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Putin was the president of the Federal Security Forces (FSB), which replaced the KGB, and Mr. Ivanov was the acting president of the KGB.
When Mr. Putin took power, he pointed Ivanov as one of the five he trusted.
Since it was unconstitutional for Mr. Putin to be president in the third term, it was thought that Mr. Ivanov could be president after the second term of Mr. Putin.
However, this mission was transferred to Putin's next of kinship, Dmitry Medvedev.
After three and a half years, Mr. Putin became prime minister before he returned to the presidency.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after hitting the producer
Gibson got into a physical fight on the show's set in L.A. last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, who produced the series, announced in a joint statement that he had been laid off.
Gibson, who portrayed Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Tuesday before the announcement of the termination.
There were differences and disagreements with creative issues on the set.
"I regret the fact that such an incident has happened," he said in a statement.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios declare that the character Gibson's role in detail on how to get the character he plays out of the program following a group of FBI agents will be given at a future date.
The 54-year-old actor, who had previously appeared in the situation comedy Dharma & Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I loveCriminal Minds, and for the past twelve years, I've worked with him by giving him my heart and soul," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I'd like to stay until the end, but that's not possible anymore.
I just want to thank writers, producers, actors, great team, and most importantly, the best supporters that a program can have.
The show is expected to return to the screens on September 28 for the twelfth season.
The mystery of fish in the garden of Banff
A person living in the Banff area has applied for help to identify fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks these 75 fish could be sandfish carried by a sea hose.
Living 500 m away from the sea, Bain published images on Periscope, hoping that someone would shed light on the appearance of two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Pass: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The project worth 1.35 billion must be completed by May 2017
Engineers combined the north and viaduct of the Queensferry Pass, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "plow fans" that are about to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The cross-section of the bridge from Fife is 600 meters long and 30,000 tons.
It consists of 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The project, worth 1.35 billion, needs to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown was one of the first to walk from land to bridge by visiting the facilities today.
He said, "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Pass.
We all witness to engineering on an epic scale with this project, which uses more than 30,000 tons of concrete to build only this part of the bridge.
Despite the extraordinary size and weight of the bridge that closes the gap between the viaduct and the bridge deck, it is a precise operation that requires extremely precise tolerances for this harmony.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is settled, the concrete casting of the first section of the deck will be carried out in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck will be ready to be lifted on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Gate and Bridge Contractors project, said: "In all bridge projects, the first closing is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closing represents the leadership in civil engineering.
We had to close the gap on the north-or-or-or-free side after the last road deck was also placed and connected to the expanding North Tower level.
This was done when the viaduct in the north was pulled up to 700 millimeters south.
This was very big, but it was also a very sensitive procedure.
The reason it was large was that the viaduct was 222 meters long, weighing almost 6000 tons, and needed to be pulled at about 3%.
The reason it was sensitive was that the tolerance values the team had to comply with were very low, only a few millimeters on both sides.
Luckily, everything went well.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Three men are 'fortunate to be alive'
Three men are lucky to be alive after they crashed from a fishing boat in Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station issued an alarm Friday at 13:20, after the device saw the case in Moelfre Bay.
The three men were trying to swim into a safe area while their boats were on their way.
"We saw the boat circles towards them and we were worried," said Moelfre lifeboat control supervisor.
"Fortunately, he had strayed with strong winds until we were on their way to them."
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the 60-year-old third man was found hanging on to a buoy without a life vest, exhausted.
They were all taken to the lifeboat that was headed to the shore and brought to the lifeboat fleet station
Mr. Jones said, "The three men who fell in the water are lucky to be alive and have never been hurt.
There was an emergency stop cable on the boat engine, but when the boat capsized, it must have been somehow severed from the person who was driving the boat.
Someone was watching these three men today.
A valuable type of hunting for health and happiness, PokÃ©mon Go
It's really astonishing to see how the world has changed.
It was a situation where young people and children no longer go out to play, to spend their free time looking at the screens, and most people have been upset over the past ten years.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move up the couch.
The time spent looking at the screens spread from time to time, especially when it was limited to television.
Therefore, it's really great to see that technology and outdoors aren't the elements that exclude each other.
Of course, I'm talking about PokÃ©mon Go, an app based on characters that were originally created for video game in the 90s (later turned into cartoons, playing cards and other by-products).
Like many facts of popular culture, this new game was a mess when it was presented in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Later, the presentation was postponed in other countries due to the intense interest that caused overloading on servers.
Over the days, PokÃ©mon reached more than Go Tinder and almost the same number of users as Twitter.
So how does it work?
To put it briefly, players take their smartphones, go to PokÃ©mon call as tracked by GPS, and they can take the 'photo' (taking a screenshot on the phone) or 'cavation' of them.
He joined this madness by leaving the couch for a generation that played the game at a younger age.
In the United States, the game "average" increased significantly in the number of steps taken by a person every day.
Cardiogram, an application developed for Apple Watch and monitors 35,000 users, noted that the proportion of people who exercised 30 days every day increased from 45 per cent to 53 percent every day in two days after the recently posting to the Washington Post.
The company does not know who plays PokÃ©mon Go; only can see raw data at the level of exercise.
Most public health campaigns, which encourage people to "stay 30 minutes", "candid out of the hook" and "activity every day," were ignored because most public health messages were boring and transmitted by people who looked devastated.
But still, the importance of exercise is minimal.
People who regularly exercise, the likelihood of cancer or depression decreases.
It provides assistance in issues such as exercise, weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes, and here it has a list of advantages that can not be listed.
But PokÃ©mon Go's beauty is that he takes people out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, all three main elements of health are met: movement, fun with fresh air and sunlight.
Some people can even make new friends during hunting.
As always, there are also grumpy buzzards looking for something to complain about.
And, of course, someone can hit the door while they're walking.
What difference does it make?
A great innovation was presented.
Smart phone apps like Fitbit have tracked our movement, but it has not given us any reason to exercise like this game.
The innovation will wear off and use will decrease over time.
However, due to PokÃ©mon's success, many games will be produced that help people who go hunting through combining applications and virtual reality with real-world activities, to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Biles wins gold medal in women's gymnastics overall review
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic in jumping.
Relax in the balance device.
It's astonishing with the ground.
Perfection down at first.
And he's an Olympic champion now.
The 19-year-old gymnast also completed the overall assessment first on Thursday, making the difference between himself and the rest of the world at the Olympics.
He received 62,198 points, silver medal holder and friend of the "Latest Five" team, and Italian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Simone Biles of the United States performed on the balance instrument at the women's artistic gymnastics general evaluation final at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth and fifth American woman to receive the consecutive overall evaluation award, and announced her name as the best of her generation and perhaps all time's best.
When the last sum was released, she burst into tears, and the long journey to reach this moment ended.
This success has brought sports to the same level as athletes such as Michael Phelps, who can be seen once in each generation that brings sports to new levels:
Biles spent the last three years as a result of 15 world championship medals, 10 of which were gold, and the 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton, as one of the most successful routines of this sport with striking routines, which allowed him to call himself "the best gymnast ever I've ever seen."
In Brazil, a final test was waiting for him, which was not between Biles and other people in the field, but among him and the burden of great expectations.
It would be disappointing to return to the family home in Spring, Texas with less than a handful of gold medals.
Simone Biles of the United States, on the left, and Aly Raisman, after receiving the gold and silver medals in the artistic gymnastics women's overall review at the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics in Brazil, respectively, Thursday, Aug.
Biles won the first one on Tuesday, when retired national team co-ordinator Martha Karolyi served as an exclamation mark at the farewell party.
Biles insists on not looking forward to this long run towards the top, but that is not entirely true.
The part of the ground exercise, including the iconic flipping of the routine, is designed with Latin music that will fully adapt to the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl, discovered by Boorman's mother, became a force during a trip to a gymnasium where Aimee Boorman was coached by her grandparents as a child.
He has not lost any of the general evaluations since the summer of 2013, which is a winning series that should continue as long as he wants.
Although Mustafina assumed the leadership in two rotations, it was temporary.
Biles's balance instrument and ground exercises, which he won the world championship, had not yet been done.
He took the lead with 15,433 points in the balance tool, and crowned it with 15,933 points in ground exercise.
While Raisman was waiting for the last point, he was gently wrapped up in him, and while Biles' vision once in a smear notebook came true, tears appeared around the glowing red, white and blue eye make-up.
Raisman's performance was like a rematch of the performance four years ago, where he shared fourth place, but later lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans called "nine," took the lead.
From time to time, he sent a kiss to the crowd after the exercise where he overcomes with a turn-off that seemed suspicious.
For 19-year-old Biles, it can be said that the tweet he posted a lot later this week has now come to a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims shot while listening to music in the car in case of serial killer
In Phoenix's first serial killer case in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot talking in the car and listening to music, according to police reports released on Thursday.
Authorities, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Maleah, Ellis and Ellis' daughter, reported that she was shot in a car parked on a drive on June 12th.
The report states that the gunman fired eight shots with a gun while standing on the passenger side of the car and drove away in another vehicle.
Police say these three murders don't look like robbery because the assailant didn't take the adult victims' handbags or $2,900.
Deputy Commissioner Jonathan Howard, spokesman for the Phoenix police, said that the shooting led the investigators to investigate whether this was linked to the previous four attacks.
During a four-month period, nine attacks in predominantly Spanish-speaking neighborhoods killed seven people and injured two people.
Earlier this month, Howard announced to CBS subsidiary KPHO, "This happened in the residential area in front of a house."
In the late 1990s, the suspect was thought to have used a model of brown Nissan, a black BMW in a model, including a black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Researchers refused to disclose evidence that led to the conclusion that the attacks were related to the same killer and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was hospitalized for injuries and later died.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died at the scene.
A witness to the incident told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also issued a police report on the shooting, which targeted an empty truck half an hour before three murders.
Researchers found shell casings, pulled a bullet out of a seat, and detected bullet particles in the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old microcephaly patient: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys, and of course, his mother.
Unlike his peers, however, Edmund has a microcephalus disorder, which is a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Picciuto did not know existed during her pregnancy.
When you first came home, my first thought was that I couldn't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't ask for this.
Of course, that's not true, of course you want it."
He and his wife, Vincent, were told that Edmund may never recognize them and even survive.
Some doctors have gone so far as to offer him to be admitted to the nursing home.
"My first reaction was to say that I don't think people are doing it anymore," Picciuto said.
Edmund can walk with the help of a walker.
Edmund couldn't sit up or crawl upright until he was three, and he still can't talk.
But he slowly reaches some milestones.
He can walk with help and ride a bike.
Besides, he likes to play and sing with two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language Edmund made up to say, "Please sing to me."
Picciuto told CBS News, "We're teaching him sign language."
But as we know, it's not sign language, it says Edmund made up his own signs.
Microcephalus can occur due to a number of different conditions; a genetic condition such as Edmund may exist and can be caused by infections caused by viruses such as measles and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and the course of the disease may vary greatly.
It's too early to tell you how people with Zika infection will be affected by this.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of his future.
I kept asking what was going to happen.
What's it gonna be?
And he still doesn't know that.
In fact, I haven't asked a question about the course of the disease for a long time, since I really didn't expect anyone to tell me.
However, Picciuto is capable of offering hopeful advice for the mothers of babies who are born with congenital excuses due to Zika.
It's getting better.
You know it would be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rains and floods mobilize rescue teams in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rains and widespread floods in Louisiana led the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected by Saturday.
National Weather Services reported that there was a flooding in the northeastern Louisiana and in numerous rivers south of Mississippi, which posed widespread flooding after heavy rain flow.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that government officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and that support for neighborhoods affected by the situation is on the way.
Mike Steele, spokesman for the Governor's Office for Domestic Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there have been requests for high-water vehicles, boats and visors.
Steele stated that only tons of visors were requested for Tangipahoa Neighborhood.
There will be a flooding watch in most of South Louisiana by Saturday.
Weather services stated that an additional 3 to 5 inclusion may drop to the area in an additional 3 to 5 inches.
There was a flooding watch in South Alabama on Saturday, as it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge, both in Louisiana, and the Amite River near Denham Springs, are expected to reach record levels during the week.
The forecaster, Alek Krautmann, said that both rivers can flood many houses in suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also stated that the flooding flow in Ascension Neighborhood is a threat, as the full rivers flow into Lake Maurepas will slow.
The Tickfaw River, located just south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, has already reached the highest level measured at 9:00 a.m. Friday.
Rescue teams continue to rescue people from flooding in the Amite and Wilkinson accidents in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the waters from Beaver Creek, normally 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly during the night.
He said that another stepfather who lived nearby had warned him.
"We were woken up and the water was still coming," said Hansford.
It came all the way up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford that this was the highest level he'd seen in the creek in the 48 years he lived here.
Hansford stated that he and his family members were disabled and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said he rescued all three of the emergency workers in a large, military-style truck and took them to the fire station in Gloster, where they took refuge on Friday.
As heavy rains continue, Krautmann said, floods "invasions have become rapidly widespread" and that authorities are considering removing an evacuation order.
Krautmann said an observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain pouring in 13.75 via midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said the ground has been high-saturated since Wednesday.
Authorities said the streets under heavy rains and floods have the need to rescue the residents of the Tangipahoa Neighborhood and the holidays of schools in five school areas.
GIS subsidiary WWL reported that a woman councillor in Tangipahoa said 200 houses were flooded.
The residents were evacuated and taken into two churches, but they are now underwater.
Neighborhood Officer Robby Miller said officials rescued 72 people and seven pets stranded by rising waters.
Bunkers were opened in the town of Amite and for those evacuated in Hammond.
"When the waters begin to retreat, they will be allowed to return home," he said.
In Hammond, Tangipahoa Neighborhood, almost two dozen streets were closed due to rising water, and visors were offered to be taken by residents trying to keep the water away from their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we've ever had was in March," said city manager Lacy Landrum.
That sounds like a similar incident.
In Mississippi, Harrison Accident Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said that the rain continued steadily on the Gulf Coast.
He said Tuesday that several homes were reported to be flooded, but there have been no notifications so far for Friday.
Keith Townson, director of Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has been living in this area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen water before," Townson said, adding "and there's still rain."
6-year-old Mahaj Brown, "throught hole in body bullets", survived the Philadelphia attack
Police say the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second time a 6-year-old boy was shot in the city this week.
CBS identified Mahaj Brown for Philadelphia by her grandmother and grandfather.
His grandmother and grandfather Brown stated that there were more than one gunshot wounds on his body, including the groin area, legs, arms, and abdomen, but was conscious of being brought to the hospital.
His grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station, "He suffered a lot, his tiny body was punctured with bullets."
Oh, I can't believe this.
The boy was listed among those who maintained the critical condition of the child in the hospital and undergoes some surgeries.
The family told the station that he was expected to recover.
He was going to start freshman year at the local school.
Brown was among the four people shot in the Germantown area.
Two 29, one 32-year-old male were shot.
CBS Philadelphia stated that one of the 29-year-old men was critical, while the other two victims were stable.
The station reported that the child was found shot in the front seat of a car with one of the critical 29-year-old men.
The other two victims weren't in the car, and the police are investigating whether one of the wounded was an assailant.
Detectives have said CBS may have shot multiple gunmen at Philadelphia.
The crime scene was full of shell casings in the style of assault weapons belonging to different assault weapons.
Apparently, it certainly was a long-term conflict.
There were casings on the street and both sides of the pavement.
This indicates that there were more than one gun attacker and that both were active," Philadelphia Commissioner Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
More than one house and vehicles in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made, and police have reportedly been able to examine the security cameras.
Another six-year-old girl was shot in the arm with an accidental bullet while playing in front of her home in the West Oak neighborhood on Tuesday.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
The reason we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
I named this year's Women's Olympic Gymnastics team, and there are more than one reason for that.
First of all, I've been to all the Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been more dominant.
Second: This team has three gymnasts that inspire many girls of different ethnicities: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team, which was brought together by Jew Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
The team finally looks like America.
It also strengthens the presence of women of black and Latin origin at the highest levels of this sport.
Over the past four years, the first female gymnast has always been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were in 1st and 2nd.
That's strong.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion, and America supported him.
Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, now three world world championships, will be able to witness their outstanding performances of unexplained but skillfully performing gymnastics routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth consecutive American to win the gold medal in women's overall assessment.
And his teammate, Aly Raisman, won the silver medal.
We are diagnosing the best times of this sport, but that's not the case in gymnastics courses across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same path as Aly and Madison to take part in the Olympics.
The reason they are the "Latest Five" is that there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi will coach.
But in reality, gymnastics is a costly sport and gymnasts work primarily in special gymnastics clubs, supported by parents' education, travel, jersey, competition, hotel fees (for trainers, gymnasts and families) and many more.
Most of these gymnastics clubs are located in the wealthy suburban neighborhoods, which can support these businesses.
These clubs require a costly and long-term commitment for the families of gymnasts and the only place where gymnasts can train.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have been training these athletes since the day they started gymnastics.
For countless young girls affected by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, we do not offer communities more affordable and accessible gymnastics training.
I founded my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we offered free and low-cost gymnastics training to over 15,000 young people (priorly black and Hispanic) in the city based on Harlem and coached both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (where I grow) to offer quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and take advantage of this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics improves the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and provides the characteristics of mentally strictly working, discipline and stability.
This combination offers long-term advantages in terms of health, success at school and at work.
It's going to be the inspiration of this team, which will lead thousands of young girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Participation in sports activities is especially important for girls.
We're going through some really exciting times.
To Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison as an Olympic team, thank you for bringing the gold medal to show the "Power of Girls" and motivated many young girls with different backgrounds to become a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected, assistant doctors decided to continue the strikes
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after a consensus was reached on the agreed agreement with the British Medical Association officials, but 58 per cent of the 37,000 assistant doctors who took the vote voted.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced his plans for sanctions on the contract, stating that NHS "no one has property" and that further delays would harm staff and patients.
The first group of assistant doctors was put into the new contract, which included changes in working practices at night and on weekends to improve care outside the normal hours.
Dr. Dr., the head of the M.E.A.'s assistant doctors committee. "Assian doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially that it will trigger the current labor crisis and not have an equal attitude to all doctors," Ellen McCourt said last night.
Progress is needed to make progress in this process, which only has eight weeks left for the first group of doctors to be transferred to the new contract, and time is about to expire.
BMA's efforts to resolve the dispute by talking were met with government reluctance to interact and, in some cases, deafening silence.
This is a development that occurred despite Jeremy Hunt's promise that his door was always open last month.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act immediately, lift the sanction, and listen to the concerns of the assistant doctors."
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors make it clear that they are prepared to increase work slowdown actions.
During the last strike at the end of April, almost 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments were postponed, nurses and consultants had to take care of the doctors on the strike line.
The ministers hoped that the dispute would end after the agreed agreement with the British Medical Association officials was reached.
BMA wants improvements in weekend wages for 54,000 assistant doctors.
NHS Employers executive director Daniel Mortimer urged assistant doctors not to take any strikes.
"Grev does not solve anything, but it puts pressure on the already busy team and services, causing anxiety, discomfort and distress for patients, caregivers and their families."
Over the past two months, we have continued our talks with the Assistant Doctors Committee and have been positively approached by the Ministry of Health and other officials to their concerns about the Oversecuting Mission and Reporting.
Employers hoped that the continuation of positive communication regarding important issues - distribution, flexibility in education, additional education for those who interrupted their careers, mutual reconciliation on curriculum, education-based leave, and the continuation of positive communication with medicine, in accordance with the agreements reached with BMA in November, February and May, was a sign that the employers were taken seriously by the British Ministry of Medicine and the Ministry of Health.
The drug that can eliminate the danger of heart attack at a cost of 2x per day
Thousands of heart attacks patients will be able to benefit from a 2-cost drug per day after authorities recommend that they be given to more people for a longer time.
ticagrelor, which prevents clotting, reduces the risk of recurring crisis for people with heart disease.
The drug was administered for 12 months following a heart attack and reduced the risk of stroke or other crisis.
NHS observer, NICE, suggested that this be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS observer, NICE, suggested that this be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, around 140,000 people in England suffer from heart attacks, and a quarter of them suffer from another stroke or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fat substances and forming plaque on the arterial walls.
If the seal breaks down, this can cause a blood clot and prevent the blood leading to the heart, causing a heart attack.
And if the clot displaces, it progresses in the bloodstream, preventing blood flow to the brain, paralysis occurs.
People who have had a previous crisis are at a higher risk of having another crisis.
Created by UK firm AstraZeneca under the trade name Brilique, Ticagrelor reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of clots.
The NICE guide draft, published today, recommends that people be administered 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, and then administer 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director at the NICE health technology assessment center, said: "Although there are active secondary prevention treatments, about a quarter of those who have had a heart attack or stroke have another heart attack or stroke, and often their consequences are devastating."
Fear of relapse can have a very negative impact on one's quality of life.
Delillaries show that the use of ticagrelor with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of repeated heart attack and stroke in people who have had a heart attack before.
With the temporary recommendation of the tradegrelor, we are pleased to increase the treatment options offered to thousands of people waiting to benefit from this.
Since information over three years about the effectiveness and safety of Ticaglor is limited - at the risk of bleeding, the guidelines are not recommended after this period.
PC culture increases voting corruption in Muslim regions
Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was dismissed for corruption after a government report last year
As the destructive government report presented today shows, the culture of political truth has led to the ignorance of wide-ranging voting corruption in Muslim communities.
Former Cabinet Minister Sir Eric Pickles resuscitated police, election observers and the city court, as evidence of election abuse was ignored due to "excessive sensitivity to ethnicity and religion".
The former community secretary and today's anti-corruption czar, the religious intimacy of voters on religious grounds, said that police should be allowed to strip outside the voting booths to protect the feared voters.
He suggested voters keep their identities with them to prove their identity when they voted.
In the present situation, it is enough to tell the voter's name and address.
The report even recommends permanent inks being put in the finger during the voting process to prevent people from voting twice.
Sir Eric said that those who report should be protected better.
He called for better access to the Press on board documents and the decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.
"This is not only to provide protection against fraud in the elections, but also to protect the local government from the culture of corruption and fiscal fraud, which goes hand in hand with it," he said.
The report was prepared on the orders of Downing Street following Tower Hamlets' vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that mayor Lutfur Rahman would be removed from office after repeated corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman "abuses the religious feelings of the Muslim community" and silenced those who criticize him on charges of racism and Islamophobia.
It was stated that the Beneficent "the campaign was based on the basis that it was a religious duty for faithful Muslims to vote for him."
Up to 300 games were suspects, or the result of the use of fake IDs, the result of voting as if it were someone else.
Sir Eric has stated that there is evidence of fraud across the country.
He specifically warned about corruption in postal voting - where it was alleged that elderly members of the Muslim community were pressing for voting on their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric made some recommendations to regulate the voting system, including the identity of individuals to prove who they are
"Posses have been obtained that some ethnic minority communities have been pressured to vote on valuable individuals, especially women and young people, in Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities, in accordance with the will of the elderly.
"There were concerns that state institutions ignore such behavior due to "political truth" based on extreme sensitivity towards ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 proposals for the arrangement of the system, including the prevention of political activists from processing the voting documents by mail.
The report, reviewed by Theresa May, also calls for tightening registration checks to prevent the election log from being used for immigration and outreach corruption.
Considering the option to require voters to show identity before voting.
Permanent ink on the fingers of the person after voting to prevent any person from voting twice.
To conduct systematic checks on the nationality of the person to determine the suitability to vote.
Implementing a three-year limitation on requests for voting by automatic mail.
Prohibition of political campaign officials and activists from processing envelopes of the votes sent by the completed post and the votes sent by mail.
Allowing the police to move lanes around the voting booths.
The amendment of the law to facilitate the accusation of intimidation of people under the People's Representative Law of 1983.
Illegal taking photos in voting booths.
It is only a condition for English speaking in voting booths (except for Gis).
Strengthening the training of the staff on the sanction of the rule of voters entering the cabinet alone.
Sir Eric brutally criticized the Police Department, saying it was "interesting" that no charges were made in the Tower Hamlets case.
"The election court ruled that there is no place for charges against recurring corruption and illegal activities for Lutfur Rahman and his representative," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubts - according to the nature of the evidence.
He also criticised the "box marking checks" in the city hall's electoral registration departments.
Sir Eric said: "Tower Hamlets's court decision last year was a warning alarm.
Although our nation is proud to form the mother of parliaments, the spread of these alarming and secret election corruption and its rejection by some institutions can cause this good reputation to be damaged.
Being crazy for Kate's cyclist-like and other famous like Rio Olympic Players
This week, enthusiasts at the Rio 2016 Olympics have gone mad for French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who proved to be impressively similar to the Dusseller of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is not the only athlete to draw attention to his similarity to celebrities this summer while competing for the gold medal, at least that's what social media thinks.
Therefore, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces we saw on our screens, FEMAIL has prepared a list of Olympic athletes who look beyond reminiscent of Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: Brady Ellison (left), member of the US Men's Archery Team, has been interviewed by Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
In addition to Kate's analogy on the bike track, many online people have shown that an ostrich may be identical to Leonardo DiCaprio as twins.
Brady Ellison, a member of the U.S. Men's Archery Team, shook Twitter after his photographs appeared, which demonstrated his similarity to the star of the film Money Hunter.
And the archer noticed this madness on social media, admitting that he's been told he's looked like Leo since he was a kid.
Brady told the Huffington Post: 'I don't think there's a lot of resemblance, except for the hair and the beard.'
'He's a handsome man, so I think it's a compliment.'
There is another similarity, which is one of the most popular comparisons of London 2012, and undoubtedly will be even more noticeable this year: the incredible similarity of English long jumping athlete Greg Rutherford to popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her big and meaningful eyes, was said to be identical to Gloria Estefan, an American artist of Cuban origin.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been likened to Glee's star Matthew Morrison for years.
Change: This user states that Nathan's Beginner movie star is a 'atthletic version'
Tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett have been compared for a long time due to the similarity of his slurches and lips.
While the Russian team's silver- medalist has the same bronze skin and blond hair as actress Annalynne McCord, her fans say Nathan Adrian of the U.S. Team resembles the athletic version of "Joseph Gorgon Levitt."
Rough women: Football star Hope Solo (left) and Dexter's star Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eyes
Not alone: A Twitter user was very pleased that other people noticed this similarity
A theory left in the air: this user thinks there may be a reason behind this couple's similar appearance
A Twitter user brought his happiness to this site that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are twins."
In fact, the American football star and the actress who plays for Dexter has similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons include Kerri Walsh-Jennings and actress Laura Linney's almost identical smiles and other gold- medal-nail gymnast Gabby Douglas and the star of the Youth Fever, Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic announcer apologizes for commenting that the Chinese swimmer died like a 'pig'
Byron MacDonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's fourth place in the 4x200 m freestyle challenge has made CBC's live Olympic broadcast very angry at viewing Wednesday's live Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize for commenting that one of his announcers was "deleted away like a bad smell" by one of his announcers, the 14-year-old woman Chinese swimmer, and that he died like a pig in the race.
Spiker Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when the women began to explain their own ideas in the 4x200 m free relay round final.
MacDonald, who was included in CBC's announcer team to add 'color', was heard saying: 'The little Canadian, the 14-year-old little Chinese has failed, baby'.
He was too excited, he went away like a bad smell and died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) finished the second leg of the relay race for 1:57.79, allowing Canadians to close the gap between China, falling 1.61 seconds behind Canadians.
Canadian viewers quickly act after being surprised by the tone and language used
Emmett Macfarlane "Did the 911 announcer just say the 14-year-old swimmer died like a pig??? tweeted in the form.
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.'
Chinese Ai Yanhan, 4 x 200 m Free Flag Race described as: '14-year-old little Chinese heavy screwed up, baby.'
Criticals about Byron MacDonald were published on Twitter, and many of them were reporting themselves
Twitter users couldn't hold themselves when they heard how insensitive Byron Macdonald was
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and you make us all look racist.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who continued CBC's broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment: 'We apologize for the comment on the swimming race.'
These were really unfortunately chosen words, we're sorry that such an incident happened.'
CBC has to apologize at least 90 more times to tweet in response to commentary
Another announcer, Scott Russell, was forced to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC later copied and pasted this apology to over 90 Twitter users who subsequently communicated complaints about MacDonald's comments
The network quickly issued a statement, apologizing.
We would like to express our sincere regret that these statements have been made and that they have been published.
Last night, we quickly apologized to our viewers on the air, on social media, to our followers.
We would like to explain that Byron's comments were not about the swimmer's personality, but about his performance.
However, these were rather inappropriate and unfortunately selected words, and Byron is extremely upset by what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the air and attempted to defend his statement, saying he did not want to commit a personal attack.
"I want to apologize for a comment last night after the women's relay race," he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
'I was referring to the personality of the ring, but to its performance.'
'I don't need to say too much, I didn't mean to be disrespected, and I'm so sorry.'
Primark customer threw up anger at the woman who tried recklessly trying underwear in the middle of the store
Customers didn't know what to do when a woman took off her clothes to try panties in the store floor in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she looked at how it looked, pulled it out, and put it back on the shelf.
He kept looking, and then he tried four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone.
The place where the woman tried panties before she puts it back on the shelf was the Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone
Jenny Davidson, the mother of two children at the time, stated that she "redressed again after trying the underwear of the mystery woman and left the store without anything."
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
He stopped in the middle of the store and took a pantypture from the window, took off his pantyhose and pants and put on it.
'He didn't try to look for a special place to do it, he stood in the middle with all his disrespect.'
'When I was taking out the ador, everyone was looking at him, and it was clear that he didn't like the panties because he put it back on the shelf.'
He tried three more laundry until he decided he didn't like anything, and then he went out of the store dressed again.
'The people who watched him didn't seem to care, and he wasn't thinking about the person who would buy the panties he tried on him later.'
Mrs. Davidson (33), who lives in the town of Kent, said: "How disgusting it is to think that someone else is going to buy and go home with an uncleaned panties that someone else is wearing."
This happened Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: 'I think thePersonelin found the clothes after that came out and took them out of sale, which is a good thing.'
'When I went home with a new pair of panties, it would be terrible to think that someone else was wearing the panties and coming to me without washing."
A Primark spokesman said: 'Primark is aware of the incident at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday (August 9th).'
The related product has been removed from sale.
How to protect yourself from armed attacks with Krav Maga
The outside world is quite dangerous, but this video that Dailymail.com offers can help you to be safer.
To learn how to deal with the nearby-sacrifuating armed robbers, Rhon Mizrachi, the chief master of the New York-based Krav Maga Federation.
Whether you're approaching from the front or back, this video will show you how you can turn the situation against the robber.
Mizrachi says that when you approach you from behind, the first thing you have to do is turn your face and see the attacker and "past the fire line."
Then you will hit the gun in the face with your empty elbow by holding the gun between your front arm and your shoulder.
Then when you kneel to your groin, the assailant's pain will double, and at this stage you will turn the gun and take it from him, and you will hit his face with the gun's barrel, the back section will remain up.
When the gunman approaches from the front, a similar technique is applied; you pull your body from the line of fire, grasp the weapon and turn it into it so that the attacker cannot fire.
At the same time, you put your weight on the gun, punch the assailant from the chest area, turn the gun from him, and you pull the gun back at him.
Does it sound alengirli?
Check out the video to see how Mizrachi does this.
But remember, if you're not a Krav Maga master, the safest way to avoid every robbery will be to give your money to the robber.
Traveler Ian Wright put his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe for his travel guide
The English traveler has severely tested the immune system and gag reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The presenter and travel writer, Suffolklu Ian Wright (51) drove his tongue to a Euro banknote, a Piccadily Sirki railing, a flush button of a train toilet, and a pay phone in Russia to prove the power of the immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminoometer to show himself and what kind of work he was involved in.
However, the experiment, which will be transformed into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, has given some amazing results.
Although the idea of licking a flush button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely disgusting, there are actually a lot more bad bacteria in the kitchen sink.
During his trip to Europe, Mr. Wright met with doctors and medical professionals regarding the increase and health of stomach bacteria.
Fortunately, nothing he licked has had an effect except the bad taste he left in his mouth.
Mr. Wright was known for testing the endurance of his stomach by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This mission in a wide range, from general handrails at train stations to toilet flush buttons, has definitely tested the immune system
In the film about this, he said: "I haven't been very careful about my health since I was a child, and I've put a lot of things in my mouth, from soil to worms and muddy water."
During the film, he firmly proved the reason for this reputation.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
The resuscital sample showed a luminometer count of over 4000 units.
To compare, this number should be below 60 in newly washed hands.
But when the newly washed hands was below 60, the luminometer count was a Russian public toilet where he refused to lick when the luminometer counted above 4000 units
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy maker Valio produced the tour film The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places such as bathing
He said in the film: 'This is close to being one of the worst things I've ever smelled in a bathroom.'
Nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting in there.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as gastric bacteria and vitamins C and D, which helps strengthen the immune system.
Valio's Senior Vice President of the Department of Snacks, Fruit Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We really wanted to offer the consumers something new.
Something that is impressive to watch and also explains the benefits of probiotics.
We've finally had a lot of crazy brainstorming about "let's call Ian" come up.
They claim that interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put products a much larger bond; the importance of good and bad bacteria around us on a daily basis, the importance of stomach health and its connection with the immune system.
Interest in stomach health has become a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we would be able to give more interesting information to consumers about this situation.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "I will say so; I would have lost my respect for him if I licked some things I wanted to lick like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Although it was for Ian to lick some things naturally, some of them were quite difficult.
I'm glad we're recording some of these dirty licking.'
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 per cent of respondents reported that lactic acid bacteria associated lactic acid bacteria with stomach health, and 58 per cent said that they used products that contain lactic acid bacteria at least intermittently.
Maganda family destroy Saltash, Cornwall social housing before evacuation
A maganda family suffered damage worth 50,000 in the social housing where they were evicted on the grounds that they had scared their neighbors.
After several complaints against Tanya Skeldon and his wife, Shaun Trebilcock, Saltash was expelled from the residence in Cornwall.
When they were forced out of the property, the authorities of the housing association were amazed that the property was irreparable.
There were large holes in the walls, the floorboards were removed, garbage was scattered on the floor, and the walls were written in the wall.
The family has now been removed from the residence and are thought to benefit from special accommodation options
Donna McEvoy, director of Cornwall Housing Housing, said she feared that the situation would be unsaved.
He said: 'This is really a nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to take part in the account, because this property will now be known as an unpleasant part of Cornwall.
This family has a reputation and their names are a bad reputation.
The family had three sons who lived on the property from time to time, and according to the police, the family had adopted many frightening behaviors, including fighting a baseball bat on the street, scaring nearby residents, drug use, drug trafficking and excessive shouting, controversy and blasphemy.
In June, an antisocial behavior was made for Skeldon (47), which was named in the Kira contract.
Old garbage was found in many rooms of the house that was thought to be destroyed
The floorboards of the drug-selling property in the past were dislodged
Neighbors say they saw them fighting on the street and that the police were often searched
Cornwall Housing forced him and his wife out of the property this week after 11 weeks of extended their voluntary move.
The evacuation process was welcomed with joy by relaxed neighbors, who said their lives had turned into nightmares.
One person said, 'No one cares.'
We've lived with them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
You wouldn't believe how many times we've seen a cop here.
'This morning, we couldn't sleep.'
We woke up because it was too quiet; we're not used to it!
They're finally gone, and everything's gonna be great now.
Man Fitzpatrick, the neighbourhood sanctioner of Cornwall Housing, said the family did not cooperate with the local administration.
The family had been living in this house for 20 years and often called the police to the property
Garbage and old toys were thrown on the side of the social housing covered with plants
He added: 'It's really embarrassing that the car has not taken any responsibility for the evacuation itself and her family, and the evacuation has always been the last option Cornwall Housing has resorted to.
This was a very difficult case because the behaviors were extreme and their actions were frightening at the level that the neighbors should not witness.
I highly appreciate the efforts of my team, the Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, and the members of the bravely prominent community to inform us.
I hope that this development will be understood as a message that it will make the neighbors relax a little and that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Mr. Fitzpatrick said he had three sons who lived on property at different times, but they were in his 20s.
A dirty bed left on one of the bedrooms of the house after evacuation
Housing workers will need to clean up the garbage piles surrounding the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70 grams of marijuana, weighing, private items, and 1700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for selling.
He claimed that he would use the money to buy a tombstone for his son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being homeless, it was discovered that Tanya and her husband were now staying in a private residence in Plymouth.
Most of the houses had graffiti on the walls of the room.
Police say they will try to evacuate tenants who violate the rules of rent
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police Forces said the evacuation was also a warning for other tenants who continued to violate the rules.
He said, "This is a message for those who think that they can act as they wish without any accusations, and that their actions will be in vain."
Devon and Cornwall Police Forces, who will continue to work with their partners to protect society, will never tolerate crime and antisocial behavior.
Tourists in Portugal were terrified as the low-flying military plane passed over the beach
Tourists sunbathing in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced the shock of their lives
Portuguese air force flew P-3C Orion extremely low
The air force said it was a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
That's when tourists start to panic as they pass over the low-flyinged jet-filled beach.
Dramatic images show military aircraft approaching almost contact level to sunbathing on sand in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers stood up because they were clearly concerned about the noise of jet engines without seeing what was coming towards them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon near Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few holidaymakers who shared the video of the dramatic close flight on social media, said: "Twice he really went low and seemed to hit it at some point."
Nuno Arroja added: 'I was surfing, and I swear I felt like the plane was going to fall on me.'
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro, the plane coming out of the darkness was terrified when it began to fly at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats on the beach, and that it was the only way to control them, so it had to go so low.
The jet flew lower than usual, since the visibility was weak due to the smoke from the nearby fire, the air force insisted that no one's safety was compromised.
This summer, hard-to-extinguished fires greatly destroyed certain parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese air force said the pilot should fly low today due to conditions (intense fog and smoke caused by forced fires) that make vision difficult today
The aircraft was on training flight and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats
London girl student, who joined Daesh, was killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of the three British female students who left London to join Daesh last year, was reportedly dead in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that his family received information about his death in Raqqa, Syria a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the group is believed to have died in a Russian air strike in the country's strong-established Raqqa area.
Sultana was 17 years old and died when she was planning to escape the war-harvest country and return to Britain, according to her family.
"We hope that this will emphasize that going to war zones as a tombstone and will for others is truly risky and discouraged people to make this choice."
In February 2015, two female students from Sultana and eastern London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid says he won't give up Garland as a Supreme Court candidate if Clinton is elected
In the Senate, Democrats Leader Harry Reid said he believed that if Democrats' presidential candidate Hillary Clinton was elected president, he would nominate Judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court.
The Republicans in the Senate have been blocking Garland's approval since the moment President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell stated that the new president would choose the replacement of former Supreme Court Judge Antonin Scalia.
In a video talk Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland and "there are reasons for it."
Later, a spokesman for Reid said that he had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether he would nominate Garland and had speculated.
He praised Garland and stated that Clinton's team did not want to "disrupt the current situation" by making a new choice.
Garland, Columbia State, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals.
Reid stated that the Republicans, who prevented Garland from being nominated, were Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's "assetists" and "burners."
He stated that Trump was not eligible for the mission.
Treats says he's in favor of a naked calendar 'for men as well as for women'
Treats magazine works with photographer David Bellemere to publish a calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli for 2017.
But instead of famous and naked people, they are working to find new generation top models for the 2017 NU Inspiration Fairies.
The president of Treats, Steve Shaw, stated earlier this year that this magazine, which had a high nudity, was different from the old Playboys because "Playboy is for men."
I do it for women.
Obviously, he believes that the calendar is.
"We need to go back to displaying classical nudity, which is not out of fashion so that women can easily view these images of the female body as an inspiration," Shaw said in a press release on the calendar.
Since women are a beautiful work of art, they're going to want to be part of this project.
Models can send photos online or participate in open interviews in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl target: who really buys plaque?
Middle-aged, lonely men love vinile.
All LonesomeOlder Males Let us say that this statement is based on real data before going to the comment section to make great insults under the aruguity of no.
According to YouGov, the return of records, which is a very mentioned topic, is a result of middle-age nostalgia, not the generation Y, which is seeking innovation created by a physical object.
Recently purchased vinyl albums are mostly between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the 18-24 year-old group is the lowest.
This is also not only due to the act of accumulation of enthusiasts; it is of emotional importance; older vinyl buyers often love to keep their feelings (5.5%) (53%) and enjoy being alone (69%).
So are YouGov's results correct?
If this blog was news broadcast on television, the camera would watch on a crowded street of Soho's, walking in a modest gray suit, displaying many gestures before stopping, and saying something as authoritative like, "Let's take a look at it."
Then let's take a look.
While Soho gradually loses its center of its magic and unusual mood (the buildings where once independent sellers were located are now full of hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases) still have several specialized record shops.
I'd probably want him to stop from the camera for the next part, standing close to some of the different men in these stores, trying to learn about their age and emotional state through observation.
From Sister Ray (data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, possibly a woman in her 20s) from Glasgow, who I follow, spends the afternoon in London for a meeting and browses the shops to fill a few empty hours.
I'm asking if he's a collector.
"I think I am," he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These top-rated records (officially sent me by e-mail, I did not follow him home) decorate the walls of the living room.
The reason for collecting so many albums and singles is that it is partly a result of its expendable income; when it first comes out, it can get records that it can't afford and buy back what they sell in their young and broke time.
"Most of what I've received is what I've been getting at the end of the '60s in the '70s, and I'm only 11 or 12, and I'm too young to get it," he says.
He agrees that the producers of records are likely to be introverted people who like to be alone, and adds: "I do not drink cigarettes, I do not drink much alcohol.
That's my bad habit.
Wez (25) who works at Sister Ray also believes that most of the customers he encounters fits the YouGov profile.
However, he also realized that a new wave has emerged, affected by exaggerated advertisements in the media, and that people who have heard that fashion is coming back need to buy old records back.
In my interviews, I realized that normally in 1998 or 1999, people disposed of their collections.
Customers who sold their vinyls to buy CDs at first now sell their CDs to get the records back."
This can explain the increase of people of a certain age who revitalize the vinial.
What about the alleged emotional significance of records?
It takes a few seconds to realize that in a store like Phonica, record stores offer a comforting community of similar personality.
According to Wez, some older customers, especially offended by contactless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may want to seek refuge in the stability of familiar record covers, which are overwhelmed by the digital world and reminiscent of calm youth memories.
Wez says, "Sometimes this may be because filling a void or seeing material items as some kind of comfort."
Since I'm a collector myself, I have this, and I think most of them have.
It's an easy way to fill your head.
"We're like social servicemen," says a co-worker who jumped out of a pile of records.
A survey conducted in April revealed that 50% of the winners of vinyl albums have not yet been listening to the album.
The survey also found that 41% of them had a truck that they never used, and 7 percent bought vinyl, although they did not have a record player.
At this stage of the news, I would probably show an extremely anxious look when I was studying a number of bossa nova compositions.
The "reward" aspect of this return is also a noticeable element by Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of Universe (data three middle-aged men).
"Somedays, someone came to me and said, "I don't have a bullshit player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record to put it on our shelf."
Although this does not represent a large percentage, it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say, "I don't have a fake player."
These are not the elderly, the young, the ones who are in their late tens, who are newly engaged in this topic.
When I get to Fopp, which now has divided almost a whole floor for vinyl, I see that the mass is quite variable.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists taking pictures, young boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is spreading pop with sex content instead of less serene and calming jazz from speakers from the above-mentioned stores (the last piece of Wid Beast) is good to see the variety among customers.
None of them are particularly lonely, but it's hard to resolve the psychological traumas that disturb them by standing next to someone for more than 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) has been wandering around Fopp for a few minutes and browsing the records on the discount.
Instead of spending, he's only out to look at the windows.
He says he doesn't have the option to collect records because he doesn't make too much.
It's too costly.
It's easier to listen to music from the computer or in other ways, but the beauty of the viniline..." he walks away like a lover.
I don't know how to explain it, it's really nothing like it.
My last stop is a store that is said to inspire new generation vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm pretending to examine jeans, I'm observing a group of young girls gathered around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter's argument about buying a Crosley plaque player.
On the left, there is a stairwell full of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's records; a mixture of modern and classics for an average collection.
No one's looking; maybe it's just for decoration, some of them too high to be touched.
It's a purely artistic vinyl.
But curiosity about these items can mean that the industry will make more money and send fewer customers deep into Soho; there is not much to complain.
It is not surprising that a demographic group with more money and time than most spends more money on more luxury items such as vinyl.
However, my findings show that YouGov's results are at least true in Soho records stores; they do not take into account female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts who are in reality, record stores or online forums.
These people probably work very hard at school or office.
They certainly don't spend Thursday evenings in record stores on Berwick Street, studying records, and avoiding the looks of a 30-year-old fake television presenter staring over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don't know anything about it.
Greenland shark, the longest-lived vertebrate in the world - video news

French court rejects proposal for demolition of shops in Jungle refugee camp
A court in France rejected the offer by Calais officials to demolish dozens of shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During this week's court hearing, Calais officials argued that a total of 72 scrambled stores should be demolished, which the state sells many products, from cigarettes to energy drinks, makes haircuts, or for 50 cents (40p) tea or a few euros, and a total of 72 scrambled stores should be demolished.
The Governorate of Calais argued that these places should be demolished because they created a parallel economy without tax and posed risks in fire and hygiene.
The court said that stores and restaurants are vital, and free food offered by state-sponsored organizations and other groups is not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argued that shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
A court in Lille stated that there was no legal basis for deporting people who run the 72-assed store, but the concerns of the Governor of Calais were "totly understandable."
Judge Jean-FranÃ§ois Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants play a much greater role than just feeding people living in "extremely dangerous conditions."
He stated that these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places in danger of devastation, the non-profit Jungle Book Cafe for Children offers 200 meals every day, teaches English and French, where hundreds of underage refugees in the camp are given advice on asylum.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect this cafe for children.
A letter to the Guardian stated that the closure process would "a disaster for these children, some of whom are only eight years old."
The two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the population at the Jungle camp had risen over 9,000 (the highest number so far) after rising arrivals during the summer period.
After the gold in the Fiji master class, Britain satisfied with the silver medal at the rugby seven championship
Great Britain's impressive progress at the Rugby 7 Championship ended in the final Thursday with Fiji, following the 43-7 defeats at the Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji taught mastery of grip, pass, side step, support, running lines and muscle strength to win the first Olympic medal of all colors.
After defeat, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a not-so-stora consolation award, and may now be proud of their efforts in the Olympic 7 opening tournament, where they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
At the beginning of the day, the South African Team, which they defeated 7-5 in the semi-final, may have found them in the final.
But still, a Fiji, who was so fit, could have beaten a team of 15 people.
Although unbelievable, perhaps Great Britain may find consolation that at least one Britishman will be able to play the gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's chief coach, Ben Ryan, is an Englishman from Wimbledon.
This has been a very difficult journey for Great Britain.
Eight ways ago, when they worked with Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Seven Championships.
This time, they only lost one.
Although this defeat is painful, the progress is truly astonishing.
Fiji made a captivating start, the players squatted over Great Britain's attempts to take the ball.
It was like running between Captain Tom Mitchell and a series of moving buses for his team, and the World Series champions took the 5-0 lead when Osea Kolinisao took the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another right-wing curved number.
The match was 12-0, and Great Britain almost didn't touch the ball.
Mitchell's great intervention prevented Leone Nakarawa from throwing the third, like a mountain, but that was only delaying the number of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a right-hand corner, and Great Britain fell 17-0.
With only a minute left at the end of the first half, Nakarawa made another one consecutive.
Vatemo Ravouu then flew through some difficult British interventions to the line for the number.
With this number, the score reached 29-0 during the halftime.
When Fiji was a team set up to play in the 7th championship, Great Britain seemed to be trying to find out yet.
It's more or less like this.
Great Britain made major changes between the half and closed the Fiji dam for exactly four minutes, which was a good development for the first half until Josua Tuisova performed with the perfect Fiji play.
Dan Norton made a tryout for Great Britain, and tried to score from the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the fans of the game were in the hands of the South Sea Islands, who sang, waving and dancing.
It was really hard not to admire Fiji's cheerful approach from start to finish.
Maa Viliame also worshipped the final additions to the Fiji game, which did not need to decorate in the last minutes.
When the whistle rang, the Fijis began to celebrate, and Great Britain was defeated and headed for the locker room.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in the semi-finals, and Great Britain faced South Africa in a difficult semi-final match; Britain took the lead with a single issue.
Kyle Brown took the South Africa team in the first half, but Dan Norton took the lead in the second half with dizzying foot movements.
Anthony's brother Marcus Watson, who took part in the top 15 of England, won the victory and the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning, inspired by their coach's fight against cancer, competed in the spon
There will be no more emotional gold medal in these games, and that has a significant meaning.
After 220 inmates from the first move to the last, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning realized that the moment they earned gold at Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
Although there were two people who were rowing, there were three voices on the boat, and the voice of their coach Robin Williams was echoing on the boat as the first women in England to reach such a level this year in England, when they advanced to the second consecutive gold Olympic medal.
Their dominance was very clear, this was the 39th race of their unprecedented, undefeated series.
Although we see two wonderful athletes floating on the surface in the wheezing elegance, this image does not fully reflect the quality of victory.
Behind each shovel gold medal is a battalion of willing hands that make upcoming gains, and no hand was as effective as its coaches who knew whether to live to see this day when they were diagnosed with cancer 30 months ago.
As he said, they touched and left.
I've had the kind of bladder cancer that can be surgically intervened, and they did.
If they don't do this, it's going everywhere.
That would be a pretty bad situation.
That changes your view of life a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
Except for the season, he was very lucky to be able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, and in such cases it is not known if it will be the right statement, but in this way the distraction can be minimized.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better.
That was an incentive for me.
I was in the hospital, and even though they said I had a few steps, I was walking about 6, 9, 15 meters in the garden.
That's how it started.
Rowing is a journey on its own, but it makes it a little bigger.
After the victory, Williams was in his mind, who had spent a tense morning, talking a little more than ever to overcome his own concerns.
"I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe this is a little extreme, but it really means a lot," said Stanning, who was a captain of the Royal Artillery Association and had previously gone to Afghanistan.
This once again emphasizes what this means to me and how much Helen, me and Robin work.
I had three wonderful years with Helen and Robin.
If it wasn't for Robin, we wouldn't be either, so I'd like to thank him for being the best coach in the world.
I couldn't find a better person or a better coach to work with.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost the race in five years.
The two have achieved a difficult rhythm that their opponents cannot reach.
In the last 500 metres of New Zealand and Danish teams, Stanning and Glover's power had not yet been exhausted.
We lost that moment.
Helen was saying, "Watch the process, watch the process."
It's really important not to be taken away.
We had a good start, and we weren't trying to do anything incredible.
We weren't expecting the fireworks to go off today, we just wanted to win the race we started with a good shovel, which we did.
The two will take a year off before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding to attend next month, he and television adventurous Steve Backshall's wedding.
For now, he just wants to enjoy this moment.
I didn't mean to say this was my last race.
That would put too much pressure on you.
It took me six months to realize I'm an Olympic champion in London.
That was very new, and I was very stressed.
Here, this took about four minutes.
This is a much better feeling."

Bulgaria Announces Inflation Values for 8 Months
According to national statistics, monthly inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in June.
This is the highest value seen in years (since June 2012) but the first value seen above zero since October, after a positive value of 0.2% last year.
The average annual inflation measured by the CPI for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was 0.8% compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, meaning monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Since the beginning of the year, the inflation rate (July 2016 vs December 2015 comparison) difference was 0.2%, and the monthly inflation difference between July 2016 and July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, price increase was observed in the following consumer product groups: Food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transportation (1.8%), entertainment and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and shoes (2.2%), furniture, home equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%) and health groups (0.1%).
Alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; prices in communication and training groups remained at the same level.
Snapchat "Anime" Effect, Critical As Asian Cartoon
Although Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by animes, some observers say it's racial insensitivity.
Snapchat allows around 150 million users to play with their absurd level of identities by changing reality every day with its lens tool.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character ejected from a Roy Lichtenstein picture.
Lenses are reckless, feature-changing tools that create more than 30 million selfie developed every day.
The wrong steps are quickly excavated into the memory of the public.
Snapchat lenses had faced accusations in the past that the app supported black classification or presented whitened skin tones as beauty's ideals.
Therefore, this week's lenses, which make users slant eyes, broken teeth and swollen cheeks, some critics have criticized the company that is a "Asian mask" that cartoonizes Asians.
And they wondered if these recurring disputes pointed to a greater problem with diversity of the company.
News and anger spread on Wednesday with the news of The Verge and Motherboard, and a day later announced that it had removed the Snapchat feature.
The company made a statement: The lens was prepared not for the cartoonization of Asians, but for the anime characters.
But for observers with racism experience, this lens reminded them of the stereotypes that hurt.
Others generally refused anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student and tweeting about photos, said in an email that the lens was "a slightest expression painful and disturbing."
"He added that it is difficult to argue when it comes to a side-by-side comparison of the effects of the bad Asian cartoon and the effects of the filter.
This suggests that the filter is not only an Asian mask, but also an Asian mask at an insulting level.
Snapchat is not the only company that transcends cultural trigger mechanisms.
American culture seems to be in endless conflict over diversity and inclusion in many areas, from the chambers of association to Hollywood and the devices that we all carry in their hands.
And the wide young audience that Snapchat appeals to, which is more than its racial diversity, can also be interpreted as they may be in expectation of higher sensitivity.
"It is much more difficult for such movements to not be noticed as before," said 25-year-old Katie Zhu, in an interview Thursday, when one of Snapchat's lenses created a humiliating image for a user.
On Thursday, Ms. Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete its Snapchat account and called everyone in this direction.
In an article for Medium, and in an interview by phone, he said he believed that race-related conflicts reflect deficiencies in diversification practices at Snapchat.
Ms. Zhu criticized the company's leading team of white men, ending her article with a tag: #SnapchatiSilin.
"Although different races are not sufficiently diverse among its staff, they can make such decisions, or even though there are people who work there and belong to different races, they do not feel safe or comfortable enough to talk about themselves," said Mrs. Zhu, an American of Chinese origin.
Other observers share their views on this complaint, which Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not share figures on the diversity between its staff, highlighting the situation of private companies.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesman, the company incorporated a recruitment officer to internally increase its efforts to focus and incorporate into populations that were not recently represented at an adequate level.
Ms. Zhu, in her point of view, stated that it would keep the Snapchat account closed and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us who can say that this is not true."
Congress Panel Says Military Authorities Disrupt Daesh Intelligence
A July Thursday report said a congressional panel falsified intelligence reports by the United States Central Command officials to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.
An interim report by a working branch of the Palace's Armed Services Committee, Intelligence Committee and the Presidential Committee of the Defence Fund found that it was "a dissatisfaction" among Central Command intelligence analysts who said that the Supreme Forces had changed the evaluations of the Islamic State of America.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, is a military headquarters located in Tampa, Fla., which controls US military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence results approved by the leaders of the Senior Centcom leaders typically draw a more positive picture than the facts in the field of the United States' terrorism prevention efforts, and consistently provide far more positive results than the analysis of other elements of the intelligence community," the report said in a news bulletin on the report.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable; our fighter forces are suffering while poor analysis is being presented to senior decision-makers."
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
The 10-page report also gave details of the permanent problems in 2014 and 2015, which was included in the Central Command's statement and analysis of the US's efforts to train Iraqi forces.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that senior Obama administration officials have ordered the change of reports, it is explained that the analysts feel pressure from Centcom leaders to provide a more optimistic view of the threat posed by the Islamic State, also known as Daesh and ISIS.
"In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and congress statements were significantly more positive than actual events," the report said.
For example, a Centcom official stated that a major military attack for the retrieval of Mosul publicly could be carried out as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Mike Pompeo, Kansas's Republican Representative, said in a statement that "this issue was clearly understood after months of research."
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the United States's Central Command's most senior intelligence leaders manipulated the commander's intelligence results to be launched as insignificant to the threat posed by Daesh in Iraq.
After the Republicans expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State was manipulating, the Republicans formed a working arm.
As the investigations continue, the report published on Thursday will follow much more comprehensive findings.
There is also another Centcom intelligence investigation conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
The Democrats of the Palace Intelligence Committee also published their own findings on Thursday, which included some of the results of the Republican working force.
The Democratic President of the Committee, Representative Adam B. "At between 2014 and 2015, Schiff created a very narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments of Centcom, ISIS and the Iraqi Security Forces," Schiff said in a statement.
According to Mr. Schiff, this process "disappeared the publication of the intelligence results," which caused morale among analysts, and "didn't given enough room for mutual opinions."
However, Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that the White House had not reached a conclusion that the Centcom analysts had put pressure on fabricated the results of Centcom analysts.
The preliminary results of the congress review were announced by Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported a general review of a Pentagon inspector opened after complaints made by Centcom analysts.
As a Pentagon spokesman, Senior Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not comment on the congress report during the course of the general investigator's examination.
However, he said that "experts may disagree over the interpretation of complex data in some cases, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence support a healthy dialogue on these important national security issues."
The investigation will echo beyond the problem as to whether the US-led bombing operation in Iraq and Syria is ongoing (this is a argument that is being put forward by more and more defense officials).
However, last year's charges raised the question of how President Obama can trust the Central Command to assess the honest assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Critics of the reflection of Islamic State intelligence, Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker, President George W. Despite the objection of many analysts, the Bush administration began when he wrote an article that he advocated the possession of a small force in Iraq and that he did not think enough about the post-occurrence in 2003, and has been discussed for more than a decade.
Mr. Hooker also played an important role in the rebellion of Islamic State intelligence.
Officials said that the air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State, despite the other than public statements of the other year, had concluded that the terrorist group did not significantly affect its financial resources, as they had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
However, as the Times stated in September, this finding did not go outside the Central Command.
General Lloyd J, the commander of Centcom at the time. Last year, Austin III's statement in the Senate was criticized for viewed by many legislators as a very positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel.
US Women's Field Hockey Team, preparing to meet Britain, 4th in a row. Wins Your Victory
On Thursday, when Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, the United States scored the first two goals of the women's field hockey team in a 3-0 win over India.
Five goals in two matches seem to require a memorable craftsmanship, but Bam (27) said he was not sure if he had done the same thing before.
He said, "I have no idea."
I'm not the one who keeps track of your goals.
He knows: The Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament and share the first place in the group with Britain, who remained undefeated after defeating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Britain and the United States will face each other on Saturday for the final game of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarterfinals, and the match will determine who will finish the matches of the six-team group first and who will finish the second.
The team, which finished first in the group matches, will not face the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of another group when the quarterfinals begin, for a little longer.
After Saturday's match, however, the Americans made a sensation, making a surprising progress here after the last London Olympics, where they came last from the 12 teams.
Bam was on this team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pa.; he was 3 years old when he first picked up the field hockey stick (the twin sister was interested in this sport in Drexel) and became the youngest player of the team at the age of 16.
He missed the 2008 Olympics because he failed to qualify for the final squad.
It was later 2012 that most things did not go well for him and his teammates.
The following year, an English coach Craig Parnham was appointed and things began to change.
"A cultural change, a mental change, a physical change," Bam says.
We don't work like London anymore.
We've completely transformed.
Thursday night, Bam got the first issue of the first half with a close reverse hit.
India had not yet won the tournament, but the team managed to maintain the score 1-0 until the third quarter, with surprisingly resilience.
He made a long run from the left side of the field, and then he curled the ball and threw the ball at the goal, leading the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzales scored the last goal in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first match in which Jackie Briggs, the United States goalkeeper, did not score a goal in the tournament.
He's got a chance.
So is Bam.
Parnham said, "We're in a good place right now," but how good this place is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
Trampoline Reluctance in the Middle of Olympic ambition
No matter where you are, no matter what time it is, the Olympics continue.
The events in Rio de Janeiro represent an ambitious competition and work, and it's like it's never going to end or avoid.
The Olympic torch itself is like a blazing baton transmitted from the swimmer to the gymnast and the triathlonist.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos without hearing about the strife, you can't watch TV, read the newspaper, or you can't listen to what your neighbor says at a cafÃ©.
And Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who participated in the Olympics for the first time, can be one of the names shown during prime time hours, such as a swimmer, gymnast or fencer, among the sponsorships and TV commercials that advise you to feel good.
But Mr. Dooley (28) from Lake Forest, California, competes for the gold medal in the Olympic trampoline.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event at an equal level.
Far from the center, in partly unrecognizable spores in the shade are universally unrecognized: air rifle shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
The breaststroke will always be with us, and we wish it would be for a long time.
But personally, to express my favorite, I would like to point out the secret magic of trampoline.
Although he has been known as an Olympic event since 2000 when he was introduced in the trampoline Sydney games, very few people I've asked in the next 16 years did not realize that this was an Olympic sport.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes for the competition, it did not win any medals in its trampoline, and until 2012, there was no contestant who reached the finals.
The men's awards were inclined to share Chinese and Russians, while women were inclined to share the awards of Chinese and Canadians.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan of Canada will try to protect the gold medals they won in London this year.
However, trampoline stands out as a persecuted event, which may be partly considered worthy of clown school in unconscious ears rather than Olympics.
I have to admit, I'm not an expert here, I'm just interested in the matter.
It has a funny potential (such as cartoon-like tremor created by never ending a leap) but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, which are basically two sports that it combines.
The word "trackin" comes from the Spanish word hand trampolin, which means "tramplen."
Champions candidates jump almost 30 feet high from the air in a major trampoline, and they are asked to make a series of movements (burkma, pike and salto) before they land on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to execution, difficulty and "date of flight".
In Rio, thirty-two athletes will compete, 16 men and 16 women from 17 countries.
The most common progress in the Olympics is directly advanced.
Those who hope to receive medals should go further and downward, faster and higher in some cases, from going back and forth, up and down in some cases, in some cases, faster and higher.
They're not just looking for the finish line or the start wall, but there's another challenging line on television, the world or the Olympic record.
This determined effort is enough to drown even an audience in tears, at their noble, envy and even extreme levels.
But this is just the features I find lightly exhausting when watching the Games.
Trampoline allows you to take a break from all this.
The ones in the trampoline move up.
Their goal is not moving forward.
It jumps upwards, looks weightless like an astronaut, goes up, goes down and goes back up effortlessly.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty, but there is no feverish work to achieve the result during the routine period, there is no disappearance at a distance, just the elegant suspension of time and gravity, like a dream.
The more serene an Olympic race can be, the more serene it is.
The women's rankings and then finals will be held at 13.00 on Friday afternoon at 13.00; men are again at 13 on Saturday.
NBC will air the finals in the afternoon as 3:00 p.m. in the afternoon.
In the middle of the Olympic madness, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general brawl.
And consciousness According to The Wall Street Journal, if the United States male gymnasts recently suggested, if the United States will only increase by offering male athletes to strain and objectify the eyes, we can say that Mr. Dooley is waiting for new fans.
"A Generation Protest" in Ethiopia, which has been the US Allied for a long time
Violence protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced the government's fierce resistance.
Several protesters have suffered fatal gunshot wounds in a clash with police, the Witnesses say.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa and a solid ally for the West with its fast-growing economy.
However, the anti-government protests in the past months have spread to more and more and more regions, shaking the country.
Only last week, thousands of people went out on the street demanded basic political change.
According to human rights groups, the government's reaction to this was very cruel.
Witnesses said police officers shot and killed several unarmed demonstrators.
In recent images of protests thought to be late last year or earlier this year, security officials whipping young people who have to stick their hands against a wall.
The highest-level UN human rights official is now seeking a thorough examination.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country together, and it will be much more difficult to move forward," said Rashid Abdi, project director of the Somalia Peninsula project director of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
Ethiopia is one of the highest-population nations in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially Somalia, and there are very few countries in Africa that receive so much assistance from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing impressively.
Its infrastructure has been effectively improved; even a new suburban train is available in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy was not shown in Ethiopia (human rights groups are constantly referring to the government's repressive attitude) the internal opposition was very limited, and the opposition was effectively silenced.
Most of them were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or exiled to the farthest corners of the desert.
But this may be about to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from Middle Ethiopia, said, "If you drown people and give them no choice but to protest, these events will happen."
Youth is completely protested.
A generation of protests.
There are many complaints, from land to pressures by the ruling coalition on power.
After last year's highly criticised election, the ruling party and its allies took the last seat filled by the opposition, and now it is able to control 100 per cent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions on the border are rising with Eritrea, the pointed and controversial line that led to the war that killed hundreds of people in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, will be re-armed by taking advantage of this turbulence.
There are several factors that explain why the bitter feelings that have been boiling under the surface for years are erupting now.
The first one seems innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones became widespread and the internet service was provided, only a few years ago began communicating using a large number of Ethiopian social media.
Even when the government shut down access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often did during protest times, most people were able to communicate through internet proxy servers that hid their location.
Several young Ethiopians said they were gathered in this way for the protests.
Second, solidarity between the two major ethnic groups of Ethiopia, the Oromos and the Amharas, also increased.
The Oromos and Amharas are not normally allies.
For a long time, Amharas, one of Ethiopia's predominantly Christian territories, were highlighted in politics and business, exploiting Oromos, most of which were Muslims and appeared on plain lands.
But that's changing.
"We are gathering under an umbrella and moving towards co-operating," said Mulatu Gemechu, an Oromo leader.
The biggest protests were seen in Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo believe that Ethiopia was unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and is dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason behind unrest was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Former rebel leader, Mr. Meles, served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died of an undisclosed disease in 2012.
Seeing that not everyone could see, he was thought to be a tactical genius.
Analysts say he is particularly an expert in detecting the first signs of unrest and comforting and disabling opponents.
"The current regime does not have this basic knowledge," said Conflict analyst Mr. Abdi.
Hailemariam Desalegn, the new prime minister of Ethiopia, was elected in relative uncertainty to replace Mr. Meles.
Unlike Mr. Meles from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam is southern.
Analysts say he has not gained the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigraians.
As a result, more blood was shed with more fear.
Ethiopia's last experience in this kind of confusion was a protest by thousands of analysts in 2005 following the government's repellent election.
In the following measures, many protesters were killed, although less than last month, and this period of confusion was relatively faster.
Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for visionary infrastructure planning such as the new suburban train and significant advances in combating poverty.
However, this does not stop the increase of hatred for the Ethiopian government.
And it's becoming dangerous and ethnic.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amhara town, attacked businesses owned by the Tigraians, and Tigrayan hatred also increases on social media.
The protests have left the United States and other allies in the West in a strange situation, analysts say.
The U.S. government was using Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aerial vehicle flights over neighboring Somalia, but it was said to have recently been closed.
The West openly wants to support democracy, but it does not want its ally to be torn apart in a fragile region.
Mr. Abdi said "this" and added "like walking on a very thin rope."
Donald Trump Announces Obama's Allegation to Daesh as "Sponsorship"
Donald J. Trump tried to eliminate the recent conflict around the campaign, saying Friday several times last week, claiming that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
This statement raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate openly with the American people.
At the same time, he put a strange position in the process of trying to explain that this is not what he was implied by his deputies who did their best to defend him in the process of causing this.
After making this proposal at a rally Wednesday night, Mr. Trump insisted that he had actually implyed that the president and Mrs. Clinton had founded Daesh in the interviews by strengthening his thesis on Thursday.
In his post on Twitter early Friday, however, Mr. Trump said he was only making a cynical statement.
The post showed that Mr. Trump had completely backed down from a day before, when he stated in a series of interviews that he was serious about this charge.
Conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt reminded Mr. Obama that he wanted to destroy Daesh, saying that when he tried to help him soften this comment, the Republican presidential candidate did not believe it.
The latest confusion emerged as Mr. Trump tried to change the focus of his campaign after the decline in polls.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave conflicting speeches on economics in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump wanted to go back to this.
He also spoke on Twitter saying that Ms. Clinton's proposals would increase taxes and that she thought her speech was boring.
Mr. Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
Towards the end of July, after a look suggesting that the Russians would attack Ms. Clinton's e-mails, after being widely criticized, she explained these comments, "Of course I said that cynically."
This approach allows Mr. Trump to push the boundaries of political speech and step back where necessary.
Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language used by both candidates, said, "It is a scheme that allows certain messages to "explain" in some way, depending on the reaction, testing how specific messages reacted by supporters.
But at the same time, he gives these statements on purpose and knows that he is uncertain enough to be filtered from different lenses.
After the recent decline in polls, Mr. Trump adopted a much more aggressive attitude for the general election audience rather than softening the weather.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released on Friday showed that Mr. Trump was quite behind Mrs. Clinton in North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado, and that there was a tight race in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump often refrains from apologizing for the provocative things he said, he accuses critics of misleading his words or not understanding his humor.
However, Mr. Trump's jokes, whose comments are provocative, put his loyal supporters in the public position, who have been subjected to much more review in the last months of the presidential campaign.
Former New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, as one of Mr. Trump's most prominent supporters, did his best to defend the island in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think he's making a legitimate, political criticism," Mr. Giuliani said, when asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's thesis that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State.
From a point of view, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, those who found them cute were completely erroneous, and that was because of the withdrawal of the soldiers from Iraq.
Many prominent Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, where Ms. Clinton is the foreign minister, has failed to deal with the situation in the Middle East aggressively and has caused Daesh to grow.
Before the rallies in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continues to accuse news media over Twitter of twisting every word and biasing against him.
"They can't do this!" he mocked the "poor, pathetic" television experts who were trying to solve him.
Some Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's pretext, saying it was evidence that he was not in the presidency.
Once Once With Us at Cafe Greenpoint, Cannot Dealing With Prices
In Williamsburg, the old old cash-powered Verb Cafe did not offer a Wi-Fi connection, but it offered great coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, he couldn't cope with prices at his store on Bedford Avenue.
The store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soaps in the form of a cup of cake.
Residents complained that this was the last loss of the decent city.
The artist Molly Crabapple wrote this on Twitter. "New York is a change, but I still can't believe the CBGB is gone and the Chelsea Hotel has been evacuated and Verb is now a soap store."
But New York is the city of reinvention as well as change.
Last November, a renewed Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb Cafe has a Wi-Fi connection and accepts a credit card, but maintains some old employees and similar simple air.
Coffee's still good.
The new Verb is led by Cisco Rodriguez, the owner and general manager of the new cafe's long-term employee.
He joined Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When a client offered him funding for this new place, he said he would be thrilled to do so.
Mr. Rodriguez (36) left most of it the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for the bagites and purchased an espresso machine from the same model.
In fact, the lights of the old Verb were reused here.
But Mr. Rodriguez said he wanted to offer some different experiences.
He added new ingredients.
Bacon-eat-and-cheese sandwiches are available in the menu and ingredients such as capers and sautÃ©ed onions are also presented.
They have brown-brain bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer but offers fresh juices.
Nine months later, Mr. Rodriguez said he noticed that the old regulars were coming decisively.
"Many of our former clients couldn't handle the prices in Williamsburg," he said.
Last Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these clients.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lives in Williamsburg and often goes to Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he didn't stop moving on this road.
Verb said he took a break from coffee for a while after closing.
"I realized that what I loved was coffee and culture in Verb."
He started drinking coffee again, but the other day he chose the tea mixture, a new addition, instead of his usual iced coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another regular, has been to Verb regularly since 2003.
He goes there before work and always orders the same.
"Every day, I'd go in after seven, no wonder, and they'd make my order of butter bagels every day."
The photo said Mr. Rodriguez wanted to make a change and added new materials to the menu.
Nowadays, Mr. Rosenthal is still receiving his usual order, but sometimes he makes some changes by adding bacon, eggs and cheese to the bagel order of every day.
Mr. Rodriguez said he wasn't upset at the soap store that replaced the old place.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the coffee shop that was cold- brewed.
Mr. Rodriguez said, "I think we can still accept this offer."
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also embraced this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Mr. Rodriguez said that his new neighbors will find a space to show this menu soon to make them feel good.
The new location has other advantages.
The local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There is a possibility that the cafe will be expanded by spreading to the adjacent building.
For most customers, it is enough to even have a new Verb, where they can find their old favorites.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and he was very upset after the place was closed.
When the new place opened, Mr. Whitt said that he felt at home to go in and get coffee.
"I had to smell it," he said.
Depressive Eat of Crisis Time in the book "A Square Meal"
In March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat at lunch at the Oval Office, shortly after taking office.
President Roosevelt, a man of his throat, loved the food of the fancy Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras, and Maryland turtle soup.
The menu on that day was much more modest: boiled eggs with tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and plum pudding as dessert.
"This was an act of solidarity with those suffering from food," said Jane Ziegelman.
His wife Andrew Coe added: "This was also a message to the Americans about how to eat."
The couple in Brooklyn Heights, food historian.
Mr. Coe's latest book, "Chop Suey," was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Mrs. Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard," was talking about the lives of slums in the Lower East District through food.
"A Square Meal," which is the new book they work with and will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of American food during the Great Depression.
They also showed solidarity on food and met with a reporter for dinner at the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet in the Flatiron region, which has existed since 1929, the year the crisis began.
While Mrs. Ziegelman (54) ordered cream cheese and olive sandwiches, Mr. Coe (57), preferred to fit turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetables.
The couple found the reporter's order of rolls of meatballs appropriate for discussing Crisis-time dishes.
"The nuts were very popular," said Mrs. Ziegelman.
He had peanuts, liver nut, dried beans.
They were made of something cheap that spread the material with a material.
Imagine eating enough peanuts for you to have dinner.
Mr. Coe has made his face sour.
He said, "He must have been sitting in the stomach like a bullet."
In the years before the crisis, especially in rural areas, tables in America were like open buffets.
Women cooked for men working on the farm, and freshly cooked pies were served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
One. The Americans were sending food to the starving Europeans in World War II. "A Square Meal" explains the history of the methods of dealing with the nation suddenly becoming a center of abundance.
Mr. Coe explained the reason why he and his wife wanted to write about this issue, saying, "This was a time when food became a central, worrying issue for Americans."
The new budget regime was equally alarming: mysterious foods such as nuts and casseroles became the main consumption product, according to Ms. Ziegelman, "wectares were a great method for evaluating the remaining dishes," so cooks could hide the appetizers with a creamy sauce coating.
Fresh fruits were replaced by dried fruits, which were cheaper.
Over the years, meat at the center of American food has become a frugally shared luxury.
Interesting mixtures for calorie and nutritional value were tried and the feeling of satisfaction prevented the concept of taste or general culinary.
While researching for his book, which includes the recipes, Mrs. Ziegelman prepared an onion dish in the oven with peanut butter filled for that period.
"This wasn't a popular contribution to the dinner table," said Mr. Coe.
Mrs. Ziegelman supported this: "This was surreal."
Peanut butter has nothing in common with onions in the oven.
In most home economic recipes, this was a prominent feature.
From 1923 to 1943, home economic experts, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economy, directed the country's eating habits as never before.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to be "harpenulflu" and spread the struggle to turn slurries such as carrot cream spaghetti into delicious foods.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of delicious foods in history.
The government's responses to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's attitude, let alone a cake, are extremely appetizing.
On the one hand, he was praising the simple Iowa farmer's food to the public, while eating food, like a millionaire intellectual he had become.
"He liked to eat European cuisine delicacies, such as fish with salad dressing."
He was eating in a dining room, almost completely covered in gold, wearing jackets suitable for dinner.
It was far from the truth.
If his wife, Eleanor, did not encourage him to set an example with his stomach, President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake.
According to the book, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a helper who did not care about taste, and the White House began to offer not only "the most sad foods, but also the most gloomyly prepared dishes" at the White House.
After the country was back on its feet, most of the methods of cooking during the crisis were left aside.
According to Mrs. Ziegelman, the understanding focused on calories and nutrition and the way science is applied to cooking continues.
While writing the book, the couple stated that Mrs. Ziegelman's mother had learned a lot from her eating habits - for example, she could never throw the food away.
Mr. Coe said, "The waste of food really scared him."
Ms. Ziegelman told about her old memories: "He really made people sick."
There was a cream bun.
After the dishes were collected in Eisenberg, he and Mr. Coe removed a dessert they had prepared at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
Mrs. Ziegelman said, "This is called scrambled prunes," and added the most common number, giving these modest recipes a cool name.
There was no whipped cream; only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was hesitantly immersed in a brown sticky spoon.
Surprisingly, it wasn't so bad.
Mr. Coe has the second and third spoon.
Like someone who could be saving, he said to his wife, "Some chopped walnuts would be fine."
Gilead will receive lawyer fees in the fight against Merck and Hepatitis C patent
According to the U.S. regional judge's decision, Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to receive attorney's fees for the hepatitis C patent case conducted with pharmaceutical manufacturer Merck & Co Inc.
After finding out that US judge Merck had committed a number of misconduct, including perjury and other unethical practices, Gilead was dismissed from paying $200 million in compensation for the violation of Gilead's major successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, for the violation of two Merck patents related to Sovaldi and Harvoni.
During Thursday's hearing, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead had the right to be compensated for wages during the trial defense.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, the dominator of the market, with the next generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver patients.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming the right to property the laboratory work for sofosbuvir, the active substance of Gilead's medicines.
US-backed forces say Mebic's control is entirely taken from the Islamic State
On Friday, the group spokesman said the US-backed forces had taken full control of the city's city, near the border with Turkey, and the northern city of Membic.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDGs) are in the process of clearing the city after a group of militants are separated.
Sharfan Dervis of the Membic Military Council, which was allied with the SDG, told Routers that they had released over 2000 civilian hostages held by the militants.
He told Routers, "The city is now completely under our control but we are conducting cleaning work."
The Clinton family earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent federal taxes
On Friday, Hillary Clinton announced a 2015 tax return on Friday, showing that the Democrats' presidential candidate and his wife earned $10.75m last year and paid a 74.2 per cent federal tax.
In 2015, the Clinton family contributed $1 million to charities, most of which were Clinton's Foundation, earning about $5.3 million from the speech fees, and the former foreign minister declared that he had earned $3 million for his book, Simon & Schuster, in connection with his time at the State Department.
Clinton's candidate friend, U.S. Senator, Tim Kaine of Virginia, issued a 10-year tax return with his wife Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid 20.3% federal tax.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency," Clinton campaign official Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses for his promises to disclose his first tax returns and step back.
Although it does not require laws, it is a tradition for US presidential candidates to submit their tax returns publicly.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers stated that the reason for the publication of the statements was to be rejected was an audit conducted by the Revenue Administration.
In connection with the statements of the democratic candidate, Clinton campaign officer Ian Sams tweeted "You have the order."
On Thursday, Trump's special case deputy, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish them until the inspections are completed.
Criticising Trump, including Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, and other Republicans, the group said that this decline poses questions about its self-existence, contributions to charities, business agreements, and many other connections with Russia.
Clinton went on Friday by posting an online video showing that high-ranking Republicans were pushing Trump to disclose his taxes.
On Thursday, an economic speech in Michigan expressed the problem.
"For decades, he refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done, publish tax returns," he said to the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump had not paid almost any taxes for two years in the 1990s, and on Friday, a series of tax lawyers and accountants of the New York Times business department columnists shared his statements that the situation may still continue to continue.
Federal tax rates have become a major problem in the presidential election.
Clinton proposed a rule bid named after billionaire investor Warren Buffet, which will allow those who earn over $1 million a year to pay at least 30 per cent of taxes.
President Obama supports this proposal.
Last week, at a Clinton rally in Nebraska, Omaha, the Berkshire Hathaway group, who was operating there, challenged Trump to come and submit a tax return.
Buffet stated that he was also undergoing an IRS audit and that Trump was "afraided" from voters, not from the tax collection institution.
Clinton published tax returns until 2007 in his campaign.
The Clinton family, currently living in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of approximately 32 per cent between 2007 and 2014, and the unified tax rate reached about 40.5%.
The Clinton family's statement for 2015 shows that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income comes from wages.
Their main investment is a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clinton family declared that dividends and interest incomes amounted to $109.000.

Condoms with powdered red peppers, chestnut flares support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent elephants from entering human settlements; they throw condoms of powdered red peppers.
The method was proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation and the U.S.-based Union for the Protection of Nature, which came up a few years ago, took steps to promote this; in the villages in northern Tanzania, he began training volunteers to use the non-violent, four-step method of protecting their homes and crops without harming animals.
Previously, most people used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the preservation of animals.
"We have seen that since we have developed the tool set, our position in these communities has changed, they are more confident that they can keep elephants away from their lands without harming elephants," said Damian Bell, director of Honeyguide.
The first two steps include holding the net lantern and honking.
Where this is not possible, what is called "red pepper cloud" is thrown away.
The powdered red pepper mixed with the soil is put in condommask with a chestnut flare, only the tip is closed so that the fuse is left in the open.
When burned, the condom opens with an explosion and spreads red pepper in the air.
Even a breath is enough to send elephants in the opposite direction.
The last remedy is to use a catapult that throws fireworks into the air, causing a loud, bright explosion.
The Jewish filmmaker hit the hotel in Berlin, which removed Israel's phone code on the Arabs' "talebi" - RT News
A Jewish-American filmmaker caused sensations in the media after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin could not list the Israeli phone code and that the employee had proposed the "demands" of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, one of the authors of the documentary "Shoah" about the genocide, expressed his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German editorial organ FAZ.
In his stay, Lanzmann attempted to find Israel on the list of phone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not among the states that could be sought directly from the room.
In 2016, in Berlin, the new German capital, how can Israel be eliminated and destroyed?
Writes, Lanzmann.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to search Israel through its call center.
The filmmaker reported the situation to the hotel's reception for a statement.
Lanzmann wrote that his response "has shocked him."
The hotel's secretary stated that this measure was taken by "a deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski-Hotels."
The underlying reason for this movement has caused the filmmaker to become much more angry.
According to Lanzmann, the employee said, "Most of our guests wanted Arab and Israel's code deleted."
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, described it as a "great shame", according to Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were terrified and surprised by this situation.
This is a real shame.
It's a lot worse than this happened in Germany and in a hotel chain like this.
There's no need to explain that.
We expect the hotel to draw the necessary conclusion from this," he said.
The incident sparked a huge reaction online, which people described the situation as a scandal.
Some have accused the Kempinski Hotel of "subsecting" the so-called demands of their Arab customers.
Another post highlighted the fact that the hotel was located near a synagogue, on Kurfurstendamm street, saying "You must love."
According to Der Spiegel, the hotel quickly threw these accusations by saying that this was the result of "inconspicuous" and "shouldn" "sponsored" from Lanzmann.
One of Kempinski's representatives said, "There was never a direct order to keep Israel from being included in the quick search list," Suddeutsche Zeitung said.
And he said they've added the code.
Police use pepper spray and plastic bullets against Brazilian protesters
Students gathered in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday to protest against the government's reforms on the public education system, clashing with the police.
The police used pepper spray and plastic bullets against the protesters.
The problem began when law enforcement tried to dismantle the students, which led the police to use plastic bullets and pepper spray.
Hundreds of students participated in the demonstration to express their dissatisfaction with the plans.
According to the proposal of the governor of Sao Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, less than 100 public schools will be closed for savings, and 300,000 students will be distributed to other schools.
Some of the people who participated in the protest were seen writing on the walls against interim President Michel Temer.
This last protest took place a few days after protesters went out into mass streets to support President Dilma Rousseff, who was dismissed by the country's senate's vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased to 71% - RT Business
According to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, the abolition of sanctions and the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9% year by year.
Since the abolition of international sanctions against Iran, the interest of Russian companies engaged in business in the country has increased dramatically, he said.
While new companies are preparing to access the market, Russian companies maintain existing ties with Iran.
Of course, the further increase in trade is one of the main priorities of our bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Dzhagaryan.
In the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
In particular, Russia's exports to Iran increased by 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russia's imports from Iran increased by 16 per cent to $158m.
This increase in trade was achieved with consumables for machinery, ground vehicles and weapons."
Dzhagaryan is also waiting for a record number of Iranian tourists to come to Russia this year.
Last year, Russia's diplomatic mission in Iran issued 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of them for travel.
In addition, Iran was among the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia for the first time.
We can say that the Iranian tourist record, which visited last year's Russia, will be broken."
At the same time, relatively fewer Russians visit Iran, which is a matter that the envoy hopes for.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization are kept in good condition," he said.
Cash to FETÃ– from Izmir - Economy News
Interesting details about Abdullah Kavuk, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Kavuklar Group, and Ahmet KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kbay, Chairman of the Board of Directors of KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kbay Group, who were detained for providing financial support to FETÃ–, have begun to emerge.
FETÃ–'s financial resources number 1 and 2 in Izmir KÃ¼Ã§Ã¼kbay and Kavuk regularly sent a large amount of money to Fetullah GÃ¼len, the leader of the FETÃ–/PDY terrorist organization, with a large amount of couriers every month.
It was determined that the money sent to GÃ¼len to avoid the records was not deposited through the banks and that the organization was sent by couriers.
On the other hand, 9 people were arrested in Amasya as part of the investigation into the FETÃ– coup attempt, and 9 people were arrested and 7 people were released under judicial control.
30 thousand lira in pocket in 10 years
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's call for "download interest", the banks are on the move.
It was first proposed that banks be included in the campaign attack, which was started by Emlak Konut and then attended by GYODER.
The proposal was made by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to reduce the mortgage interest rates, which are considered as a psychological limit, to reduce the interest rates to less than 1 per cent.
13 banks have lowered their mortgage interest rates to less than 1 per cent.
There were public banks that started the discount spree.
Based on the monthly interest rates ranging from 1.12 per cent to 1.29 per cent, the consumer who used a 10-year mortgage will pay less interest than 15 to 30 billion TL.
PREFERENCE 5 DRUGS 10 YEARS
So how much advantage will interest discounts bring to home buyers?
A person who uses a 10-year loan of 100 thousand liras will provide an advantage of 30 thousand liras from the decrease in interest rate.
The vast majority of those who use mortgages choose the payment plan for a maturity of 5-10 years.
Interest rates are expected to drop further in the coming days.
The interest discount will also have a positive impact on sales.
In 2015, housing sales increased by 10.6 percent compared to the previous year, making it 1 million 289 thousand.
Sales are expected to exceed 1.5 million this year, with a discount on interest rates.
Aziz Torun, President of GYODER: It should be reduced to less than 9% annually
It's an important step for public banks to go for interest reductions.
They listened to our president's call and lowered the interest rates.
However, this rate should go below 9 per cent per year.
If this discount process continues, we are planning to extend the 0.70 interest campaign we started for several months.
Kuzu Group YKU Ã–zen Kuzu: Our campaign can be extended for 3 months
The fact that banks will participate in this initiative to bring vitality to the economy, which we limit as a month, may raise the extension of this historic campaign for at least 3-4 months.
Credit interest rates, however, need to be lower than 9 per cent year-on-year.
It is satisfactory to see that every sector makes the sacrifices in the housing purchase of citizens with the positive psychology and unprecedented solidarity that it will create in the housing sector alone in the real market.
Polat Holding YKB Adnan Polat: We expect full support from banks
It's a good step for our president to go to interest reductions on the call to the banks.
Apart from this, there are a number of steps taken to revive the economy in all sectors.
The campaigns made by NGOs, the Central Bank's decision and all the steps taken in this direction are for the country...
All the banks need to put their hands on it.
Come to them, and we say, "Come on this campaign, walk the same path with us, let's take the economy together, hand it to life."
TL 5.5 billion investment from SabancÄ± in 1.5 years
In the first 6 months of this year, SabancÄ± Holding increased its net profit by 11 percent compared to the same period last year to TRY 1 billion 353 million and its sales by 22 percent to TRY 17 billion 166 million.

Interest fell, house increased
My friend, the manager of a public bank, texted me.
It's always the same thing.
Interest is falling, house prices are rising.
Interest is rising, house prices are falling.
He says, "Look, that's what happened again."
It tells about the sensations that come to him because his job is about individual loans.
The contractors who entered the 0.70 interest rate campaign organized by Emlak Konut say that they have increased prices in many housing projects.
I checked to see if there was any truth.
There's a situation, there's no more...
In the meantime, I had a conversation with a contractor who attended the construction summit of our newspaper a week after the Fetullahist Terror Organization's July 15 coup attempt.
The boss of a big firm...
When I heard the word "In fact, you have to raise the prices by 10 percent," I said, "Are you going to do a counter opportunism?"
Following the coup attempt, with the campaign led by Emlak Konut, the constructioners started a big sales campaign with a maturity of 0.70 and a maturity of 120 months.
I admit, he put his hand under the stone before the banks, took the risk.
But if we are acting with the spirit of unity and unity, so as not to slow down Turkey's pace.
Banks also supported your 1-month campaign by lowering interest rates.
Then don't nobody do a raise opportunism.
And warn those who do it among you.
President ErdoÄŸan accepts Ã–mer KoÃ§ and Ali KoÃ§
President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan accepted KoÃ§, Chairman of KoÃ§ Holding Ã–mer Mehmet KoÃ§ and Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of KoÃ§ Holding and Ali KoÃ§, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Otosan.
Erdogan's acceptance, which was closed to the press at the Presidential Complex, lasted 40 minutes.
Call from BRSA: Complain those banks
Mehmet Ali Akben, President of the Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency (BRSA), made a statement on President ErdoÄŸan's warning to the banks "revoking credit."
"If banks turn the loan back to an opportunism due to the conditions of the market and do it with different reasons, we will definitely not allow it."
To those who bring such complaints and information to us, "As a name on the basis of the bank and the company, apply to the BRSA complaint line."
"I say that when interest rates fall and credit opportunities are expanded, a new era will be opened in front of both our country, investors and our banks," President Tayyip Erdogan warned the banks yesterday."
In this period of our country, let alone to refuse to lend, the banks that recall the loans with false excuses have determined a rank for themselves, and I would like to announce this.
When interest rates were 7-8 per cent per year, banks earned money from these jobs.
More than 500 thousand Russian tourists are expected
Ali KÄ±zÄ±ldaÄŸ, President of the Association of Professional Hotel Managers (POYD), stated that Turkey-Russia relations entered a positive route before the July 15 coup attempt, scheduled flights from Russia to Antalya started and there was a certain revival in tourism.
KÄ±zÄ±ldaÄŸ stated that the meeting of President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan and Russian President Vladimir Putin excited the tourism sector as well as the sectors that trade between the two countries. "I expect that there will be very positive developments for both tourism and agriculture to food, from construction to textiles for all sectors."
Turkey and Russia are two very close countries, we have years of traditional relations.
"I think that if we, as sectors, on this path opened by the leaders of the two countries, we can close the distances as soon as possible and go towards the targets," he said.
ReddaÄŸ said that they predicted that the number of Russian tourists coming to Turkey would exceed 1 million if it had not been for the coup attempt, and continued as follows:
But we lost a month in what we call the high season, so the target will shrink.
I still think if charter flights start, we'll exceed the figure of 500,000.
It may also be the end of the season, even until mid-November.
In such a case, additional flights can be placed towards New Year's Eve.
I'm guessing this positive weather will be well-estaved by the Russian people.
They also have a longing for Turkey.
With this momentum, I hope maybe we'll push the 700 grand.
Reddag said they are also hopeful for the Russian market for 2017, and said that if the relations between the two countries, as well as the Russian economy, the Russian economy recovers, the number of Russian tourists will again rise to more than 3 million next year.
POYD President KÄ±zÄ±ldaÄŸ stated that domestic reservations started small with the removal of the ban on permits of public personnel and said, "There are returns in the cancelled reservations and new reservations have started to be received."
"We have hopeful expectations about the Feast of Sacrifice," he said.
KÄ±zÄ±ldaÄŸ stated that the removal of the tour ticket sales ban imposed by Iran to travel agencies after the coup attempt was also a very positive development and said, "It would be very good if we could bring 100-200 thousand people from Iran in 1.2-2 months."
Should he renew the current loan?
First, contact the bank where you received a loan and find out how the new interest rates that have occurred affect your loan.
With the early closure of the loan (up to 1.5-2% of the generally used fee), calculate the cost of using a new loan with a lower interest rate from your bank.
If you are still advantageous when you include all costs, you can apply for low-interest loan use.
No breathing for the Lion!
The last champion, BeÅŸiktaÅŸ, aims to enter the new season with morale by winning the Super Cup match against Galatasaray.
Technical Director Åženol GÃ¼neÅŸ, who set up all his plans on the win, said in his meeting with his students, "We must play with the warehouse and aggressive."
"I expect high pass percentage and ball control for 90 minutes," he said.
It was learned that Åženol GÃ¼neÅŸ, who did not intend to drive the players who missed the trainings, especially Sosa, was undecided about Adriano and Quaresma.
The experienced trainer tried Necip in the stopper during the week's training sessions, but if Adriano plays in the left back, Tosic will serve in the stopper.
The Sun, which will also make a choice between Ricardo Quaresma and Kerim Frei, also had its students run a ball after a long break.

FETÃ– leader GÃ¼len's assets confiscated
In the indictment prepared by the Adana Chief Public Prosecutor's Office for Terrorism-Technical and Organized Crimes Investigation to provide financing to FETÃ–/PDY terrorist organization by ensuring the price of the immovables made in the irregularly amending the zoning plans and providing financing to the FETÃ–/PDY terrorist organization, the indictment prepared for the provision of financing to the FETÃ–/PDY terrorist organization. The High Criminal Court was sued.
Fetullah GÃ¼len, the number one defendant, was charged with "Initiating the Elimination of the Constitutional Order" and the court issued an arrest warrant against the defendants Ã–mer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were on the run with GÃ¼len.
However, the court has decided to carry out illegal proceedings for four fugitive defendants who have not yet been caught and have not been to trials.
Adana 2. The High Criminal Court then decided that Fetullah GÃ¼len, Ã–mer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in the foreign country in order to ensure that the case against them remained inconclusive and therefore were illegal, should confiscate all assets "in accordance with Article 278/1 of the Law on Criminal Procedures."
With this decision of the court, the immovables, land-marine and air transportation vehicles belonging to the fugitive defendants in Turkey, all kinds of rights and receivables, securities, share of the company with which they are partners, the available persons and bank accounts were frozen.
HÃ¼seyin GÃ¼lerce: The fall of GÃ¼len depends on the collapse of 3 feet
Commenting on FETÃ–'s coup attempt, HÃ¼seyin GÃ¼lerce made striking statements.
The lines of HÃ¼seyin GÃ¼lerce's statements are as follows:
As I thought they were going to attempt a coup, I wrote in my writings for the last 5-6 months, "they can't, but they can't do it in the chain of command."
I didn't know two things; the first one is that it's common and deep, for example, the eight-year commanding officer of the Gendarmerie General Commander and the aide of the President.
Mr. President, the most struggling person, who knows how he has taken care of, while choosing his aides, but the most important feature of them is unprecedented.
They're very hypocrites.
One of the most important evidence of the phrase "this is not the work that a retired preacher like FETÃ– can do" is that it is such a deep conspiracy.
He's definitely getting support from the CIA.
The CIA handed this person up too soon.
In 2014, Mahmut Ã–vÃ¼r said that in 1971, Fuat DoÄŸu met with Fetullah GÃ¼len at Vehbi KoÃ§'s house.
He says that the most interested in these things at the time is the period when relations between the MIT and the CIA were the closest.
The U.S. paid for our armed forces personnel's salary, and after we didn't remember them, there was one man like this.
When we learn that, 2014.
After Mahmut Bey's article, there was no explanation that denied it.
For example, Fair Orphan, he's caught on the base, right?
I wonder who that is.
The man went to Pennsylvania twice in the last 25 days before the coup, returned two days ago.
Adil Ã–ksÃ¼z has gone abroad 109 times since 2002.
When you put all this together, it has to be investigated that since Fetullah GÃ¼len went to the United States, which of them went to the United States on an excuse from March 1999, which of them had gone to the United States, which should be investigated.
It will be seen that they went to Pennsylvania on one occasion.
But their main contacts with the CIA can be identified here, especially from people who need to be upgraded from security, a lot of people have been sent to the United States safely.
Wikileaks is in his documents; GÃ¼len is building an association, and this association is holding joint meetings with the CIA.
15 years ago, there's been an effort to formally show those connections with the CIA.
I told you Fuat Avni was an intelligence pool in Pennsylvania, two years ago.
The man who works for the Prime Minister works for Fuat Avni.
But what's bad is that this information fell into the CIA just as it fell in Pennsylvania.
GÃ¼len's collapse depends on the collapse of three legs; one was the base, which we call the base, which we call the base, that there are those who are deeply hypnosis, and they say that even this coup attempt is still Erdogan's film.
I was talking about three feet, a base support.
Theft, theft, the defeat of the rights of the questions, has shaken up the sole support.
The other two legs; political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing that will break political support is the documenting that the tapes of Baykal and MHP executives were taken by FETÃ–.
After July 15, Mr. KÄ±lÄ±Ã§daroÄŸlu used "FETÃ–" and opened everyone's eyes.
Laughing is such a trick guy that he says, "I'm not doing it, I'm doing it."
He says with me, "Oh, Mr. Hussein, these girls are having very different dreams, they send it to me, I'm forbidden it now, because it's not right to do things with dreams."
A recording of voice fell, the person who spoke in that voice recording was Barbaros Kocakurt: My teacher friends dreamed, our Prophet double the tweets.
1 policeman killed in Nusaybin
According to reports, terrorists fired long-barrel guns at the armored vehicle, where police officers patrolled the Selahaddin Eyyubi Neighborhood.
In the first fire, a police officer was killed and a police officer was injured.
The two terrorists were neutralized in the clash after the police responded.
The injured police were taken to Nusaybin State Hospital.
Operations are under way in the area.
Shockers distracted TV broadcasts not interrupted
On the night of July 15, private televisions, which had an important role in preventing the coup attempt, continued broadcasting thanks to a technical staff who heroically resisted the coup d'Ã©tat in Turksat.
That's the hero AsÄ±m Akkaya...
Akkaya stated that they entered the psychology of resistance with the instructions for the interruption of the broadcast during the reading of the report on TRT and said, "I took everything to the risk of thinking that my friends were martyrs in the fire opened from the helicopter."
They wanted me to put a gun to my head and cut the feed.
I just turned off the local TVs.
Then I told them to get away from the building, saying we had to go to the dish antennas.
I spent about 20 minutes in the section where the antennas were located.
He said, "I've cut some wires here again, but I haven't touched the broadcasts."
When the coup d'Ã©tat failed to cut the broadcast in Turksat, he brought the experts of the Milky Way TV.
These terrorists were apprehended by the police who arrived at the scene three minutes ago.
Akkaya, who stated that he understood that TV broadcasts continued by phone about an hour after the coups returned to the building and that he was faced with death at that moment, explained his experiences as follows:
I took over the night shift at 8:00.
It was in our care.
My friend was on guard for the e-government and electrical system.
When we met for tea at 9:00 p.m., we flew low and helicopters passed us.
There were several other aircraft flying low again around the helicopter.
We've seen their lights.
It was probably unmanned aerial vehicles that could get footage.
They were flying in front of the helipcopters.
I've been there for 11 years, and I've been looking for the order because I've seen such a close flight for the first time.
Then a movement began.
We were looking at the news, and we found out the bridge was closed.
Meanwhile, our general manager instructed friends who weren't on duty in security to come to the building.
On the way to the order to get information, we found out that all the packages of all the broadcasts on TRT have fallen.
TRT broadcasting was interrupted for 5 minutes.
I called the main remote, but I couldn't reach it.
Our control station said that TRT broadcasts have come back and the paper has started to be read.
Halil YeÅŸilÃ§imen, Deputy General Manager, requested that TRT broadcasts be discontinued immediately with the instructions of the general manager.
TRT 3 made a wide broadcast on the channel, so we started to work to cut the broadcast.
We just heard Prime Minister Binali YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m say there's a "departure."
Our manager's 'termine TRT' order has put us in a little bit of resistance psychology.
We cut TRT, and after a while, we heard a helicopter.
We went out, the helicopter landed on the regiment, fired everywhere, everyone broke up.
We hid in a building back.
There were 12 of us.
When we got in the back, the soldiers who got off the helicopter came in.
The soldiers caught some of our friends.
So we came out so that we wouldn't leave them alone.
In the meantime, I saw them catch our deputy general manager and bring them to their knees.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
"Let's shoot one of them, let them be scared."
Then they put us all inside.
He started yelling at the commanders, "Who's in charge of this place, I'm not going to ask again."
When we heard the speeches of 'let's shoot someone', we thought: We don't know about the country, but there's been an instruction, 'Tele TRT'.
So there's resistance.
That's when I felt like I was giving up on my own life.
I said, "It's me."
I stood up at the time, never knowing what to do.
At that moment, all I could think about was that my helicopter shots fired at my friends in order.
I thought 10 or 15 of your friends were martyrs in Nizami, and when I thought, "They're going to kill us eventually," I got a comfort.
The commander in charge said, "You're going to cut all the broadcasts except TRT."
We have a system section that we monitored the local networks to satellite.
We're broadcasting 80 out of 200 local channels.
I thought of this room.
There were no national broadcasts between them.
If I cut these and tell them they've all been cut, at least until then, either support comes back from the outside.
Or I thought he'd go as far as he went.
After all, we agreed that we couldn't get out of there.
I said, "Okay, I'll cut it."
I cut off one of the local network packages from the antenna.
I cut off the power switch to the monitors we can monitor national channels.
So there was no signal on all the screens.
I told him I had to go to the antennas so it could be cut off.
The commander sent me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the soldiers said, "Stay there."
He put the gun to my forehead.
He said, "You're going to cut them all, except for TRT, there won't be any of you, I'm going to shoot one of you eventually, it's gonna be you."
And now that I'm sick of it, I said, "You'll see it when you want to, they'll all be frozen," and I didn't say anything else.
We went into the station, I slit the locals.
We're on the other antenna.
At that time, I had a system that would counter nearly 20 national channels.
When the locals were cut off, about 20 monitors were wasted.
My Lord has helped us not to be forced to answer, nor has He confined their testimony.
They believed in the answers we gave.
They didn't.
That's comforting us.
After they got out of the antenna, they asked where the transformer was.
I said, "I don't know, I'm a TV broadcaster," and he said, "Is there an electrician among you?"
I said, "No electrician after work tonight, no electricians, if there's a break, the team will come."
Actually, there was an electrician at the time.
It occurred to me that I didn't interrupt the Cyprus broadcasts.
I was thinking of cutting them off to stall the soldiers.
They're a little relieved that they thought the broadcasts had been interrupted.
They couldn't think to look at the publications.
Now the group's on hold.
About an hour later, when he turned on the TV in the waiting room, they saw the A News broadcast.
He's in, soldier.
'Commander A News hasn't interrupted the broadcast' he said.
We've made eye contact with the commander.
He said, "Stop the foot."
I'm up.
At that moment, a soldier said, "There are still ongoing publications."
He said, "There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus."
I said, "They're broadcasting through Cyprus, we can't do anything to them."
"Then he said, "After texting with someone, he lifted us all up and walk."
The coup d'Ã©tat escaped from Turksat in a van.
I saw the pictures of the soldier who took me to the bathroom and gave me water was executed in that van's seat.
They shot him three times, shot him in the forehead and cheeks.
My friends confirmed that he was the same soldier.
They were addressing that soldier with us as "children."
He's probably a soldier.
They could have executed him to get rid of him.
According to AsÄ±m Akkaya's statements, the first police team came to Turksat from GÃ¶lbaÅŸÄ±.
When police found out there were helicopters in the vicinity, the security guards were scanned, they returned to the county to pick up ammunition.
They came back after 40 minutes.
When police arrived, they could not see anyone in the Turksat's foreign order.
Explaining that only 3-4 minutes after the police, the so-called specialists sent from the Milky Way TV came to the building, Akkaya said, "They called the police teams from the inside, we are Turksat personnel, we need to enter urgently."
"When the police asked for ID, they all over their phones, all four of them hugged and told them we were caught in."
The spirit of DagkapÄ± after YenikapÄ±
The AK Party will launch a large delegation in Diyarbakir, Van and Mardin in early September, including businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders to build "voluntary bridges" with citizens in the region.
The AK Party is preparing to move the "YenikapÄ± spirit" formed by democratic seizures to DiyarbakÄ±r following the bloody coup attempt of the FETÃ–/PDY's junta.
The mayors of the CHP and MHP will also be invited to the relief campaign to be held in the Eastern and Southeastern Anatolia regions prior to the Feast of Sacrifice.
The AK Party, which will give the message to the people of the region "State and the nation with you," will provide assistance to poor families and needy people.
The last meeting of the AK Party's MYK meeting was discussed for the first time in the month of Ramadan.
The meeting, which evaluated the positive results of the project for families in need, especially young people and children in the region, was evaluated and it was decided to continue the GÃ¶nÃ¼l Bridge on Eid al-Adha.
The work started under the chairmanship of Mehmet MÃ¼ezzinoÄŸlu, Vice-President and President of Civil Society Public Relations.
Accordingly, 12 provinces in the East and Southeast will meet in Diyarbakir, Mardin and Van.
Meetings will be held in these 3 provinces, which are accepted from the center.
Businessmen, artists, athletes and opinion leaders will also participate in the events.
In these meetings, the organization of aids and works will be discussed.
On the Feast of Sacrifice, delegations of famous names will personally deliver the aid to the citizens.
Children and children will be given holiday allowance, and school needs will be met in this way as schools are opened after the holidays.
Sacrifice meat will be distributed to the needy.
After July 15th, the national unity atmosphere between the AK Party, the CHP and the MHP against the coup will be reflected in this project.
CHP and MHP provincial presidents of 12 provinces, including the project, will also be invited to the organizations.
The three parties will be encouraging the relief activities together.
It is considered that HDP will not be invited to the events as in YenikapÄ±.
Adil Ã–ksÃ¼z's father-in-law spoke
FETÃ–'cÃ¼ Adil Ã–ksÃ¼z, who was shown as the number 1 of the July 15 coup attempt, along with his father-in-law, was detained and transferred to the courthouse.
Father-in-law Cevat YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m and Hatice YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m, mother-in-law, were released on the condition of judicial control and a ban on leaving abroad.
Speaking at the exit of the courthouse, Cevat YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m called for his son-in-law to surrender: "I am with the state."
God damn the coup d'Ã©tats.
I didn't really recognize the Adil Orphan I've known for 18 years.
I don't have a son-in-law named Fair Orphan.
I want him caught as soon as possible.
In this way, he can neither live in Turkey nor live in the world.
Let him come, trust the Turkish justice.
If he's made a mistake, he'll pay for it
It's a problem with running away.
Shame on the police, it's a shame about the state.
For 20, 25 days, the police have been doing nothing else.
"We need to work, not the coup," Yildirim said, stating that he does not want Turkey to return to Syria.
We don't want Turkey to go and be like Syria.
Syria had a neighbour like Turkey.
There's a president like Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
He said, "What do we do with the coup?"
On the other hand, Ã–ksÃ¼z, who was last seen passing through the TEM Highway AkyazÄ± tolls at 03.00 on July 19, disappeared after leaving his 'SIR' license plate car in AkyazÄ±''s garage.

Sees the plot in Ergenekon, FETÃ– kills
The Ankara Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating the role of FETÃ– in the mysterious death of BehÃ§et Oktay, Head of Special Operations Department, whose file was closed in 2009, "He committed suicide."
Ramadan AkyÃ¼rek, the head of the former Chief of Security Intelligence, who was in the same accommodation as Oktay and who listened to Oktay as a suspect in the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization six days before he died, is the main suspect in the investigation.
Some of the ammunition seized as part of the Ergenekon investigation was stolen and buried by the security FETÃ– team from the Special Operations Agency, which is said to have been killed because Oktay had identified it.
The death of BehÃ§et Oktay, the head of the Special Operations Department of the period, who was shot in the head in Ankara on 25 February 2009, was called "suicide."
But there were many question marks in the case.
As a result of the legal struggle and evidence of his family and family lawyers, two years later, a murder investigation was opened this time.
The gun that was said to have shot him was in his right hand with the left-hand Oktay.
He also had fractures in the ribs and blunt force trauma on his body.
The case in connection with the murder investigation was filed in May 2012.
In the murder case, only Halil Cutter, who was present at the time of his death, was tried.
The cutter was acquitted at the end of the trial.
Nurhan Ã–nder, who was in prison for another crime and sent a letter to the prosecutor's office, saying that he was involved in Oktay's death, was sentenced to six months in prison for "criminalization and misleading judicial authorities."
O DEFENSES INQUIRE
Prosecutor HÃ¼seyin YalÃ§Ä±n, who said "suicide" to the incident, was retired, while Mustafa DÃ¼zgÃ¼n, who conducted the murder investigation, was promoted to the Court of Cassation.
The Oktay family wants these prosecutors to be investigated as well as the autopsy prosecutor Nihat YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m.
BehÃ§et Oktay's sister Åžule Oktay and her brother Nezih Oktay and family lawyers made many requests during the trial.
The family said it was impossible for Halil Cutter to kill the specially trained Oktay alone, and asked for the investigation to be expanded.
The family, who said that the incident was covered, asked the prosecutors HÃ¼seyin YalÃ§Ä±n and Mustafa DÃ¼zgÃ¼n and BehÃ§et Oktay to be identified and tried by law enforcement officers who wanted to cover the case as suicide.
While all the demands of the family were rejected, it was revealed that Oktay was heard six days before his death under the false name "Abdurrahman DoÄŸru" as a member of the Hezbollah Terrorist Organization.
It was determined that the person who had the listener was Ramazan AkyÃ¼rek, the head of the Security Intelligence Department at the time.
As a result of this development, the Ankara Chief Public Prosecutor's Office, which reconsidered the BehÃ§et Oktay case, began to examine the finger of the Fetullahist Terror Organization (FETÃ–) in the murder.
The case against Oktay's illegal hearing at the Ankara High Criminal Court will begin on September 19th.
THERE IS FETÃ– IN THE BETWEEN
The Oktay family, whom SABAH interviewed, is hopeful of the current investigation.
Family members say the FETÃ– finger in the murder was covered up during a previous demonstration investigation and trial.
"This murder has actually come to show off."
We couldn't detect it.
My brother said he'd eat me before he was killed.
I said, "Who."
That's when he pointed to FETÃ–.
I thought he'd be relieved of duty.
I never thought of death.
Of course, FETÃ– is behind this.
"The administration was in their hands at the time," he said.
The martyr called the young man's family, attended his prayer
President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called the family of the university's university, the university's university, through NazÄ±m MaviÅŸ, AK Party Sinop deputy, after addressing citizens in the last watch of democracy in the last watch of the previous evening.
"Our President also attended with his prayers," said Fahrettin AÃ§Ä±kgÃ¶z, the father, who stated that the phone was made when they prayed for his son at 1:30 a.m.
"I said that our country and its health is important to us," he said.
'My data is IMPORTANT FOR US'
The previous evening, President ErdoÄŸan addressed the citizens in front of the Presidential Complex.
Erdogan met with some citizens in KÃ¼lliye after his speech, which ended in the middle of the night.
Tayyip Erdogan, who walked together by holding the hand of an elderly aunt who came to the democracy watch, talked to the citizens one by one, took care of the children, and thanked the citizens for their sacrifice.
Erdogan then called Fahrettin AÃ§Ä±kgÃ¶z, the father of July 15th martyr Ã–mer Can AÃ§Ä±kgÃ¶z, through the AK Party's Sinop MP NazÄ±m MaviÅŸ.
Fahrettin AÃ§Ä±kgÃ¶z, the father of 21-year-old Ã–mer Can, a student of TOBB University Faculty of Law, who was shot in front of the Presidential Complex, said that President ErdoÄŸan called while praying for his son at 01.30 at night and said, "When I said we were praying for my son, our President also attended with his prayers."
So I said that our country's health and its health is very important to us.
"We are very pleased that our President called and prayed on the phone," he said.
FETÃ–'s pyramid was destroyed
26 FETÃ–'s arrests were arrested in Izmir Urla.
Among the arrested are the "invaluation" within the organization, in line with the statements of the victims, and the Liberation Naip HepyalÃ§Ä±n, who threatens those who want to end the subscription to the Zaman newspaper.
FETÃ–'s ten-a-year-old sister was arrested in UÅŸak.
24 people, including former Bursa Police Commissioner Ali Osman Kahya, were transferred to the courthouse in Bursa.

The traitor who shot the public was protecting the PKK
Turkey, which has been fighting relentlessly to end PKK terrorism for more than forty years, has begun to emerge in its struggle for why it has not been able to destroy its leaders.
FETÃ– militants, who have infiltrated Turkey's critical institutions, worked on four sides to bind Turkey's hand.
At this point today, serious suspicions and evidence of FETÃ– has begun to emerge, which is behind critical events such as the Hrant Dink Murder, the Uludere incident, the fall of the Russian plane.
NO REGULATION MULTI
During the July 15 coup attempt, it was revealed that the record of FETÃ–'cÃ¼ Brigadier General GÃ¶khan Åžahin SÃ¶nmezateÅŸ, who led the raid and assassination operation of President Tayyip ErdoÄŸan's hotel in Marmaris, was very large.
Previously, it was determined that SÃ¶nmezateÅŸ had reported the air operations to the PKK to the terrorists while the planes were taking off.
In the research conducted by the intelligence units, it was determined that GÃ¶khan SÃ¶nmezateÅŸ's record was fluffy.
TERRORISTS PROTECTED
In addition to leaking intelligence to the PKK, Turkish fighters did not hit the designated targets.
The point given by the MIT on the PKK's leadership staff at the foot of Kandil was allegedly deflected by GÃ¶khan SÃ¶nmezateÅŸ and prevented the shooting of targets.
With the change of coordinates, it was determined that the fighter planes that took off to destroy the PKK's leading staff hit the sides of the targets, and that the leaders of the terrorist organization were thus saved.
Intelligence review revealed that SÃ¶nmezateÅŸ played a key role in both deflection of targets and in the escape of PKK terrorists without taking off the F-16s.
Files of 37,000 officers are being filed
The restructuring process was initiated in the Turkish Armed Forces and the Ministry of National Defense after the coup attempt of FETÃ– members under the direction of Fetullah GÃ¼len, the head of the terrorist terrorists.
A comprehensive cleaning process was initiated, especially when it was understood that the questions of entering military high schools were stolen by FETÃ– and that military students who were not members of the organization were intimidated and sent from schools.
With the recent exports, about 37,000 officers remain from 39,287 officers, while the cleanliness for the generals and the admirals will be carried out for these officers.
For this, promotions will be frozen, especially in the staff from the lieutenants to the rank of colonel.
A thorough investigation will be completed before the promotion.
The files of 37,000 officers began to be opened one by one.
With a hard work, FETÃ– soldiers will be uncovered.
Officers who are not affiliated with FETÃ– will continue their duties.
The fight will continue until the last FETÃ–'s cleared of the army, while the promotion of the officers will only come up after the investigation.
The investigation is carried out by the MIT, the Security Intelligence and the State Supervisory Board.
As part of the investigation, the officers whose files were filed are being investigated whether they have received ranks, promotions, places of duty and their commanders by finishing the civilian or war school.
It will also be investigated for a haircut, even through the arrangements, whether they are members of FETÃ–.
All measures will be taken to ensure that the officers who have no connection with FETÃ– will not be adversely affected by the process.
If there's any doubt, that officer will be suspended immediately and transferred to the judiciary.
Those who have been identified with FETÃ–, who have information and documents about them, will be discontinued with the army immediately.
During all these procedures, the review will be deepened while the promotions are frozen.
Necessary measures will also be taken to prevent gaps in the cadres after the exports.
Those who are expelled from the Turkish Armed Forces with the FETÃ– plot and those who have been forced to retire will be able to return to their professions with the same personal rights in the equivalent staff and circuit friends after passing the security investigation.
2 THOUSAND 133 SUBAY EXPORT
The General Staff announced the number of personnel of the Turkish Armed Forces on 1 July as 39,287 officers.
The majority of the 32,289 officers in the officer class, consisting of Lieutenant Lieutenant, captain, major, commander, colonels and colonels, were in charge of the Land, Air and Naval forces.
However, the first wave of 27 July exports were dismissed, including 726 Land, 314 in Air and 59 in the Naval Forces.

PehlivanoÄŸlu: FETÃ– poisoned TÃ¼rkeÅŸ
Retired Superintendent Tahsin Pehlivanoglu, one of the protections of Alparslan TÃ¼rkeÅŸ, the founder and first leader of the MHP, claimed that Turkes was poisoned and that one of the family members was involved in co-operation with FETÃ–.
PehlivanoÄŸlu, who was with TÃ¼rkeÅŸ at all times from 1977 to 1997, said, "I have not told anyone until today, but I had to talk after I watched the image of the soldier that had taken out of Muhsin YazÄ±cÄ±oÄŸlu's helicopter and saw that the same soldier was inside the coup d'Ã©tats assigned to kill our President."
Here's what Turkes's bodyguard said:
We went to Germany in 1997.
We had a check-up on the head three days before we came in.
"You're like an 18-year-old boy."
"You have nothing," he said.
This doctor died of a heart attack a month later.
We returned to Ankara on April 3rd.
My chief went to Amasya.
They called me on the way back and went to an engagement at the Ankara Hilton.
After leaving the engagement, TÃ¼rkeÅŸ driver says to Alparslan, "Open the back window."
He wouldn't have opened windows.
When I open the window, it sounds like a slob.
First they performed CPR and electro at Ã‡ankaya Medical Center, but they were finished.
We took him to the BayÄ±ndÄ±r Medical Center together, but it was too late.
I think someone in the family poisoned it in Amasya.
There was no autopsy on Turkes.
His ex-husband, Seval TÃ¼rkeÅŸ, will have heard about my discomfort and my rhetoric, and he made statements that he appeared and defended as "TurkeÅŸ was killed."
Man builds a conquest, he opens graves.
They said a heart attack.
Turkes's tomb must be reopened.
Alparslan TÃ¼rkeÅŸ was killed?

7.2 magnitude earthquake in the Pacific
The U.S. Geological Research Center (USGS) reported that the earthquake, 109 kilometers east of New Caledonia Island, was recorded at a depth of 10 kilometers from the seabed.
The tsunami warning after the earthquake, which did not cause loss of life and property, was cancelled shortly after.

Unbeknownst to the coup, he prayed for martyrdom
Cetin Can, 38, who was martyred on the Bosphorus Bridge on the night of July 15th, maintains their strength.
His wife Fatma Can said that while they had not yet known about the coup attempt, her husband had learned the "speaking prayer of martyrdom in the month of Åževval" in a conversation, so he had prayed at home and advised him to perform this prayer.
Fatma Can, who reported that they watched the news on TV in the evening after the prayer and learned about the coup attempt, said:
We got ready and left together.
When we got to the bridge, there were people waiting there.
As soon as we got into the bridge, the tank fired on us twice.
We took trenches, then we kept walking when the tank went.
There was a big bus on the bridge.
It was too crowded there.
We stopped there for a while, waited.
When we couldn't move on, we thought about what to do.
Cetin wanted us to cross the sidelines.
When we got to the side lane, I'm guessing it was a sniper, we were an open target, and he was shot there.
Four hours after he had prayed, he prayed and became a martyr.
He didn't know about the coup.
A wisdom of God...
Allah is the Almighty, the Almighty.
My wife said before, "If I die, plant a tree that bears fruit to my grave."
I made this wish by planting plum trees on the head of his grave.
Fatma Can noted that they owed thanks to President ErdoÄŸan for visiting them, and said, "God bless him."

His brother HÃ¼seyin S., who was considered to have helped Ali Kemal S. in connection with the murder and gave contradictory statements in the police. (42) was arrested.
The suspect, Ali Kemal S., disappeared in Germany where he lived after Winkler's body was discovered.
Hamm Chief Prosecutor General reported that Ali Kemal S., wanted by Interpol in 190 countries, was caught walking down the street and did not resist the police.
The German Prosecutor General has yet to determine where the indictee has been hiding, and that the extradition process to Turkey can also be found for 4 months.
On the night of July 15th, it was revealed that FETÃ–'cÃ¼ coup d'Ã©tats shot at the mosque next to AkÄ±ncÄ± Base to silence the sala.
SABAH reached out to the statement given by the Imam of the mosque with the images of the attack on the TAI TUSAÅž Mosque, which is the closest mosque to AkÄ±ncÄ± Base.
According to reports, the strikers began shooting at the glass shortly after the raft was read at the mosque, targeting directly at the speaker from a distance of about 50 meters.
One of the bullets hit the side of the speaker four times the glory.
When the impactors failed to hit the speaker, the sala from the central system was read to the end.
According to the crime scene reports, the coup d'Ã©tats broke through the door of the mosque with the intention of killing the imam and walking in with their postals.
"I have not been injured personally, but I do not have any complaints, but I want these criminals who can shoot at the mosque and martyr the people of Kazan to be punished in the most severe way."
Young people killed drugs at the festival
At last week's youth festival in SarÄ±yer, Istanbul, 2 out of 5 people who were hospitalized were killed.
According to reports, 5 of the participants of a youth festival in BahÃ§ekÃ¶y on 6 August were hospitalized.
Tugay Ergin (19) and GÃ¶khan AlataÅŸ (19) died.
The treatment of 3 people continues.
Police have detained five people who allegedly sold drug pills to young people attending the festival.
Three of the five suspects who were transferred to the courthouse following their police procedures were arrested and 2 were released for trial without arrest.
Research on the cause of death of young people is also under way.
In the Burhaniye district of BalÄ±kesir, two of the six young people who camped and used drugs by setting up tents by the coast collapsed.
The U.S., and G.C., who were taken to the hospital, died.
The other four young people were taken to the police department for their statements after their treatment.
He detonated a bomb in front of his wife's house where he lived apart
M.Y., 41, who lives in Bursa, detonated the handmade grenade, which he left the house about 8-9 months ago due to severe discord, and he made with his own effort in front of the house he rented and filled the nail with a marble and increased the force of the blow.
As citizens experienced fear and panic due to the explosion last night, the pieces of the ball and nails in the device scattered around the environment, causing the windows of many houses to break.
Anti-terrorism teams have initiated efforts to apprehend the M.Y. who escaped after the incident and was said to be unemployed.
Neighborhood residents said that the woman left home about a month ago due to the pressures of her husband and settled in the shelter.
Explosion in prison in the Philippines: 10 dead
Senior investigator Xavier Solda, spokesman for the Prison Administration and Penology Bureau, said that 10 Chinese prisoners were killed in an unidentified explosion at Paranaque Prison in Manila.
"We confirmed that there was an explosion inside in the first examinations," Solda said, stating that a guard was severely injured in the explosion.
"The investigations on the explosion are ongoing," he said.
When the prisoners were to be sent to another building before the incident, the reports of the request to meet with the guard were examined, Solda said, adding that the investigators were investigating whether the explosion was part of an escape attempt.
Police officer Jose Carumba told local media that the guard had fired at the prisoners after hearing a gunshot, so a nearby grenade exploded.
Curumba noted that authorities were investigating how the prisoners who shot the guard had put the gun in prison.
Explosions in Thailand
Three people were killed in explosions in four cities in southern Thailand.
Officials say three people were killed in explosions in Trang, Hua Hin, Surat Thani and Phuket, and 35 people, including tourists, were injured.
Police Spokesman Piyapan Phingmuang said at a press conference that the bombings were not linked to terrorism.
"Thailand has no regional or religious issues with anyone."
"We think this is an internal sabotage act," he said.
Cunta leader Prayut Ã‡an-oÃ§a told reporters that he did not want to comment on who was behind the explosions.
"We must focus on ensuring peace and trust," he said.
Last year, on 17 August, 20 people were killed and 120 injured in a bomb attack near the Erawan Temple in Rajprasong, the capital city of Bangkok.
"Sleeping Brutal" will be executed with a poisoned needle
Lonnie David Franklin, 63, was sentenced to death, nicknamed "Griming Sleeper," who was arrested for at least 10 murders in the United States over the years.
Franklin, a former cleaning worker, was targeting prostitutes and drug addicts in their murders.
"I have never seen anyone who committed such a monstrous and so many cruel crimes like you," said Judge Kathleen Kennedy, who tried Franklin.
Franklin is said to be one of the bloodiest killers in California history.
Franklin, who was convicted of deliberately murdering 10 people and attempted murder of one person, was to be executed with a poisoned needle.
Prevention against FETÃ– in Macedonia
Macedonian State Minister Furkan Caco said they have taken steps to legally uncover FETÃ–'s extensions in their countries and to launch the necessary investigations.
"All this is publicly known," Minister Caco reminded that the organisation also has activities in the media and business world in Macedonia.
The Turks here no longer give their children to FETÃ– schools.
We are calling on our people to prevent them from sending their children here.
"This structure, which has benefited from the hospitality and discretion of the people before, is well known by the public," he said.
The sky will be the scene of meteor showers
TUBITAK National Observatory Researcher and Istanbul University Astronomy and Astronomy and Astronomy and Assoc. Dr. Hasan Esenoglu told AA reporter that Perseid will reach the highest level on Friday (August 12th) on Saturday (August 13th).
EsenoÄŸlu stated that thousands of pieces were formed by tearing from the comet "Swift - tuttle" with the influence of the sun and attraction and that the Perseid meteor shower was formed, and he said that this situation would turn into a natural visual feast.
EsenoÄŸlu stated that Perseid asteroid was first discovered in 1862 and that it has been reappeared in the world since the 1990s.
EsenoÄŸlu stated that Perseid meteor shower can be watched in July and August. "We need to watch such a visual feast from space and take care of it."
After all, it's a natural visual feast.
"It will help us to get to know the universe better," he said.
They will shine red, white light when it is cold
EsenoÄŸlu pointed out that some of the fragments that were broken during the meteor shower will fall to the earth the size of lentils, and continued as follows:
Perseid temperatures can be up to 2,000 centigrades.
Due to the warming and friction in the atmosphere, the Perseids are cold in the natural environment, while they are red and white when they are hot.
The International Asteroid Organization's website may contribute to science by writing how many asteroids are seen.
This data is collected from all over the world, so it has information.
Can be watched all night
Reminding that the rain of meteorites travels at about 60 kilometers per second, EsenoÄŸlu stated that this visual feast in the sky can be watched all night long all night from places that receive little light in the northeast direction.
EsenoÄŸlu stated that more than 100 meteor showers occur a year, and after the Perseid meteor shower, Geminid meteor shower was a nature event worth watching on December 4-17.
Less educated, former footballer Erdogan
What impaired this balance was the winning alliance of Fetullah GÃ¼len, a largely religious entrepreneur, and Fetullah GÃ¼len, a largely religious entrepreneur led by former low-trained former footballer Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who established more than a thousand schools, universities and educational institutes from Texas to Tashkent.
The above is the translation of a sentence in an article released last week in Foreign Policy.
Erdogan, who graduated from university, is less educated and former footballer; he graduated from elementary school, is described as a broad entrepreneur, and these and similar articles are frequently included in the Western press, where GÃ¼len disciples are clearly praised.
After that, on the other hand, they are trying to explain in his articles "Why America and/or anti-Westernism is rising in Turkey?"
It is possible to think that analysts who view the opposition of the West in Turkey as a nevvy situation during Erdogan's period are unaware of Turkey's history.
In fact, according to statistics, the first ten years of the Erdogan era can be read as a period when the anti-Westernism in Turkey decreases or remains on average.
During these ten years, both the European Union and the United States had good relations in sync.
Erdogan's criticism of Israel with 'one-minute', the EU's failure to put forward a clear policy after the outbreak of the civil war as a result of the massacres of Assad regime in Syria, and leaving Turkey alone in the refugee crisis, some figures such as the President of the European Parliament Schulz won with the "Erdogan's interlocutor," the opening of a provocative contest against Erdogan in Britain, and the President of London at the time, the President of London, the present Minister of Foreign Affairs, won with a poem that you can't imagine within the Minister of Foreign Affairs, who entered the country from Syria in Turkey,While PKK bombs and repairs our citizens, the PKK's Syrian arm YPG is elevated by opening offices in Europe, the military serving in Syria wear YPG uniforms, Brett McGurk, special representative in charge of the fight against ISIS, the special visits of the PKK's special representative in charge of the fight against ISIS, the opposition groups that do not pose a threat to Turkey, the opposition groups such as YPG, are insisted that the soldiers of the United States serving in Syria wear YPG, and that all the intelligence and logistics support of the United States are shifted to the YPG, while Turkey's ISISthe desperation of his struggle with him, and even the US support and Baghdad management pressure, as in Mosul, reduce our unit number and many other reasons can be counted.
Let's say that while we lost 247 people as a result of the bloody coup, we forgot that our so-called ally EU countries and the United States did not receive any support for our democracy until the failure of the coup proved, and that they expected "peace and stability in Turkey" to be built in Kerry's first remarks, and that they would not emphasize democracy and the elected government.
So, how will it be forgotten that many leaders from the world, including Turkey, participated in a protest march for the murder of 11 Charlie Hebdo employees in Paris, but 247 people resisted tanks for democracy, but it was a month since it was a month after the coup attempt, which was 'allied' to Turkey, that no president from any Western country that was 'allied'?
What do we say about sending low-level representatives of presidents or senior representatives who come in a year for the refugee issue?
How do we go to visit all EU and US ambassadors and make a solidarity visit to the Turkish Grand National Assembly, which was bombed, as the glass of Hurriyet has been broken?
If it is remembered that the coup d'Ã©tat in Egypt is reminded that the EU shook hands with the coup leader Sisi by sending a high-level representative in the first two weeks, Kerry's post-coup visit, "democracy is being rebuilt", is it unusual that Western countries, who have refused to support Turkey in the resistance of democracy, are not sincere in Turkey at every opportunity that they are concerned about democracy in Turkey?
However, even the fact that GÃ¼len, whom 95% of the population considers to be responsible for the coup, is allowed to live freely in the United States, is now enough to infuriate the Turkish people.
If the background I mentioned above is added to this, I think it is clear that the rising anti-Western West/American is not only an explanationable situation with Erdogan.
Moreover, Erdogan has not even said that he still thought the U.S. influence was in the coup...
So the chest was never a speculation
Can Gezini intellectuals play the same line after the night of July 15th, who despise their own people, who say, "The crates is a differentiation," and insulted voters who do not think like him as "the ignorant who scratch his wife", can they play from the same line after the night of July 15th?
After seeing how these people take care of the state and democracy, did they look for answers to the question, "Where were we wrong?"
But there are so many questions that need to be answered?
To be a traitor The officers who served at various levels until yesterday and were given the right to use the weapons of the state, suddenly agreed to enter the status of "Truth" and sought asylum from foreign states.
We need to see what kind of mental distortion we live in and obsessions towards people lead people to behaviors that are described as perversion.
As for the irminded brains coup attempt...
For those involved in this action, was there a view of Turkey's cities beyond comparing them to the cities of Syria?
Why would an officer bomb his own country's parliament?
We should not have been mistaken as waiting for reasonable behavior from brains watered by FETÃ–'s curses.
Others, but let's know that FETÃ– isn't the only one responsible for everything.
The cadres, which offer politics as a profession of fighting, hatred and hatred, have also made the necessary contributions to the tragedies experienced.
They did not serve as "Light," but they made the masses believe that all kinds of irregular behavior and even vulgarity are natural.
We've even seen how they open fire on these people when they've been given a gun to those who hate their own people.
The way of democracy, the path we know
I am saying something very simple: On the evening of July 15th, the people in Turkey gave 250 martyrs to the FETÃ– sufeiers, the unlawfuls, the sergerdes, and established more than saving democracy.
But behind July 15, there are three periods: 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and later.
There are three changes in these three periods: economic, social, political.
The social change was prepared by two major facts: metropole migration from the countryside and the transport of these nomads to the center after being kept around the cities for a very long time.
On Wednesday, I stated that this move was via the subway.
I also emphasized that it is the most important element of social change, whether it's a subway.
The second major change in the same direction are bridges and roads.
The contribution of the road and bridge to modernization is easier to understand.
The road comes, the economic and social structure changes.
In ours, it has changed its political structure as much as it does.
I've identified this historic in Istanbul with bridges over the Bosphorus since then.
Demirel built the Bosphorus Bridge.
This was the peak of the post-1950 peasant movement in the 1960s.
Ã–zal continued to move in the same direction with the second bridge, which we now changed to 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even the road routes of these indicate the relationship between the environment and the center.
It's a sign of what kind of social change course you're being followed.
Demirel and Ã–zal's goal was to dissolve large masses in the center.
It was to adopt the center's ideology to them.
The AK Party did not make the third bridge for many years.
Because migration was going on at full speed.
The people who came were placed in satellite cities.
A slightly closed system was created in those areas.
The local governments of the AK Party gave people a lot of money, business, social status, and they vote for the AK Party.
Thus, it was not asked that the masses melted in the center, but to gain their political consciousness in the environment and then come to the center as 'self'.
This was related to the ongoing headscarf discussions (1992-2002) before the AK Party.
These discussions made the masses accept the necessity of conservative, well-produce and provincial people to stay side by side, not the integration of the center.
The AK Party acted in the method I stated after 2002, politicalizes the masses, incorporates and matures.
After that, now pay attention, 3. With the construction of the bridge, the democratic struggle on July 15 is coercion.
So history and sociology are overlapping.
Let me add one more dimension to this: The AK Party's move, which I mentioned, is not limited to the bridges of Istanbul.
One more interesting thing is: The AK Party is now integrating the surrounding cities with central cities.
This is provided through two bridges.
One, Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, Ã‡anakkale 1915 bridge.
Add ways to that.
Turkey will now reach Izmir from Thrace to Izmir from another route.
Do you know what this means, Izmir will be a different city from now on.
Let's say that the AK Party will now take Izmir from the 'outside', which it cannot get from the inside.
Now Bursa, Ã‡anakkale, now Thrace cities will turn into other human and social geographies.
That's it! That's it!
The martyrs of July 15 are the stars of this great adventure.
Van Persie and cheerful training in FenerbahÃ§e
FenerbahÃ§e continued to prepare for the Grasshoppers match in the morning hours.
The training, which started at 10.00 under the direction of coach Vitor Pereira at Can Bartu Facilities, lasted a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes.
After 30 minutes of core training in the hall, the players who came to the field carried out 5-2 balls grab and pass with running and warm-up movements.
The training was completed with double goal matches in the narrow area.
FenerbahÃ§e will continue its preparations with the training he will do in the evening hours.
He's the one who complained about St. Lightning to GÃ¼len...
There are new developments regarding the Operation Shike against FenerbahÃ§e.
"A name from the world of sports has trained Fethullah GÃ¼len's words about Aziz YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m himself," said journalist HÃ¼seyin GÃ¼lerce, who participated in a programme published on CNN Turk and announced that this operation was carried out by FETÃ–.
"One day, the Lightning said to this person on the plane, "What are you doing with Fethullah GÃ¼len?"
When this person conveyed these words to GÃ¼len, Fethullah GÃ¼len also attached to Aziz YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m.
Why did he put it on St. Lightning?
The president of the club, which is the most supporter of Turkey, thinks that if it is in this mindset, it can harm itself.
"The Sike case was to liquidate Aziz YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m."
Following these statements, a statement came from Faik IÅŸÄ±k, one of the most important lawyers of the Åžike Trial.
IÅŸÄ±k appeared on the Contradiction Vision program in HabertÃ¼rk and announced the person who complained about Aziz YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m to FETÃ– leader Fethullah GÃ¼len.
Here are the words of Faik IÅŸÄ±k:
Aziz YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m is saying something to Ihsan Kalkavan about Fethullah GÃ¼len.
On the private plane from Azerbaijan.
Aziz is a humorous man, and he says in intruder sentences when he criticizes someone.
Maybe those intruders breeze a little.
Some may react to those sentences.
These sentences are brought to something.
Towels, patronages, so many businessmen go there as if they were going to Hajj, Umrah, is not a job to accept with such tolerance.
What they call work, they criticize it very badly.
Of course, that's not the only problem.
By the way, there's a football team trial.
The direct connections of some footballers and managers from Galatasaray Club and Hakan ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r...
Muharrem Usta: The subject of the match is different
Trabzonspor President Muharrem Usta reached out to FenerbahÃ§e for friendship.
"We are on the side of this country with 79 million," he said, stating that Turkey's issue is a matter of all clubs.
We need to take a solid stand.
If FenerbahÃ§e has a problem with FETÃ–, if it has been unfair, I will stand behind FenerbahÃ§e.
"However, the match-fixing issue between Trabzonspor and FenerbahÃ§e is different," he said.
Sacrifice prices announced
Karabulut said: "As a unit, we set the price of live sacrificial calf at 18 liras."
"We also determined the price of the plant as 17 liras live kilograms and the live kilogram price of the cow, which we call second class, as 15 liras."
Karabulut, who pointed out that the animals that would not be sacrificed last year were also on sale, explained what the citizens should pay attention to when taking the sacrifice:
Especially in animals, attention should be paid to the earring.
It is also very important that the animal is healthy.
For this, they can check the vaccinations of the animal's passport when they are sacrificing our citizens.
In appearance, the victim must be alive and alive, and he must have thrown away his feathers.
You shouldn't have sloly or snot-no symptoms on your face.
In the past few years, we've seen non-victims also sell and sold.
An animal with a sacrifice has to be two years old.
And we can see that by looking at the animal's teeth.
An animal over the age of 2 has teeth that we call 'cover'.
But the animals that are underage have no teeth.
The animal may be seen as a visual, but the valve teeth may not have come out.
The cover teeth are also noticeable immediately because they are already large compared to others.
Rize Airport to be built at sea
The second airport to be built with sea filling in Turkey will be Rize Airport.
Rize Airport will be built on a sea fill 26 to 32 meters from the coast, 26 to 32 meters from the coast, between the village of YeÅŸilkÃ¶y and the Maiden's Tower.

Here are the Galatasaray footballers in GÃ¼len's chat
It was revealed that Galatasaray and national footballers, who had been marked by Turkish football for a period, appeared in the conversation of Fetullah GÃ¼len, the leader of FETÃ–, in 1996.

Very striking statements about FETÃ– from Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, the official of the Amsterdam&Partners law firm, who legally investigated the international illegal activities of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization (FETÃ–), wrote an article in the US magazine Forbes and shared information on how FETÃ– was organized.
Stating that Fetullah GÃ¼len, the leader of FETÃ–, led the organization from his Pennsylvania mansion, Amsterdam said, "When it is closely looked at how he operates about 150 contract (charter) schools in the United States, it will be clear that the organization has a secretly highly developed organizational ability under the ground."
Amsterdam said seven months ago, Turkey was tasked with investigating GÃ¼len-related companies and schools, stressing that what they have found so far is "shocking."
In his article Amsterdam, he wrote the following opinions:
According to the information the dynasty of the GÃ¼len organization has a strict hierarchy, which is conveyed by instructions.
These instructions are usually conveyed at face-to-face meetings with GÃ¼len in Poconos.
There are seven-person management group (consult group) on the hill.
This group is transmitting the instructions to the advisory committee.
The instructions go to regional imams, country imams, regional imams, provincial imams, regional imams, neighborhood imams, imams of student houses (light houses) and students respectively.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels based on their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam reported that the Organization opened 55,000 businesses worldwide and that it has the largest contracted school network in the United States, and that millions of dollars are given to these schools every year from the taxes paid by American taxpayers.
Amsterdam wrote that most of these funds were redirected by members of the organization and transferred to "chosen" subcontractors.
Amsterdam explained this process with the following examples:
The schools of Magnolia, California, were apprehended for $700,000 for a yearly service contract to the company, which was linked to GÃ¼len and shared the same office.
Another example, Amsterdam cited the Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma.
Amsterdam noted that this school also paid the property owner an extra $3.1 million, as well as that the administrations of the school and the property owner company were identified as the same persons associated with GÃ¼len.
Noting that there are similar situations in the 46 branches Harmony schools that hold the biggest place in the GÃ¼len network, Amsterdam said that smaller companies connected to FETÃ– have been paid with items such as software licenses and curriculum purchases.
"These examples show that about $28 million of American taxpayers have been misused," Amsterdam underlined that it has enriched each other within FETÃ–.
"This is the part of what we've found so far," he said.
Pointing out that so far, Amsterdam has not been done to prevent such incidents, reminding that the situation has worsened over the course of time, and the Texas Education Department has begun to investigate irregularities.

The coup provocates strengthened their positions over the years.

Amsterdam finished his article as follows:
The political producers in the United States have questions about the events of July 15th and 16, and that's expected.
However, while addressing the two allies at a diplomatic level, individually, state authorities must awaken the rapid violation of the US law in GÃ¼len's operations.

Pay attention to this habit of children
Faculty of Dentistry Assoc. Dr. Bilgin Giray said that children are relieved with this reflex by making suction to absorb as a necessity because they cannot chew at first.
Associate Professor, who lists the reasons for the appearance of finger sucking habits in children. Dr. "Finger sucking is an event that occurs from birth to 3-4 years old."
Most babies suck their thumbs.
The child, who sucks his finger for satisfaction with the need for sucking in his infancy, sucks his finger to satisfy the expectation of the mother breast after 1-1,5 years of age and relax.
"He can be bored and distracted, when he gets sleepy, when he's nervous and breaks up with the mother, he can do finger sucking behavior."
Emphasizing the fact that the inadequacy in the mother-child relationship and the lack of confidence in the child is the basis of the behavior of finger absorption in older ages. Dr. Bilgin Giray explained the effects of this behavior on dental health with the following words:
Finger sucking behavior has a negative effect on the shaping of the child's tooth structure.
As a result of the pressures that occur during suction, the upper teeth are pushed forward, while the teeth at the bottom are pushed back.
This leads to the positioning of the lower jaw behind, disrupting the balance of the palate and the tooth structure.
The physiological reflection of this is that the speech impairment and its closure look aesthetically bad.
Prof. Dr. Assoc. Prof. Dr., who pointed out that if there is no early solution, a much more complex treatment process can occur during the 6-7 years of age when permanent teeth start to come out. Dr. "We can protect our children from closing and joint problems before the development of the jaw is completed."
"For this reason, children need to be kept under control of the oral structure such as eye and hearing controls today," he concluded.
New pale in the treatment of close vision: Trifocal Lenses
Patients do not want to use glasses naturally after cataract treatment.
Many focused lenses have already been used for many years to solve this problem in our patients.
The trifocal lenses that have been started to be used recently have taken a step further than the success of the treatment in this area.
The difference between trifocal lenses from other lenses is not only far or close distance, but also at distances defined as intermediate distance.
Treatment of distant, close or intermediate distance visual disorders
Interim distance in visual disorders represents a point that we use very often in our daily lives.
For example, the dashboard of cars is the intermediary distances that we define as the portable computers we hold on our lap, or the distance we define as 60-70 cm arm length.
Thanks to the correction of the distances of trifocal lenses, our patients do not need to use glasses in any way, whether close or far.
Another advantage provided by trifocal lenses is that it reduces night complaints.
Eye Diseases Specialist Assoc. Dr. Volkan HÃ¼rmeriÃ§ "Prisocal lens therapy for every distance vision treatment is no different from normal cataract treatment."
Our patients with trifocal treatments will easily get eye health with a procedure of 7 to 10 minutes.

The varicose vein is not used for cardiovascular surgery!
Varicose is a disease that has increased in the frequency in recent years.
The varist, where genetic proximity is the primary factor, causes long working hours, jobs that are required to stand for a long time and long-term resilience increases complaints.
Are veins used in cardiac surgeries?
I have a heir, and there are questions such as what to do if I have a heart attack in the future?
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of vein system in the leg:
1.The leg has a deep artillery system, which leads to the lungs and collects the main dirty blood of the leg.
They take the name of deep femoral vein and superficial femoral vein.
Problems in these veins are more rare, the veins cannot be closed in their diseases, and drug treatments are applied to keep these vessels open.
There is a superficial vein system in the leg, which leads the dirty blood to the lungs and combines with the deep vein system in the groin.
This system consists of two large and two small safen veins.
In all four of these vessels, insufficiency and heir can develop.
Artilleras that can be used in heart surgeries are superficial veins called large safen veins.
The absence of these vessels has no harm to the body, and therefore they can be used in heart surgeries.
However, in order for these vessels to be used in heart surgery, the vessels must be healthy.
Because the heart is a very important organ.
The process of taking varicose veins with surgery or laser release and burning the deep veins also reduces the workload of the deep veins and makes the leg healthier.
A misconception among the people is that even if it is varicose veins can be used as a substitute.
The heirloom vein is never used in heart surgeries!
There are other vessels that can be used in heart surgery.
The backup vascular systems that can be used in heart surgery are located below the chest cage, around the stomach and in the arm.
Therefore, it is undue to keep the varicose vein for use for the heart and to worry about it.

Meaningful message from Uzbek before the Super Cup

This is not the first or the last game of our two distinguished clubs in the competition that left a century behind.
But it's a very vital encounter as a timing.

The coup attempt of the Fetullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Building (FETÃ–/PDY), which refers to our democracy, was overcome by the unity and unity of all segments of society.
That night, as a nation, we paid heavy prices.
We've given martyrs.
We have a lot of gas.
This bitter price once again reminded us of the virtue of democracy, the necessity and importance of peace in this land, not fighting.
That night, the representatives of the Turkish sport also opposed the coup as one voice, one heart; together he took part in democracy.
In these critical days, we need the unifying feature of sports more than ever.
The precious President of our esteemed opponent, SÃ¼leyman Seba, 2. I wish this match, which coincided with the anniversary of his death and the new football season named after Turgay Åžeren, the legendary captain of our club, to be the starting match of the love and peace environment in Turkish sports.
I hope that the winner will be our country and Turkish sport at the end of the match, which will be played in front of the stands where Galatasaray and BeÅŸiktaÅŸ fans will share in half.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home while Britain turns off gold
As the British Trio retained the title from London in 2012, Scottish's Callum Skinner won last night in the men's race race on the Rio race.
The Glasgowan, 23-year-old racer, took the lead role adopted by Scottish Sir Chris Hoy, and made this legend proud as he returned home victoriously, in his appreciationd New Zealand garment.
At the event four years ago, where Hoy received five of the six Olympic gold, Britain was a shocking victory.
And despite Hoy's retirement, they finished sixth in the World Championships in London in March, reiterating.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of expert starter Jamie Staff.
They did that just as Hindes showed up.
Hoy's retirement also created a gap in which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
He had already seen Scot's potential and the British coaches did not give up Skinner.
Hindes, who won the title with Hoy four years ago, broke the Olympic record in the ranking round, but New Zealand re-determed the record in the first round.
And the British trio was duel for gold.
Hindes was a little behind him in his tour, but Kenny brought the team up ahead, and Skinner endured it.
This was a change of strategy for a greater tool that would slow Hindes himself down, and a large part of the transformation that allowed Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy watched them as BBC expert commentator, and when they went on the podium, he caught the eye of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes.
Skinner, 23, Glasgow, said: "This is an honorable comparison."
I'm just here to do my best and announce my name.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
That was really incredible.
There's no better way to win this.
Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a bad start after a victory with Kenny and Hoy in 2012 in London.
He later reacted to this comment, and there was no way to make a request from Britain's competitors.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hindes said: "It was as if we were in London with all the British flags on the stand."
We're just a team that was set up three months ago.
We've lost a lot of world racing, so it's really amazing to win back in the Olympics.
This is just an event, a medal for a nation that won seven out of 10 races in both Beijing and London.
If this is the measure of progress in the last five months, there are five more successful days waiting for us on the racetrack.
Kenny's attitude shows that Hoy's dream of reiterating three gold winning records at a single Olympic is not impossible.
This will mean Kenny's six gold medals and a silver medal, which is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy and is born on March 23 (also a birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister, a British sport history).
That's the same level as Hoy.
Kenny will now go to the sprint race; the race will start today and it will take three days.
Bolton, 28, said: "For now, I only enjoy it.
Team events are always the best activities.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, when you win alone, you feel lonely.
Hindes said: "If he wins two more gold medals, he must be given the title of knight."
Although this is just the event of today's medal, there's a lot of good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull finished first in the four-kilometer team race.
They completed the track in a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set by the winner of the gold medal in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be determined in today's second part, and Wiggins will definitely attract all attention.
Yesterday, before the ranking round, the authorities had a disagreement with the officials when they called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record for 4:13260 at the women's event, which will continue and will be completed tomorrow.
The Great Britain Team relies on the strong cycling team to deal with the reins during the mid-Olympic Games and win many medals.
After great superiority in Beijing and London, expectations in Rio were greatly reduced.
The background led to many bad developments, including manager Shane Sutton's resignation in April due to sexism and bullying charges, including the retirement of important names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, the first night after the races on the track shows that Great Britain's epic reputation for ending in perfect time can be proven again this time.
With the cancellation of the energy contract, the future of the Portland court is doubtful
The future of the Portland aluminum canabe in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers fell into uncertainty after one of the plant owners announced the termination of a supply contract, which would lead to the cancellation of all supply contracts of the energy company that provides the plant.
This move emerged earlier this year after the Victorian government's decision not to exceed subsidies to continue the facility's operation.
The 20-year fixed subsidy expires in November.
Alcoa's Portland facility could be at risk by 2000.
Any closing process can cause up to 2000 jobs to be directly or indirectly risked.
And since the cannabis consumes about 10 percent of Victoria's electricity, additional chain effects may occur.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed the quarry, which led to the shutdown of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland settlement is losing money and is at risk of closing.
These developments have emerged after several years of speculation for the future of the facility, based on the strengthening of the Australian dollar and the recent consumption fee of the facility.
AGL, which provides energy from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley to the large aluminum isabe quarry, said he expects the other three owners to take action to terminate their contracts.
The vast majority of the facility belong to Alcoa and Alumina's joint venture, and China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp companies have smaller shares.
"AL expects the Portland plant to continue to work, which means that the demand for physical electricity of the cannabis will continue," he said.
AGL stated that the agreements are "risk balancing agreements" that must enter into force as of November 2016.
The contracts will be completed in 2017, as it is a 12-month period of termination.
"Therefore, AGL will continue to wait for the contracts to contribute to the fiscal year 2017," the energy company said.
The effects that AGL may be exposed to potential earnings in the 2018 Fiscal Year and later are limited to adopting a strong future contract stance for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said that the value of its contracts in their accounts has already dropped by $187m due to the "fessing".
Alcoa stated that the decision on the termination of the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to supply electricity to the operation or the cannabis."
The US company signed a 20-year contract in 2010, which was supposed to enter into force in November this year, but did not yet explain why it did not withdraw from this contract.
Analyzers are on the lookout for both the Portland canabe in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle, in case of economic difficulties in the sector.
Responding to analysts earlier this week, Stephen Mikkels, who was in charge of operations at AGL, said Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year and Tomago uses 900 megawatts of energy.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, [electric] will cause the demand in the [electric] market to drop significantly.
And as a manufacturer, this will not be a good development for us."
Not only is not only the star of Kardashian TV, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue
The fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner group, Kendall Jenner (20), is on the cover of the U.S. Vogue's unpredictable September issue.
Kendall, a Estee Lauder brand ambassador and appeared in Milan, Paris and New York fashion weeks, announced this news on his Instagram account on Thursday.
Kendall wrote, "I cried when I looked in this cover in a room full of people I loved."
Following the announcement of the cover, a strange (or only Keeping Up with the Kardashians program), where the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (the problemmaker Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite show world, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest), were released in the video; the family who forgot the cover of their sisters later prepared a classic ending: they were actually preparing a surprise party.
Although this is the clichÃ© storyline of every "birthday" episode of almost all children's television programs (Seacrest says "Do you think we've forgotten you?" Kris, in some way, should have included other girls in this introduction in 8 am.
With this development in the September issue of Vogue, we are definitely entering a new Kardashian period.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have passed him on the Vogue cover (the door was sharing with his wife Kanye West in April 2014) but the September cover of the magazine was a success in itself.
The September issue of Vogue was the best-selling number of the year.
With its thickness, which resembles a coffee table book rather than a fashion magazine, this number attracted the attention of many advertisers (Fashionista found that 615 of the 832 pages of last year's 832 pages of skin contained advertising content).
The announcement of the cover star is also closely monitored; the magazine's pictures have been leaked in advance for the past two years.
Among the women previously on the cover are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has included "famous celebrities" rather than "famous models."
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar-winning Dior envoy, was featured on the cover in 2013, and the next year, this honor was given to Lady Gaga.
However, even if Mrs. Jenner, who was described by the magazine as the "finger model" of the "border model," was included in the previous category, it can be said that the environment is quite good.
These celebrities are not the relatives of celebrities or reality show stars or young people of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (then Jenner is all of them).
These are all women who are legitimate, who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who was on the cover of last year, spent one of the best times of her career with Lemonade's release.
Of course, not everyone's happy with Jenner's success.
Due to the reality show history, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be disturbing.
In June, the original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "the shepherds of time."
When the news came out that Jenner was going to be on the cover of Vogue, that thought came back to light.
But it seems uncalled for to focus on dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Issue of Vogue.
He's literally a supermodel.
He's going to Marc Jacobs' fashion shows.
Estee Lauder's getting you a foundation.
He sells his own pictures in the relevant payment wall applications with his sisters.
She's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, maybe he's just on television to see his brother Kourtney and his kids on television.
Social legal support centres reject 160,000 people every year
While the sector is preparing for the effect that will create more financing cuts in already challenged operations, more than 160,000 people from the most vulnerable part of the nation are being turned away from social legal support centres.
In Queensland, three out of five people (mostly elderly, migrants, victims of violence, and those without resources to cope with unfair evacuation decisions) are turned down while seeking free legal advice and representation.
Social legal support services, which have exhausted their opportunities, are preparing for further interruption.
As of June next year, these legal support centres are planned to be deprived of more than 30 per cent of federal funding.
James Farrel, Director of Queensland of Social Legal Support Centres, reported that thousands of people are turned down every year in the latest Census Report of the National Union of Social Legal Support Centers.
Mr. Farrel said the situation would be much worse if the federal government decision was not revoked.
"Queensland's social legal support centres are chronically inadequate financially, which means that thousands of people are unable to access the vital services they need," he said.
People who are in violent relationships, who struggle with power and irritating forces, families in the process of leaving and unfairly dismissed workers... All of this is faced with legal problems, and according to this report, they cannot reach the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut financing by 30 per cent, which means that thousands of unprotected Queensland residents are forced to cope with more complex legal issues without assistance.
We urge the Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandis to retract these funding cuts immediately so that people can get the support they need when faced with a legal problem.
Last year, the government fulfilled its commitment to increase legal support financing to a national average.
We should now look at the social legal support centres and the investments of the Palaszczuk government to work with the communities they serve.
Donald Trump's campaign team was sued after alleging the staff pulled a gun
New York: Donald Trump's campaign team was sued for alleged involvement in a staff officer in February when the director of the North Carolina operations was told that he had taken any action.
The case was announced Wednesday in a case filed by former software instructor Vincent Bordini on the state campaign team.
Bordini stated that he expects to be dealt with the situation from the inside for months, but later he realized that "it will not happen."
As Bordini's complaint, Director Earl Philip "lifted a gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and put the barrel towards Vincent's kneecap."
According to the complaint, Bordini learned that after complaining to the local and regional campaign team leaders, at least four others had the same experience as Phillip.
"There is no need to fire weapons to damage," Bordini said in his complaint.
The case was opened two days after the Republican presidential candidate was provoked two days after he caused anger at the crowd in North Carolina, saying that "Second Constitutional change people" (as it is understood to be armed owners and supporters of arms) if his opponent Hillary Clinton was elected and elected his own judges.
Trump's campaign team said the media considered these statements outside the context and that he did not support the violence.
Bordini, complaining, asks for compensation from the campaign team due to detention negligence and Phillip for assault, battery and moral damage.
Trump's spokesman, Hope Hicks, did not return quickly to the message asking him to comment.
Their efforts to reach Phillip were inconclusive.
The WCCB, a local news affiliate in Charlotte, has recently announced that Phillip has recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not returned quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is conducting a conflicting campaign.

Inspired by Bodrum, they made 'example village' in Sivas
"Sexak village" was built in cooperation with CankÃ¶y, District Governorate and philanthropist businessman of GÃ¶lova District of SIVAS.
In the village where the roads were paved and paved with parquet stones on the sidewalks, all the houses were painted in blue and white colors by taking the sample of Bodrum district of MuÄŸla.
GÃ¶lova District Governorship has prepared a model village project to improve the appearance and quality of life of villages connected to the district.
In this context, 66-digit CankÃ¶y, 12 kilometers from the district center, was chosen as a model village.
The roads of the village, which were increased infrastructure and superstructure services, were paved and the pavements were covered with parquet stones.
The village houses with different shades were painted with the support of Selahattin Ayan, a businessman who owned Pelit Patisseries.
The whole of the village was painted in white and blue colors.
BODRUM SAMPLE
Giving information about the study, GÃ¶lova District Governor Erkan Isa Erat stated that they have prepared this project to sign a role model for other villages and said: "It was part of our project that the village looked more modern and all the houses were one color."
As we started this project, we searched for a place where we would take samples.
When we went to Bodrum, we noticed the appearance of the houses with white painted and blue windows.
We wanted to take the example of Bodrum because of the cleanliness of white and its positive effect on people.
By doing our work, we painted all the houses in CankÃ¶y in white and blue colors.
This work was carried out in cooperation with the state and philanthropic.
The project cost about 200 thousand pounds.
With the study, our CankÃ¶y in Sivas became like a small Bodrum.
We want to continue this kind of work with the support of our budget and again our businessmen.
CankÃ¶y Mayor Abdullah Macit, 66, said that the village has a brand new look with the support of the District Governor's Office.
Macit said that being a model village also pleased them and the villagers and thanked everyone who contributed.
Drug operation in Kangal

4 people's property was confiscated with GÃ¼len in the FETÃ–/PDY case in Adana
It was decided to confiscate all assets of Fethullah GÃ¼len, Ã–mer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were tried and fugitives at the 2nd High Criminal Court for allegedly profiting the Fethullahist Terrorist Organization/Parallel State Building (FETÃ–/PDY) in ADANA.
In 2012, with a report to Adana Police Directorate, it was claimed that the land belonging to Kanuni University, known for its proximity to the GÃ¼len community by zoning corruption and the forgery of the Metropolitan Municipality, was transformed into a residential area and the municipality of the community to reach 150 million liras by turning into a housing area, although it was not a parliamentary decision.

The 2nd High Criminal Court was indicted for imprisonment between 5 and 5 of them, including Fethullah GÃ¼len and former Adana Metropolitan Municipality Deputy Mayor Zihni AldÄ±rmaz, with a request for imprisonment between 5-35 years.
While all defendants did not plead guilty, all arrests were released under judicial control and a ban abroad in the last hearing of the case.
MAL VARERS
The court issued an arrest warrant against Ã–mer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were on the run with Fethullah GÃ¼len, the number one defendant in the case.
However, the court has decided to carry out illegal proceedings for four fugitives who have not been caught and have not been to trials.
In order to ensure that the case against them is inconclusive, the court decided that Fethullah GÃ¼len, Ã–mer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, who were in the foreign country and therefore were illegal because they could not reach him, would be confiscated in accordance with Article 278/1 of the Criminal Procedures Law (CPC).
With this decision of the court, the immovables, land-marine and air transportation vehicles belonging to the fugitive defendants in Turkey, all kinds of rights and receivables, securities, share of the company with which they are partners, the available persons and bank accounts were frozen.

Audited asset fund re-attach
The Turkish Wealth Fund, which is expected to be among the world's largest funds, has been removed from the law after objections.
It was decided to renegotiate the fund because it lacked control mechanism, but it was discussed again in the commission without any changes.
CHP MP and Plan and Budget Commission Member Utku Ã‡akÄ±rÃ¶zer, who evaluated the AKP's proposed Turkish Wealth Fund law to sozcu.com.tr, said, "We are absolutely against keeping this structure, which will be made up of the unemployment fund collected for the unemployed, excludes from the constitutional control mechanisms of the public."
The Turkish Wealth Fund law proposal, drafted by the government to provide long-term resources for investments and projects, was removed from the bag law Tuesday, with the opposition's opinion that it should be discussed separately.
Today, however, the AKP has brought the proposal back to the Plan and Budget Commission.
EskiÅŸehir Deputy Utku Ã‡akÄ±rÃ¶zer, deputy of the CHP of the Parliamentary Plan and Budget Commission, told sozcu.com.tr about the CHP's concerns and concerns about the Wealth Fund law proposal.
"When the establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission within the draft law, our former Finance Minister Zekeriya Temizel, who was the head of the CHP delegation, expressed our concerns and concerns, proposed that it be removed from the bag law and also discussing it in detail."
The government, which accepted our view, also withdrew the bill.
The bill came back to the commission yesterday in the same way.
"The government seems to insist that it be removed from the House within a week," he said.
"Our biggest concern in this law proposal is ruleless," CakirÃ¶zer said, stating that there should be a consensus on the emergence of the Wealth Fund law law.
"The assets belonging to the public, the obligatory pension cuts to be taken from the employees, the incomes to be made from the unemployment fund for the unemployed, the incomes to be obtained from the privatization are transferred to a structure other than the Parliament and the Court of Auditors and has no responsibility."
Cakirozer stated that Russia, China and the Gulf countries, where such funds were established, had oil revenues and excess trade, and that the fund was funded in this way. "But we have a savings deficit."
That's why the fund will be made up of public resources, the money of the people.
A total of 100 billion in the unemployment fund is planned to transfer 100 billion from the individual pension fund, which has been challenged to employees, and 50 billion from privatisation.
"I mean, this fund, which will be entirely created with the money of the people, must be in public control and should not be spent irresponsibly," he said.
Cakirozer stressed that it is unacceptable to keep a fund out of Parliament's control, where the state's resources are collected and the state's assets are collateralized in its debt, and he explained his concerns and concerns about the proposal of the Wealth Fund law as follows:
The collection, expenditure, and transactions related to the collection, borrowing of such a large public presence on behalf of the public cannot be passed only by the supervision of independent auditing companies.
There must be public supervision and a transparent structure.
The Law proposal does not contain provisions on the supervision and transparency of the Wealth Fund by constitutional institutions.
No restrictions on how much resources will be transferred.
No one will be able to answer to how this fund was used.
The purpose of the fund is to finance large projects.
There's no need to set up an unsupervised fund outside the budget.
Why don't you put it on the budget?
And when that happens, naturally, the question comes to mind, "Why is he running away from the supervision of SAyiÅŸtaÅŸ and the Assembly?"
CakirÃ¶zer stated that they are not against the transfer of the money accumulated in the Wealth Fund to investments, but that they are against the fact that it is done through non-transparent, non-calculating mechanisms. "Can such a fund be discussed?"
But if the government insists on this, then we have to ensure that the valid international standards in other countries where such mutual funds are established are valid in Turkey.
It must be structured in a way that is brought in the audit and responsibility mechanism.
It must be established in a way that will pay for the account of the account of the money used to the citizen, which will not have doubts on it.
CakirÃ¶zer underlined that they are absolutely against the Commission as they came to the Commission for the Wealth Fund. "We are pleased that the AKP is listening to our criticisms especially in Parliament after the July 15 coup attempt."
In this law proposal, we hope that the AKP will listen to our constructive criticisms.
We are against the unmarked use of national assets, transferring, irresponsible to those who use it and there is no public supervision.
"The Desired Wealth Fund can only be useful if these concerns are resolved," he said.
It was learned that the proposal of the law was being carried out to reach a consensus between the AKP and the opposition.
"It is the investments we make indices of our trust in Turkey"
Speaking at a meeting in Istanbul, Ford Automotive Chairman Ali KoÃ§ said, "The 30 billion TL investment we have made in the last 5 years is an indication of our confidence in the future of our country."
Ali KoÃ§, Deputy Chairman of the Board of Directors of KoÃ§ Holding and Chairman of the Board of Directors of Ford Automotive, met at the meeting on "Trusters in Turkey, those who trust in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
"We are not only expressing our faith and trust in our country with our partners, but we fill the bottom of this with our investments and actions."
Our 30 billion TL investment in the last 5 years is an indication of our trust in the future of our country.
It is an ecosystem that promotes a reliable and fair legal system, a democracy in international standards, qualified workforce and R&D, innovation, entrepreneurship and value added value in order to attract more foreign investment in Turkey.
Over the past few years, our government has offered our industrialists the most comprehensive incentives in the history of the Republic.
"I believe that with these incentives and holistic strategies, we will be able to launch a new "Investment Move" that we need."
HÃ¼seyin Gelis, Chairman and CEO of Siemens Industry and Trade Turkey, said, "Nothing is the problem of a single country anymore, but we know this as global players."
We came to Turkey with a long-term look.
If we are united and united, our problems will be solved.
160 years ago, we were able to bring to this land that could not be found in Turkey.
We will continue to be in these areas in Turkey.
"Of course we will build factories, but in this area, our horizons must be clear," he said.
Stating that Turkey is one of the 10 priority countries for them, Shell Turkey Country President Ahmet Erdem said, "Turkey is one of the 10 priority countries for Shell."
We believe in Turkey's potential and future.
We have invested in many areas, especially energy, and we continue to do so.
We would like to thank our President, Prime Minister and Ministers for their support for international investors.
Reassuring works are being carried out for international investors.
"This is in a direction that will increase the competitiveness of our country," he said.
Sandoz/Novartis President of Turkey and Middle East Region Dr. Altan Demirdere said, "Our Global CEO was coming to Turkey on August 10th."
But the trip was postponed.
That's what we opposed.
Because the CEO's arrival was very important.
They made requests such as bulletproof car, protection.
And then when he came here, he saw that everything was normal.
He left the guards and the car and returned to his country happy.
Investment in a country is similar to marriage.
First it's a promise, and if everything goes well, you'll get engaged and you'll get married with a long-term plan.
We are married to Turkey and we have no intention of divorce.
It's come back from the brink of the cliff!
Prime Minister Binali YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m addressed businessmen by teleconference to the consultation meeting on "Trusters in Turkey, Producers in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry in Swiss Hotel.
Stating that the sector that will provide the comparative superiority of Turkey is the industrial sector, Prime Minister YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m said, "We should not miss the transition process to 'Industry 4.0' in the industry sector."
"If we care about achieving the targets of 2023, high added value, we need to think about the industrial revolution together with the IT and technology revolution and we have to achieve this."
"We were talking about another Turkey today, if they were successful, if they were successful," Prime Minister YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m added, adding that Turkey had returned from the brink of a great gap on the night of July 15th. "We were talking about another Turkey today, those who tried to destroy their democracy, who were not afraid to bomb our Veterans' Assembly."
We would talk about a Turkey among the 3rd world countries, which was taken over by the coup, the national will was eliminated and the world has fallen from the developing countries league.
"Thank God, we have eliminated this trouble with the determination of our nation, the Chief of General, our President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan and the determination of our government."
"We will quickly get out of the influence of this incident and move forward."
It's never, ever true that we live with a constant blow.
We have very ambitious goals ahead of us.
This coup attempt did not shake the Turkish economy.
Those who were waiting for chaos and crisis were wrong once again.
Today, both our democracy and our economy are standing up to me.
Our banking sector and finance sector continue to work in a healthy way.
In 2015, the foreign trade deficit fell by 25 per cent.
The current account deficit rate to national income was 5.8 per cent in 2014, which dropped to 4.5 in 2015.
At the end of this year, we aim to reduce it to 4.
We will never change our firm stance on public finances.
Turkey's 2016 budget also exceeded the national income of 130 countries.
We have reduced the rate of budget deficit to national income, which is above 11%, to 1.3 percent in 2015, and we strive to maintain these rates.
We are better off in public debt than the EU, from many countries around the world.
Our banking finance sector continues to work on a solid ground.
"Despite July 15th, our Central Bank did not need to give foreign currency to the market, and there is no decrease in our reserves, we have more than $121 billion gross reserves," he said.
Prime Minister YÄ±ldÄ±rÄ±m stated that they will provide all kinds of convenience for the development of the economy, the increase of production and the formation of new employment areas. "We are also making comprehensive arrangements to save your burdens for the past."
We have implemented many regulations, we continue to implement and continue to re-establish tax debts from stock amnesty to over-the-country and return to installment.
"Keep on producing for the country, keep trusting your country, and your government will continue to lift the obstacles in front of you one by one," he said.
Hakan ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r's father was hospitalized for high sugar
Hakan ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r's father, Sermet ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r, who was detained as part of the operation against the FETÃ–/PDY terrorist organization in Sakarya, was taken to the hospital as a result of the increase of his sugar during the interrogation.
During the operation initiated by Sakarya Chief Public Prosecutor's Office on FETÃ–/PDY terrorist organization after the July 15 coup attempt, the arrest of former national footballer Hakan ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r and his father Sermet ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r was arrested last night.
Hakan ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r, who was detained in AdapazarÄ± at the end of Friday prayer, was taken to the hospital when his interrogation continued.
Sermet ÅžÃ¼kÃ¼r, who was hospitalized as a result of the rise of sugar, continues his treatment at Sakarya Training and Research Hospital.
Turkey does not break away from the West, does not give up on the European Union
Mehmet ÅžimÅŸek: Turkey does not break away from the West, does not give up the European Union
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet ÅžimÅŸek, Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Ã–zlÃ¼, Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci attended the meeting on "Trusters in Turkey, those who trust in Turkey" organized by the Istanbul Chamber of Industry (ISO).
"I think there are many good results from the developments that took place on the night of July 15th and after," said Minister of Science Industry and Technology Faruk Ã–zlÃ¼.
The most important of these is undoubtedly the spirit of unity and unity that the whole of Turkey feels deeply at the moment.
The July 15 process showed how solid dynamics the Turkish economy has, and how deeply the society has demographics of democracy.
"It is clear that the next process will progress better and faster for a society that has achieved this level in economics and democracy and democracy."
"I NEED TO BE LET'S DANGEROUS"
Minister of Economy Nihat Zeybekci, who said that they had difficulty explaining the July 15 coup attempt from Faruk Ã–zlÃ¼ to the world, stated that they have declared mobilization on this issue as a government.
Zeybekci also addressed the interest reductions initiated by banks recently, "If 63.4% of the profits of my real sector goes to interest, we should give up our whole business and concentrate on this."
That's why the President is going back and telling you this.
Turkey needs to get rid of this problem with its real sector, banking system, government, politics, and the unity of politics after the July 15 civil Turkish democracy revolution.
We welcome recent developments in this regard.
"I hope that we will realize its sustainability and continuity by supporting this competition, which starts downwards as nine and eights in the next period, which is started by banks with the encouragement of our President."
"WE WILL GIVE THE LEGAL PASSPORTS TO THE EMR OF OUR EXPORT"
"The world wins in the next period, we will be scoops," Nihat Zeybekci said. "We will not leave a country that has not gone in the world under the leadership of our President, our Prime Minister, we will not leave the unspoiled door."
We will not leave anyone we don't contact with increasing our trade.
"We will never, ever ignore this; we will not be one of the birds at hand while we are chasing after the bird in the branch."
Zeybekci also stated that green passports will be issued to exporters later, "One of the last decisions, which is its law, and we have now finished its regulation in the economy ministry; approximately, we will give the privileged green passport representing this country to our exporter, approximately 17 to 20 thousand exporters as of the first figures."
"THESE CLEANING FROM THE STATE"
Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet ÅžimÅŸek, who mentioned the July 15 coup attempt and the state of emergency declared after, said, "But it is behind us, we need to move forward now."
"Of course, those involved in this uprising need to clear the state of this coup attempt, and this process is working, but more importantly, serious administrative reforms were needed to avoid such coup attempts again," he said.
As a climate needed for these administrative reforms, the State of Emergency has been declared, and so far very serious structural reforms have been made.
"We, of course, have acted within the democratic principles and the state of law, while we are doing all this, we will continue to do so," he said.
ÅžimÅŸek, who stated that life has returned to normal in many areas, stressed that there is no reason for companies and individuals who have not been involved in financing terrorism.
ÅžimÅŸek, who expressed that Turkey's democracy has strengthened, said, "I think the foundations of Turkey's democracy have been strengthened, because when you look at the origin of the recent problems, you will surely see that this network of betrayals is involved.
"Therefore, the removal of this terrorist organization from the state and the closure of this period in Turkey will strengthen Turkey's democracy," he said.
ÅžimÅŸek stated that the foundations of the economy are generally solid and that they returned to normal structural reform agendas without losing any time. "Turkey has returned to its main agenda, there is progress in structural reforms."
Structural reforms are already essential because populism, protectionism is increasing in the world.
"Turkey can only prepare for the future by reforming," he said.
Lastly, ÅžimÅŸek emphasized that Turkey will not break away from the West. "Turkey may be at disagreements with our western allies and friends from time to time, but Turkey does not break away from the West, it does not give up the European Union."
He jumped from 25 meters to the sea and...

Having difficulty moving at sea, BayrakÃ§Ä± was taken ashore by his professional swimmer friends like him.
The paramedics, who came to the scene on the tip, took Åžamil Tayyar BayrakÃ§Ä± to Antalya Training and Research Hospital by ambulance.
It was noted that BayrakÃ§Ä±, who was treated, had no life-threatening danger.
"When I jumped from Eagle Hill, a friend of BayrakÃ§Ä±'s statements to the police, his neck was hurt."
"We didn't know it was going to happen," he said.

Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will offer renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and London, but also across the country.
I think it will make Heathrow very attractive, as in London 2012, where we made an incredible effort to benefit all nations and territories from the Games.
The Olympics had great advantages for Stratford and the East End.
And we're going to make it happen again by creating opportunities for local people and firms near Heathrow.
10,000 new internship opportunities for our local communities alone will create 40,000 new jobs, and we will not leave unemployed young people around the airport.
As before London 2012, there will be those who think that the struggle to expand Heathrow is too difficult.
I was told that Britain would never prepare for the Games and we would be disgraced to the whole world.
Those who were suspicious were mistaken in 2012, and they will also be mistaken about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers all questions asked.
As in the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few people.
The expansion has the opportunity to create 18,000 new jobs and 211 billion economic growth, and many skills and jobs both around and around the airport and across the UK.
In Heathrow, we have a great team that implements a timely and budget-worthy infrastructure investment for a timely and budget-friendly infrastructure investment for T2, from T5 to T2 (the world's busiest two tracks) from T5 (recommendation for five consecutive years).
We are now ready to offer a third runway supported by a private investment worth 16 billion.
The London 2012 Games were a great success for the UK, and I have no doubt that the Heathrow expansion would be like.
It's time for us to secure our commercial future by channeling this Olympic spirit to the expansion of Heathrow and create many skills and job opportunities that Britain will be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors of Heathrow and former Secretary of Commerce of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook ad blocking "like a cat-mouse game"
It resembles the "kedi-mouse game" according to one of the companies that make attempts to block ads for companies that make money from online advertising.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on the desktop site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that its users could update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook said ad blockers would change the codes around the ads to make it difficult for the page to determine which part of the page is ads.
But now Adblock says he's cracking new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this forward struggle between the community of blocking open source advertising and those who are trying to prevent them has been since the introduction of advertising blocking has been since the invention," and it is possible for Facebook to produce its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered this struggle shows how much concern the advertising blockers pose for the industry.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair and Adobe last year, about 200 million people globally use ad blockers, four times the number of people using this type of software in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook with mobile devices, mobile ads now account for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
According to a spokesman, mobile ad blockers are not effective on Facebook's mobile apps for the social network and Instagram, so the company is pursuing ad blockers on its desktop.
Since Facebook considers this kind of move worth investing, desktop ads should still be in a position to provide sufficient income.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update the "advertising preferences" tool so that people can better control the ads offered to them.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock's new filters were alarming, blocking some of the non-advertisement content on the site.
"We do not offer these people a good experience and we plan to deal with this problem," a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail statement.
Advertising blockers are dulled, so we are focused on creating tools such as Advertising Preferences to give control to people.
A woman ran into the Swiss highway; it looks like suicide
The victim was lying on the highway at midnight.
Police are looking for people who witnessed a few vehicles hit him on the highway early Thursday in the case of suicide.
The incident occurred in the Vaud canton in the A1 near Morges, just after midnight Thursday.
Vaud police said in a statement that the woman "unhopedless" in the dark of the night and several vehicles hit him.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman, who was clearly trying to kill herself, was hit by a few vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Police said several of the drivers involved had been interviewed, but some were undetectable, and asked them and everyone involved in the incident to contact them.
Lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve that "a criminal prosecution has been opened as a "reasonable" step to be taken in situations like this."
However, it is not yet known whether the drivers involved in the incident will face any charges.
Was it possible to avoid collision?
That's what the prosecutor should have identified," Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases over the past five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.
In both cases (both included a person on the highway in the dark), it was ruled that it was normal for drivers not to wait for a pedestrian on the highway at midnight.
Last year, in August 2014, a police officer who crashed a man lying on the road near Paynerne in A1 was found not guilty of causing his death due to negligence.
The court said the 22-year-old victim was drunk and leaked down the road.
The court said the police officer, who responded to an emergency call, used the vehicle reasonably, and that finding a man on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation".
Those who have information about this incident near Morges on Thursday should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once suitable for living
According to the estimates of the new NASA climate model, there were once conditions for life in Venus.
Scientists at the NASA Goddard Institute of Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus's past using tools and algorithms similar to what climatic scientists use.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus was home to conditions similar to Earth with its hot, water-free surface and CO2 atmosphere.
Scientists had described Venus's low rotation rate with a thick layer of atmosphere.
But the latest estimates suggest that Venus may have a thin, Earth-like atmosphere and can still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
Although the planet has more dry zones than Earth, it may have once been protected against sufficient water and rapid evaporation with geographical variability.
The old Venus also benefited from a dim sun by 30 percent.
"In the simulation of theGISS model, the slow return of Venus allowed the day side to be facing the sun for almost two months," said GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a news bulletin.
This warmed the surface, leading to rains that form thick cloud layers that moved like an umbrella that protected the surface from sun-induced warming.
As a result, only a few degrees clauses emerged from Earth today, with only a few degrees of colder climate temperatures.
The model created a story similar to the evolution that planet scientists had previously proposed as a hypothesis for Venus.
Although it once had conditions for life, Venus was exposed to a lot of heat and ultraviolet light over a few billion years.
Their oceans evaporated and the water vapour burned to the ground with ultraviolet ray.
Hydrogen is exhausted, and there's only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse gas effect, Venus, as we know it today.
Researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy resigns as Avalanche antenna
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday as Colorado Avalanche coach and vice-president of hockey operations, stating that the team was not given a say in the decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, the Colorado vice-president/general director, approved this development and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have performed my duties as head coach and hockey operations vice-presidential in Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination," said 50-year-old Roy.
During the summer, I've been thinking a long time since I've given this team the depth it needs, how I can improve it and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the vision of coach and VP hockey operations must be in perfect harmony with the vision of the organization.
He also needs to have a say in decisions that affect the performance of the team.
In the present situation, these conditions have not yet been met.
Sakic, who recruited Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contributions to the team.
Sakic said, "Patrick informed me of his decision today."
We thank him for everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was awarded the Jack Adams Award for Best Coach in the league with Avalanche in his first season in 2013-14.
He scored 112 points for the club and led the team to win the league, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the first round of the play-offs, and missed the post-season games every two years.
In 2015-16, Avalanche beat the 39-39-4 target, and at the Western Conference, he scored five points less than necessary for the second joker area.
Roy, the goalkeeper on the Honors List, won four Stanley Cups, two for the Montreal Canadiens, both for Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations by suspending strike
The strike of the North Sea oil workers was suspended due to the wages, and the chief negotiators began discussions on a new round of talks.
The strike against the oilfield service company Wood Group is gradually carried out on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"As Unions and the Unione and RMT unions, we have decided to re-start the process for the settlement of the current dispute," a joint statement said.
In the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, we're going to hold a series of meetings that will take all day to adopt a new perspective on problems.
Labor unions said the protest was the first to do so in 25 years against wage cuts that could reach 30 per cent.
This year, the Wood Group cut approximately 9 per cent of payments to contractors in the North Sea due to negative pressures in the market.
In 2014, the company's contractors were reduced by a 10% price reduction in the company's wage reduction process.
The company said additional cuts would provide the company with the necessary space to go through the troubled period in the market.
Shell laid off thousands of people while separating operations during the merger with the British energy company BG Group and announced plans to abandon oil and gas operations in the country up to 10.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low-crude oil prices, an economic situation caused by Britain's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Parliamentary Member Dave Anderson will meet with workers' leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the North Sea.
As he said, the North Sea is vital for the regional economy.
"We need an effective economy for the majority, not for the minority across the North Sea and across the country," he said in a statement.
Despite an average investment of around $7 billion over the past five years, in 2016, new projects in the North Sea are expected to be invested less than $1.4 billion.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of the stars in Ãœlker constellations
The Kepler space telescope helped astronomers create the most complete catalog in terms of rotational speeds of stars in the Ãœlker constellator.
New data helps astronomers understand why the stars in the constellation rotate at varying speed and their return periods are related to planetary formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, said in a news bulletin, "When we compare our results with star clusters, we hope to learn more about the relationship between the mass, age of a star, and even the history of the solar system."
The country star is 445 light-years from Earth.
Most of the stars in the constellation formed 125 million years ago and reach the new level of new adulthood.
They rotate at the highest possible speed throughout their lives.
At peak rotation speeds, the stars in this maturation phase form a large amount of star wind.
As these winds progress in the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a refraction effect on the stars.
As a star ages, the speed of rotation begins to decrease.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotation of each star by following the time between the appearance of noticeable star spots such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that larger stars rotate faster than small stars.
Rebull, comparing the stars to dancers, stated that the large ones perform their returns on one foot more slowly than those smaller.
"We see that those who turn slow in the country's 'bale' are much heavier and the ones who rotate fast are very light stars," Rebull said.
Since the country star is very close, it acts as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparing star features and rotational speeds.
Rebull said, "The country's constellation provides theoretical models for star rotations in both directions as young and old."
There's more to what we want to know about how the rotational speeds of the stars fall, when and why they're dropping, so to speak, why they put their 'dance shoes' in a corner.
Rebull and colleagues explained the latest analysis of the Ulker constellator's rotational speeds in detail in three new articles to be published in the Journal of Astronomy in a short time.
