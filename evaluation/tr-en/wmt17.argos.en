Assistant doctors strike: New job slowing calls
Representatives of Asian doctors asked the unions to slow down work, in relation to the dispute about a new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Assistant Doctors Committee (JDC) was called to support more work slowing action than September.
JDC expresses that ministers can’t get any concerns about the contract.
Assistant doctors and medical students used the rejection of the contract agreement with BMA.
This was rejected by 58% of members who voted.
On Thursday night in a post published on Twitter, the President of JDC Ellen McCourt noted that the government remains "quick" in terms of problems caused by the rejection of the contract.
He said: "In the light of this, the JDC Board voted in the direction of rejecting the proposed new contract with the entire and found in the call of restarting official negotiations on concerns.  "
In response to the silence of the government, JDC management found a formal request to allow the BMA Board to slow work from September.
. has caused the assistant doctors to participate in six strikes, which includes the first round of the first ball on NHS this year.
Assistant doctor leader Dr. BMA Johann Malawana resigned the contract conditions proposed by BMA.

Russia and Turkey: Is a ‘non-condium alliance’?
This is a gesture that ends the attack.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met together to announce that the eight-month war that was officially terminated with words and economic sanctions on Tuesday.
Vladimir Putin St. I was greeted the Turkish partner in the showroom of the St Petersburg Palace, and I was covered with the impression of the person who wants this compromise is Ankara.
Hand bored, yes.
But Mr Putin’s smile was quite weak and couldn’t say that even against their limited standards emit any temperature.
On the contrary, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan repeatedly mentioned "good-friendly" Mr Putin; five times according to a report.
I was surprised by the number.
He promised that Russia and relations will not be returned to the pre-crisitor, reaching much higher levels.
The next day, in a newspaper here, Mr Erdoğan was expressed to be nothing bad.
I think that the excitement of himself turned out to be full.
But Mr. Putin’s cold intiba said that Russia’s leader didn’t forget anything.
In fact, the first thing he spoke in the statement he did in the opening was the cause of the crisis: Turkey’s Syrian border to hit the Russian war aircraft.
Then the reaction of Russia was full of hiddet.
Mr Putin blamed Ankara with knifeing Moscow from his back by making a hard exit.
The jealousy was much greater, it was believed that the opposite party is friendly.
It will be difficult to rebuild trust in real sense, perhaps impossible.
Since November, the idea of the Russian people has changed.
The media in state control aimed at Ankara in a sagging and offensive way.
Aniden was the guilty of everything.
The most serious of them were accusations in the direction of the illegal oil trade, performed in the areas under the control of the so-called Islamic State in Syria, Mr Erdoğan’s family.
His own refused to be exact.
However, the official message from St. Petersburg was the time to continue the road.
Finally, the reason for the realization of this meeting was that Mr Putin requested from President Erdoğan.
Russia can see it as a kind of victory.
The benefits that will provide firefighting call for Ankara are very clear.
First of all, Erdoğan needs friends after the failed blow, which will take place last month and cause almost overturn.
The duplicate terror attacks in Turkey have also affected itself quite.
Also effective in economic reasons.
The sanctions of Russia have been tight; especially every year the ban of private flights carrying several million Russian tourists to the coastal regions of Turkey.
This number dropped almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and rental companies have absolutely relaxed with the fact that flights will continue.
In the event that the end of the season in the Mediterranean has been attached to its density.
And this week, state television, Turkish agricultural products have been predicted that it will be reduced in fruit and vegetable prices with the reapproval of imports.
If we will quote from a news in Vedemosti newspaper "Turists there, tomatoes here".
However, a separate political value for Moscow was also available.
Ankara is angry to West because it doesn’t find the response to impact interference.
When the talks about joining the U.S. have been added for a long time due to the progress in the snail speed, Mr. Putin who want to take advantage of the breakage of bonds with the West of Turkey and the coldness in the meantime.
Due to the call for the support of selected authorities after the Russian leading pulse attempt, it definitely seems to sum up sympathy from Ankara.
It is necessary to remember that it was a inevitable attitude to Moscow, which also carries a rooted fear on regime change.
This peak, which was held in the palace with this show on the sea, represents a "undium alliance" in the way Russia and Turkey explained me by a analyst: It combines the forces of two countries where the West refuses and acts badly.
Despite the image of this flower, they are quite different from each other.
One of the most important of them is about Syria: Russia and Turkey support different parties if Moscow shows itself as mediator.
After the first interviews lasted almost three hours, it also supports it to say that two others are not mentioned in the press conference.
President of Turkey clearly avoided answering a question about these differences, Mr Putin chose to draw their gold.
There is no clear consensus on how to determine common ground in Syria.
However, months are clearly maintained after the husumetten - and Nato member when Turkey’s Russian war jet hits and dropping the absolute disaster potential that arises - it’s absolutely good development that two leaders begin to speak at least.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is destroyed for customers outside Scotland
According to the statement of the Bank Executive Board, RBS brand will pass to the back office position.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be destroyed for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan expressed that the brand RBS to BBC Scotland is associated with global targets of the bank.
Eight years ago it was left in the case of withdrawal and abandonment of them since it came to almost the state of freezing.
During this time, brand strategy experts used 'RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
This was supported with millions of pounds for many sponsorships from the six NGO champion to the Wimbledon Andy Murray champion.
But now, it was decided that more national brands will be right to stand out.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will not be used by Scottish customers but new starters will not be done.
All in the UK and Wales will be changed as NatWest, except for the conditions of quoting the central and exchange.
Ulster Bank brand is currently used for customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are also smaller brands to undertake a much more dominant task for individual banking; Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan interviewed a tour held for customers and staff in Inverness-shire.
BBC Scotland said: "We will no longer be a bank consisting of more brands after that, our RBS brand investor brand and our staff will not be a brand that is employed.  "
As the bank itself becomes a global brand, RBS has become global brand.
Now I say it is not global, our local goals.
Each of these brands will stand out slightly differently in the community, and our staff will work under the name of these brands with customers.
RBS had announced that six NGO champions were not going to be sponsored and raising the profile of different brands in sports sponsorship.
The head of the Executive Board came to the understanding of the "Artist brands bank because (we asked ourselves) said how we can make a better bank for customers?"
Three years ago we had a great bank for our customers, and I found that we can sing it.
However, I think you can see a lot of changes with our focus on the needs of customers, not our work and ourselves.
We can re-activate these brands, so I think this is the right time.

President of Russia Putin received his special pencil Sergey
Russian President Vladimir Putin received his private pencil Sergei Ivanov unexpectedly task.
Mr. Ivanov was part of the close circle of Mr Putin trusted for many years.
63-year-old, now called special representative for environmental and transportation problems.
In a statement made from the Kremlin, Mr Putin expressed "Ivanov's decision to finalize the Russian governor, but no reason was given.
For this position, Anton Vaino was appointed to Mr Ivanov since 2012.
Vaino, which is 44 years old, is an old diplomat.
In 1972, the capital of Estonia was born in Tallinn, graduated from the International Relations of the well-known Moscow State Institute (MGIMO) and served in Tokyo Embassy.
Then the presidential protocol and government staff were interested in the administration; the statements on the Kremlin website are such (Russian).

At the end of the 1990’s, Mr. Putin was at the head of the Federal Security Force (FSB), Mr. Ivanov said to him.
When Mr Putin went to power, he showed Ivanov as one of the five most trusted people.

Queensferry Pass: Bridge now connects to Fife
1,35 billion £ value project must be completed until May 2017
Engineers joined the north of the Queensferry Pass and the miner, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four closures between the "layer fans", which is to be completed around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The cross section from Fife of the bridge weighs 600 meters long and 30,000 tons.
consist of 46 support cables with 10.000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons concrete.
1,35 billion £ value project must be completed until May 2017.
Minister of Economy Keith Brown was one of the first people who walk to the bridge by visiting the premises today.
He said: "This is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queensferry Gateway.
We are all witnessed to engineers in real sense with this project which is used concrete on 30,000 tons for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the exceptional size and weight of the bridge that closes the cavity between the Viyaduk and the bridge tabliness, it is a delicate study that requires extremely precise tolerances for this fit.
In general, almost 79% of the total bridge tabular, the concrete casting of the first cross-section of the discharger will be held in Rosyth today, which means that the entire discharge will be ready to be lifted on the bridge.
Forth Passed and Bridge Contractors project director Michael Martin said: "In all bridge projects, the first closing is always an important milestone.
In this extraordinary project, this closing represents a pioneer in construction engineering.
After the installation of the last highway tabular and connecting to the expanding North Tower level, we had to close the gap on the north - or land-side.
This was carried out in the south up to 700 millimeters from the north.
This is very big but also very sensitive.
The reason for being large was that it weighs nearly 6000 tons in length of 222 meters, and it was necessary to withdraw it at about 3% slope.
The reason for being sensitive was that the tolerance values required to comply with the team are very low; from both sides to just a few millimeters.
Luckily everything went on the road.
Moelfre Bay rescue team: Lucky because three guys are in the ‘fortunate’
Three guys are lucky for they stay in the "forgetful" after they fall from the fishing boat in Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI cankurtaran filika station alarmed on Friday, after the device sees the case in Moelfre Bay, at 13:20 with British summer time.
Three men were striving to swim towards a safe area while moving on their own way.
Moelfre cankurtaran sapling controller said "We saw that the ball draws the right apartments to them, and we were worried."

A valuable type of hunting for health and happiness, Pokémon Go
It’s really surprised to see how the world has changed.
Teens and children are no longer going out to play the game, prefering to spend their leisure time looking at screens, for the past decade, most people were timidated.
Pokemon Go encourages people to move from sofa.
When spent looking at screens, it was mainly spread to video games and finally to smartphones when it is limited to television.
That’s why it’s really great to see if it’s not the elements that move technology and outdoors.
Of course, I’m talking about Pokémon Go, an app based on characters (which was later created for video game in 90s, then turned into cartoons, game cards and other side products).
Like a lot of cases of popular culture, this new game had joined the midst in the US, Australia and New Zealand early July.
Afterwards, the presentation in other countries was delayed due to the intense interest caused by overloading on servers.
In days more than Pokémon Go Tinder and almost reach the same number of users with Twitter.
How does it work?
If you need to explain in short, players get their smartphones, they are looking for Pokémon as tracked by GPS, and they can attract 'photos' (with screenshot on the phone) or they can't get them.
The game joined this craze by sofa for a generation of a generation playing in younger ages.
In the U.S., the game provided a significant increase in the number of steps a person jumps every day.
Cardiogram, an app developed for Apple Watch, and following 35,000 users, expressed that the rate of 30 days of workouts every day between those who follow in the next two days before offering the game to Washington Post.
The company does not know who are playing Pokémon Go; it can only see raw data at exercise level.
Most public health campaign, which encourages people "time separation of 30 minutes", "blogging out" and "active every day", were ignored because most public health messages are boring and transmitted by people who appear fair.
But still less if the importance of exercise is highlighted.
Individuals who regularly exercise are reduced the possibility of cancer or depression.
The exercise provides help in matters such as weight control, high blood pressure and diabetes and has a long list of benefits that will not be listed here.
But Pokémon Go’s beauty is out to do something they enjoy.
In this way, three basic elements of health are met: movement, clean air and entertainment with sunlight.
Some people can even get new friends during hunting.
As usual, there are also unconventional playouts looking for something to complain.
And of course someone can also multiply the door while walking.
What does it notice?
A great innovation is presented.
Although smart phone apps like Fitbit monitor our movement, it did not give us a reason to exercise like this game.
The effect of innovation will pass and the use will also be reduced over time.
However, due to the success of Pokémon, applications and virtual reality will be taken in many games that help people who come home to be more active, form and healthy through combining with activities in the real world.

Simone Biles covered gold medal in general assessment of female gymnastics
Forget the print.
Forget excitement.
Simone Biles has immunity to all of them.
Dynamic in jumping.
Comfortable in balance tool.
Stunning with the ground.
Excellence in the head.
And he is now a Olympic champion.
19-year-old American gymnast has clearly exhibited the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympics by completing the overall assessment on Thursday.
Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medal owner Aliya Mustafina, who received 62,198 points, silver medals and friend from the "Last Five" team.
Simone Biles from the United States, on Thursday, held in Brazil in 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, the female articulated gymnastics in the final evaluation of the balance instrument.
Biles was the fourth and generally fifth American woman who received the general assessment award to the back and announced its name as the best of its generation and perhaps all times.
When the last total was published, it was drowned into tears and the long trip it came to achieve this master ended.
This success took the sport to the same level with athletes such as Michael Phelps, which can be seen once in every generation that delivers to new levels:
Biles has spent his last three years as one of the most successful in this sport with its 15 world champion medals and the Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton’s self-containing routines with stunning routines and tenders.
A final test in Brazil was waiting for him; this competition was among other people in the field with Biles and among the load formed by large expectations.
Teksas will be seen as a disappointment from a handful of gold medals to the family house in Spring.
Simone Biles from the United States, left, and Aly Raisman, held in Brazil in 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Olympics, artistic gymnastics women in the general assessment of gold and silver medals respectively, Thursday, Aug.
Biles won his first on Tuesday that he worked as a sign of the national team emekli Martha Karolyi and ünlem in his party.
Even though it’s not exactly true if it’s insisting that it’s never looking forward in this long run towards the peak of Biles.
The part of the plug-in transition that has become the icon of the ground exercise routine is prepared with Latin music, which will fully adapt to the street outside of the Rio Olympic Arena.
This is not a coincidence.
The girl discovered by Boorman’s mother, who was adopted in a smaller child by the big mother and his grandfather, and was discovered by the mother of Boorman, in the trip to a gym in which Aimee Boorman had coached.
Since 2013, he did not lose any of the general assessments, which should continue as long as he wants to know.
Mustafina was temporary if he undertakes leadership in two rotations.
Balance tool and place exercises that Biles’s world champion have not been done yet.
In the balance tool, 15,433 points were prominent and crowned it with 15,933 points in place exercise.
Raisman was slightly wrapped to him, while waiting for the last score, and the vision of Biles once written on a blackbook, while the bright red, white and blue eyes were determined around the makeup.
Raisman’s performance was like the ruffle of the previous performance of four years, when he shared the fourth but then lost the bronze medal to Mustafina.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain of Americans called "nine".
Time time sent a kiss to the crowd after the exercise where it was overcome with a return that appears suspicious.
For 19-year-old Biles, the very shared tweet that this week jumped at the beginning of this week can now say that it has a completely new understanding:
Police: 3 victims in the case of mass killer, shot while listening to music in the car
Phoenix’s first series killer case for ten years, two women and 12-year-old girl children were hit by talking on the car according to police reports published on Thursday and listening to music.
Authors, Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter expressed that Maleah was applied on a garage path on 12 June.
The report is expressed that the armed person burns eight hands with the pistol while standing on the passenger side of the car and gets away from another vehicle.
The police says this three murder does not appear for robbery purposes because the attacker did not receive the handbags of adult victims or 2,900 dollars.
The Phoenix police spokesperson Commissioner Jonathan Howard said that the researchers of the armed attack are connected with the previous four attacks.
In four months, seven people died in total in nine attacks, mainly in the neighborhoods where Spanish origins live, and two people were injured.
Howard, at the beginning of this month, found in the description of "This was in the settlement area in front of a house."
The brown Nissan in the right model for the late 1990s is thought to use a few tools, including black BMW and a white Cadillac or Lincoln in the late 1990s.
The researchers refused to explain evidence that attacks are related to the same killer and are concluded by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was removed to the hospital due to injuries and then lost his life.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter lost life in Maleah event place.
A person who has witnessed the incident said that the police did not have an unusual situation of listening to music by sitting in the car that people parked.
The authorities also published a police report on the fire event targeting an empty truck half an hour before three murders.
The researchers found bullet hives, took a bullet from a seat and detected bullet particles in the engine compartment.
6-year-old microbial patient's mother: "It's better"
Like most six-year-old children, Edmund Picciuto also loves singing, toys and of course also her mother.
However, unlike peers there is a microcephalus disorder in Edmund, this is a genetic disorder that the mother Elizabeth Picciuto is not aware of its presence during pregnancy.
When Eve came first, my first thought was that I couldn’t do it.
I cannot do it.
I didn’t want it.
These are of course not true, of course, you like it.
He said that Edmund can never recognize them, and even survive.
Some doctors went forward until they will offer depositing to the home of care.
Picciuto "My first reaction was to say that people did not think about it anymore."
Edmund can walk with the help of a coach.
Edmund couldn’t sit upright until three years old or did not work and still can’t talk.
However, it slowly reaches some milestones.
You can walk by taking help and ride on the bike.
He also loves playing games with two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth demonstrates the sign language that Edmund satellites to say "say me song."
Picciuto said to CBS News, "We are teaching the language of the mark".
But as we know this, it says Edmund’s own signs.
Microcephalus can occur due to a number of different situations; a genetic condition such as Edmund can be present and can be caused by infections formed by viruses such as fried and Zika during pregnancy.
Symptoms and course of the disease can vary very large.
It is much earlier to say how people with Zika infection will affect their life from this case.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden that the future creates ambiguity.
I’m constantly asking what will be.
What will be?
And he still does not know it.
In fact, I didn’t ask me a question about the course of the disease for a long time I didn’t expect anyone to really say.
But Picciuto is in the case that babies who are born due to Zika can offer hopeful advice for their mothers.
It’s better.
You know it will be better for you.
You will love your child, your child will also love you.

Simone is the reason why we need Gabby and Laurie
Women of this year wear this name to the Olympic Gymnastic Team and there are more reasons for it.
First of all, I joined all Summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been dominant before.
Secondly: This team has three gymnasts inspired by many girls with different ethnic origins: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez.
The structure of this team brought together by Jewish Aly Raisman and Catholic Madison Kocian is proud of everyone.
The team exhibits a similar look at America at the end.
It also strengthens the presence of black and Latin origin women in the upper levels of this sport.
In the past four years, the first female gymnasticsist was always an American of African origin.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were ranked 1 and 2.
This is something strong.
In the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic champion and supported him in America.
Now, Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, which is the three World Championships of the world, can witness extraordinary performances of gymnastics routines, which are unexpected but skillfully exhibited.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to the back of gold medal winner in the general assessment of women.
And team friend Aly Raisman also won silver medal.
We recognize the best time of this sport but the situation does not seem like this in the gym courses across the country.
Simone watched the same way as Aly and Madison to be included in the Olympic teams of Gabby and Laurie.
The reason for being "Last Five" is that in the next Olympic gymnastics team only will be four gymnasiums and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi will coach.
But in reality, gymnastics is a highly cost-effective sports and gymnasians first work in training, travel, forum, contest, hotel fees (for teachers, gymnasians and families) and private gym clubs supported by many more fees.
Most of these gym clubs are located in the suburban neighborhoods that can deny these businesses.
These clubs require a cost and long-term commitment for families of single-site and gymns where gymnastics can be trained.
Simone Biles's coach Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez's coach Maggie Haney have been trained since the day they started to jimnasti.
Simone does not provide more affordable and accessible gymnastics training to communities for numerous young girls affected by Gabby and Laurie.
I set up my own gymnastics preacher 20 years ago.
In my organizations, gence over 15,000 in the city based on Harlem (previously black and Hispanic) offered free and low cost gymnastics training and coaching both national and international champions.
In September, we will expand Detroit (where I see) to learn this wonderful Olympic sport and provide quality gymnastics training to young people who deserve the opportunity to benefit from it.
Gymnastic improves the strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and provides mentally stringent work, discipline and stability characteristics.
This combination offers long-term advantages in terms of health, school and success.
Thousands of young girls will be inspired by this team, which will lead to jimnasti, and this is a great thing.
Participation in sports activities is very important especially for girls.
We really pass through exciting times.
Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison’s Olympic team, bringing gold medals to “The Strength of the Girls” clearly show and thanks many young girls with different backgrounds to be a healthy, strong and successful young woman.
After the rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s proposal, assistant doctors decided to continue strikes
Ministers hoped that the British Medical Association would end the dispute after the agreement was agreed on the contract developed with the officers, but the 37,000 assistant doctor who joined the vote gave 58 percent of the doctor.
In July, Mr. Hunt announced plans for the implementation of sanctions relating to the contract by expressing that NHS is "not the property of the state" and does not suffer more delays.
The first assistant doctor group passed the new contract with changes in work applications at night and weeks to improve maintenance outside normal hours.
BMA’s assistant doctors’ committee head Dr. Ellen McCourt said yesterday in the declaration of the night: "There are still serious concerns about the proposed contract of doctors; especially those who think that it will trigger the current labor crisis and not be adopted an equal attitude to all doctors.  "
It is necessary to provide progress in this process that remains only eight weeks for the new contract of the first doctor group and to expire from time.
BMA’s efforts in solving the dispute were met with the unwilling silence of the government and in some cases, in which they are in the case of interaction.
This is a development seen though Jeremy Hunt will always be open last month.
"Jeremy Hunt is moving immediately, it is necessary to remove sanctions and hear the concerns of assistant doctors.  "
Asistan doctors clearly express that they are prepared in order to increase work slowing actions if they do not.
In the last strike at the end of April, almost 13.000 routine operation and 100,000 appointments were delayed, nurses and consultants had to look at the substitute of doctors on the strike line.
Ministers hoped that the British Association of Medical Association would end the dispute after the agreement was agreed on.
BMA wants to improve on weekend fees for the 54,000 assistant doctor in the contract.
NHS Employers executive director Daniel Mortimer called assistant doctors to implement any strike.
Mr. Mortimer said: "Grev does not solve anything but it causes anxiety, discomfort and trouble for patients, caregivers and families by creating pressure on team and services that are intense in the form.  "
For the past two months, we continued our interviews with the Assistant Doctors Committee, and with the Ministry of Health and other authorities, we are positively approaching the concerns about the Decentralization Officer and the Ihbarda Finding.
Employers, important topics - distribution, training flexibility, additional training for those who call their careers, education costs, mutual understanding in curriculum, training reason, and as well as gender salary difference in medicine - it was hopeful of maintaining positive communication in relation to employers, which act in compliance with the agreements that were reached by BMA on November, February, and May, as a sign of how seriously the UK Medical Education and the Ministry of Health.
The drug that can eliminate the risk of heart attacks at 2 times a day
Thousands of heart attacks patients can benefit from 2£ per day after referral to more people for longer periods.
ticagrelor, which prevents constipation, reduces the risk of recurring crisis for people with heart discomfort.
The drug was given for 12 months following the heart attack and decreased the risk of stroke or other crisis.
NHS observer suggested NICE to give people for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, now the NHS observer suggested NICE to give people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Every year, 140.000 people in the UK pass the heart attack and one in the four of them is another crisis or paralysis.
The cause of heart crises and strokes is the creation of plaque on the artery walls by combining fat substances.
If the placenta is shredded, this can cause blood clots and prevent the blood from going to the heart attack.
And if the clot is removed from the bloodstream, it consists of paralysis in the case of preventing blood flow.
The risk of spending another crisis is higher than those who have previously passed a crisis.
The UK firm was created by AstraZeneca by Brilique commercial name, Ticagrelor reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of clots.
The NICE guideline published today recommends people to give 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, and then 60 mg of application together with aspirin twice a day for three years.
Professor Carole Longson, an executive at the center of NICE health technology assessment, said: "Despite the fact that secondary prevention treatments are available, the heart attackers spend up to four other heart attacks or strokes, and often their results are devastating.  "
The fear of reconciliation can create a rather negative effect on the quality of the person’s life.
Deliller shows that the use of ticagrelor with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of recurring heart attacks and strokes in people who have already passed the heart attack.
We are pleased to increase the treatment options offered to thousands of people who are waiting for this to be temporarily recommended.
More than three years of information about the effectiveness and safety of the Ticagrelor - because it is limited to the risk of bleeding in the head, the guide draft is not available in the treatment proposal after this period.

Travelers took the language for Ian Wright travel guide to Europe’s most nasty places
British traveler suffered from a serious test of immune system and ow reflex by licking some of Europe’s most filthy and oblique spots.
Server and travel writer, Suffolklu Ian Wright (51), a Euro banknote to prove the power of the immune system, a Piccadily Sirki durabzanı, a train toilet's siphon button and drove to an an antle phone in Russia.
It used a luminometer to show that each object has been infected with him and what kind of work.
But the experiment, which will be converted into a film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, gave some surprising results.
Although the thought of licking the siphon button on a train used by thousands of people is extremely obscurable, there is actually much worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Mr. Wright met with doctors and medical experts in relation to the increase and health of stomach bacteria throughout the trip in Europe.
Luckily, nothing he had lying in the mouth did not create an effect except for the bad taste left.
Mr. Wright is believed to test the durability of the stomach by visiting the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
This task in a wide range from general sparks to toilet siphonu buttons from train stations, definitely tested the immune system
I said this in the film about it: I didn’t have a lot of attention to my health since my childhood, and I put many things from the soil to worm and mud water.’
During the film period, this reputation proved precisely.
The only thing reddetics was a nasty public toilet in Russia.
The sample of the product showed luminometer count on 4000 units.
In need to compare; in newly washed hands, this number should be below 60.
But while under 60 in newly washed hands, the luminometer count was a Russian public toilet where it refuses to lick over 4000 units
Mr. Wright and Fin milk products manufacturer Governoro has undertaken the construction of The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, showing the number of bacteria in different places such as bath
In his own movie, he said: ‘It is close to being one of the worst things I smelled in a toilet.’
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I’m not going to emit anything because it’s inside.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was prepared with the Governoro of the Finnish dairy products manufacturer.
The company provided the Governoro Gefilus, which includes C and D vitamins, which helps strengthen lactic acid bacteria as well as stomach bacteria and immune system.
Governoro’s Snacks, Fruit Waters and New Categories Division Senior Vice President Niko Vuorenmaa said: "We wanted to present really a new thing to the participants.
It’s something that’s impressive to monitor and will also explain the benefits of probiotics.
At the end, we have made many wild brainstorms that the idea "I met Ian."
They claim that interest in stomach health becomes a global phenomenon
Instead of talking just about products, we wanted to put products into a much larger binding; good and bad bacteria in our surroundings daily, the importance of stomach health and connection with this immune system.
The interest in stomach health is becoming a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can give consumers more insight into this situation.
I also think that the movie has a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who manages the movie, added: "I'm going to say with it; Ian lost my respect against him that I wanted to lie like the Russian toilet in the movie.'
Some were quite difficult if it was easy to lick some things naturally.
I am happy to get some of these nasty licking actions.'
In a survey conducted by Governoro in 2015, 84 percent of participants associate lactic acid bacteria with stomach health and expressed that products containing 58 percent of lactic acid bacteria are used at least intermittently.

Vinyl target: Who are the areas of buying plates?
Middle old, only men are looking for vinyl.
Let’s say that the Messenger of the MuslimMale is based on the real data of this statement before we go to the comment section to make amazing insults under our head.
According to YouGov, the return of plaques, which are a very mentioned topic, is not a consequence of the ancient nostalgia of the middle age.
Recent areas of buying vinyl albums are mainly between 45 and 54 years.
If you look at the same, the lowest probability of 18-24 years.
This is not only sourced from the action of accumulation of curious; it has a emotional care; older vinyl receivers often love to store their feelings (56% and 75%) and enjoy staying alone (69% and %66) people.
What are the results of YouGov?
If this blog was a news published in television, in a crowded street of the camera Soho, while walking with a modest gray suit, many gestures before stopping and connecting my hands, he followed when saying something authority like this: "O let's take a look at it time.  "
Then, let's take a look.
While Soho’s central gradually loses its spells and unusual weather (where buildings with independent vendors are now full of hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchases) are still available in several specialized plaque stores.
I probably wanted to stand out from the camera for the next part, I tried to learn about age and emotional situations through observing some of these stores near different men.
From Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle old man) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle old men, probably a woman in 20 years), followed by the Glasgow Stuart (55), who followed the afternoon for a meeting, spends in London and browse stores to fill the empty few hours.
I ask a collection.
"I'm like that."
I have about 3000 or 4000 sheets.
These plaques (pictured me by email, I did not follow him up to the house) decorate the walls of the living room.
This is because of numerous albums and single collection, a result of partially paid income; it is now able to get plaques that the money is not enough when it comes first and buy them back in young and unqualified times.
"At the beginning of the 70s of the end of most 60s, I say that things that came when I was 11 or 12 years old; I am very young to get."
Plaid is interested in the thought that the areas of buying are not alone, which is high in the possibility of being introverted people: "I do not drink alcohol, too alcohol.
This is my bad birdium.
Wez (25), working at Sister Ray, thinks that most of the customers faced at YouGov profile.
However, he also noticed that people who come back to this fashion need to buy old plates back.
I figured out that in the interviews I did, normally in 1998 or in 1999, people’s collections are disposed.
Customers selling vinyls to buy CD firsts now sell CDs to get back the plates.
This can explain the increase of people from a certain age that regenerates vinyl.
What is the emotional importance of plaques claimed?
In a store like Phonica, it takes a few seconds to notice that plaque stores offer a cozy community with similar personality.
According to Wez, large customers with some age haven’t particularly power into contactless payment system.
Some vinyl fans may want to go to the stability of the familiar plaque caps from the digital world and reminding the memories of the restful youth.
Wez says, "Sometimes may be to fill a cavity or see material items as a kind of comfort.  "
I think I have this in my own and I think it is in most people.
This is an easy way to fill your head.
A working friend who throws from a plaque stack says "We are like social service officers".
A survey conducted in April revealed that 50% of vinyl album areas have not yet been listening to the album.
At the same time in the survey, 41% had no use of it, and 7 percent of 7 percent of them appeared in vinyl purchase.
In this stage of news, I probably exhibited an extremely worried appearance while studying the nova composition to a number of bosses.
The direction of this return is also a difference by Jonny (42), working in Sounds of Universe (data count: three middle old man).
"At the same time, one came to me, and said: "I don't have a rough player but I want to get a Radiohead plate to put on our shelf."
Although this does not represent a large percentage, it certainly reflects the current situation.
More products, less music.
There are people who say: "I don't have a peek player.  "
These are not old, young people, who are at the end of their tened ages, they are entering this new topic.
Now I see that the audience is quite variable when I arrive at Fopp, which has almost all solids for vinyl.
There are young boys and middle old women who have couples, photographs in their age of 70s.
It is good to see the variety among the customers, although the atmosphere is spreading the pop with sex content instead of calming jazz from the above-mentioned stores (Wild Beast’s last piece).
It doesn’t seem particularly lone but it’s hard to solve psychological traumas that disturb them by stopping them for a long time next to one.
Elanora (27) is a few minutes walk on Fopp and browse the plates at the discount.
Instead of making a paracama just appeared to look at showcases.
He says that it is not the option to make a collection of plaques because it does not gain more.
Very cost.
It’s easier to listen to music from computer or other ways but the beauty of vinyl. .. Like one of the loved ones, it is away from pulling inside.
I don’t know how to explain, it’s really like.
My last stop is a store inspired by new generation vinyl enthusiasts: Urban Outfitters.
I observe a group of young girls collected around Polaroid cameras for a while before a father and daughter's discussion on buying a Crosley plaque player.
There is a stair cavity filled with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac’s plaques; plaques that do not require for an average collection; a mixture of modern and classic.
No one is looking for; perhaps these are only for decoration purpose, some are high enough to be touched.
This is a completely "second vinyl".
But the curiosity for these items may mean that the industry will earn more money and less customers will send the Soho to the depths; there is no more issues that can complain.
It is not surprising that a demographic group with more money and time than most of them spend more money on more luxury items like vinyl.
However, my findings show that the results of YouGov is at least correct in the Soho plaque stores; they do not take into account the female collectors and vinyl enthusiasts in reality, plaque stores or online forums.
These people are probably working hard at school or offices.
These people certainly don’t have to walk around the plaque stores on Berwick Street, examining plaques and escape from the views of a 30-year-old fake television server overlooking the shoulders of the middle-aged men without notice.
Grönland shark, the tallest life-span spine animal living in the world - video news
Science explained that people have the longest remuneration among the vertebrates on the planet.

The French court refused the proposal for the destruction of shops in the forest refugee camp
A court in France refused to offer dozens of decimals in the Jungle Camp where thousands of refugees live in the store and the restaurant did Calais officials.
In the court trial seen in this week, Calais officials defended that people in the camp had sold many products from cigarette to energy drinks, haircuts or 50 cents (40p) in return to tea or a couple of euros, the total of 72 decimals that sell from basic dishes.
The governor of Calais defended that they created a parallel economy without paying taxes and have to be destroyed due to the risk of fire and hygiene.
The helpful groups explained that the shops and restaurants in the court are vital, government-supported organizations and other groups are not enough for the growing population in the camp.
They argue that the shops and restaurants provide shelters and free food for their needs.
A court found in Lille expressed that 72 dewnings are not a legal basis for restricting people from processing the store, but the concerns of the Calais Governor are also "understandable".
Judg Jean-François Molla expressed that people who live in grocery stores, cafes and restaurants are just a big role than feeding.
It expresses that these areas provide comfortable meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
Book Cafe for Non-profit Jungle Kids, one of the places under the risk of deterioration, offers 200 meals every day, gives English and French lessons, and here are advised about hundreds of non-discriminatory refugees in the camp.
Over 170.000 people signed a petition to protect this cafe for children.
In a letter sent to the Guardian, this closure was expressed "somes will be a facia for these children who were eight years old."
The two charity, Help refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, on Friday, the number was estimated that the population in the Jungle Camp appeared on 9,000 (up to the highest number) after growing arrivals in the summer period.
After the golden in Fiji master class, Britain was awarded with silver medal in the rugby seven champion
The impressive progress in the Rugby 7 Championship of the Great Britain ended on Thursday with Fiji, 43-7 defeats in Rio Deodoro Stadium.
Fiji gave the mastery lesson on grip, rust, side step, support, run lines and muscle force to get the first Olympic medal from each color.
After Yenilgi, Britain received the third silver medal of the day as a very non-wicked teselli award, and can now be proud of the efforts they show in the opening tournament of the New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa, which they defeat.
At the beginning of the day, it can be found in the final after the South African Team that they eaten by crushing 7-5 in the semifinals.
But again, a Fiji, which is in this form, could even beat a team of 15 people.
Although not too believed, perhaps the Great Britain can find the protagonist thinking that at least one British will wear gold medal tomorrow: Fiji’s head coach, I Ryan, a British from Wimbledon.
This was a rather demanding trip for Great Britain.
Eight ways ago, when they work with Ryan, they lost every match in the Galatasaray Seven Championship.
This time, they just lost one.
This is really surprised by the progress shown if hezimet is painful.
Fiji made a fascinating start, the players passed over the attempts to get the ball of the Great Britain.
This Captain Tom Mitchell was like to run between a series of moving buses for the team and the World Series champions were 5-0 prefix when Osea Kolinisao moves from the corner.
In the fourth minute, Jerry Tuwai faced another number with falso from the right wings.
The match was 12-0 and the Great Britain had not touched almost more topa.
The great intervention of Mitchell avoided the third of the Leone Nakarawa, such as the mountain, but this was only to delay the number of Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua counted from the right corner and the Great Britain fell back to 17-0.
When the first half bitimine is just a minute, Nakarawa made a number more by coming from the beginning.
Then Vatemo Ravouvou flew to the line for the number, passing through some challenging Great Britain interventions.
With this number, the score between the circuit reached 29-0.
As a team established to play in Fiji 7 championship, the Great Britain was yet trying to learn the basics of the work.
The situation up to such.
Great changes between the UK circuit and the Fiji dam closed; for four minutes, this was a good development according to the first half, Josua Tuisova until it came out with the perfect Fiji game.
Dan Norton was found in a trial for the Great Britain and said to count from the left corner to make the score 36-7, while the game was in possession of the South Sea Islands, singing flag and dancing.
Fiji was really difficult to admire the cheerful approach from the beginning.
Maa Viliame also worships recent additions on Fiji game, which is not necessary to decorate in recent minutes.
When he played, Fijiians began to celebrate and held the way of the dressing room in the United Kingdom hectified way.
At the beginning of the day, Fiji faced Japan in the semifinals of 20-5, the Great Britain also faced with South Africa in a difficult semifinal encounter; the UK was forwarded with a single number.
Kyle Brown, if the first half of the South African team stand out, Dan Norton head swiveled with numbers taken in the second half with foot movements.
Anthony’s brother Marcus Watson, located in the first 15 of England, guaranteed victory and silver medals with great intervention.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning ran victory in the shovel, inspired by the fight of his coaches
These games will not be a more emotional gold medal and this is an important meaning.
From the first move to the last one 220 azap transmitter after breathing Helen Glover and Heather Stanning noticed that they won gold in Estacio da Lagoa could be much more meaningful.
There were three voices on the boat, although there are two people attracting the shovels; women have been reflected in the second gold Olympic medal to the back as the first women who reached this level in England this year.
Truths were quite clear; this was 39th race in the series of unfamiliar, unfamiliar.
If we see two great athletes who are leaked on the surface in the grace of the swan, this image does not reflect the nature of victory.
Behind each shovel gold medal, there is a taboo consisting of willing hands that make this difference and no hand was as effective as those trainers who don’t know how much they can live and live on this day when diagnosed cancer 30 months ago.
As he said, they touched and gone.
I was caught in bladder cancer, which can be interfered with surgery, and they did it.
If they do not do that, they are going to anywhere.
This would be a rather bad situation.
This changes your perspective to life a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triple was very lucky, since it was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, except for the season, it would not be known that there is a correct expression in such cases, but this way it will be able to minimize distractions.
I had to get paid so I had to recover quickly.
This was a encouragement for me.
I was in the hospital and walked up to 6, 9, 15 meters in the garden, although I say that I was enough to take a few steps.
It started.
Sphere is a journey on its own but it grows a bit more.
After victory, he was in Williams, who had spent a nervous morning, talking a bit more than ever to overcome their concerns.
Stanning, which was a hundredthrow in the Royal artillery Union, and previously went to Afghanistan, said, "I was in the case of emotionally shredded this week, perhaps this is a little extreme but the meaning of cidden is very big."
This emphasizes what this means for me, and Helen, once I and how much Robin works.
I spent three years with Helen and Robin.
I would like to convey my greatest thanks to him because it is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t find a better person or a better coach to work.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose race for five years.
Binary is a difficult rhythm that competitors can not reach.
The power of Stanning and Glover, even in the last 500 meters, where the new Zealand and Danish teams closed the rail, was not yet exhausted.
We had covered our own.
Helen 'sureci watch was listening to the process.
It’s really important not to go to the door.
We did a good start and did not work to do something incredible.
Today we didn’t expect the explosion of fireworks, we just wanted to win the race we’ve just pulled out well.
Binary will look for a year before deciding what to do in the future.
Glover has a wedding that needs to attend the next month; his own and television adventurer Steve Backshall's wedding.
Now only wants to enjoy this island.
I didn’t want to say I was my last race.
This would create a lot of prints.
I took six months to notice I was a Olympic champion in London.
It was very new and I was very stressful.
Here, it took about four minutes.
This is a much better feeling."

Snapchat "Anime" Effect Has Be Held As Asian Cartoon
While Snapchat said it is inspired by anime for this filter, some observers express that this is unstable.
Snapchat allows users to play 150 million walls every day with the lens tool with absurt levels by changing the reality of the user.
You can convert yourself to a character that has thrown from a pineapple, dog or a Roy Lichtenstein picture.
Lenses are pervaluable, feature changer tools that make up selfies improved over 30 million every day.
The wrong steps are quickly dig into the memory of the public.
Snapchat lenses had encountered accusations that the app supports black classification or whitened skin tones as beauty ideal.
Therefore, they presented this week, because of the lens that makes users cheek-eyed, damaged gear and inflated, some criticisms have criticized that the company is a "Asian mask" that cartoonizes the Asians.
And they wondered if these duplicate disputes are pointed out to a greater problem regarding the variety of the company.
News and temper spread on Wednesday with the news of The Verge and Motherboard and announced that the Snapchat feature removed after a day.
The company was found in a description: The Mercek was prepared not for the cartoonization of Asians, but for the anime characters.
But for observers with racism experience, this lens reminds life-free stereotypes.
Other people refused anime comparison in general.
Grace Sparapani, who is an American art student of Korean origin and shared with plenty of tweets written about photos, said that in an e-mail it is painful and uncomfortable with the lightest expression.
"With the Asian cartoon, the side-by-side comparison of the effects of the filter added that the discussion is difficult.
This shows that the filter is not only a Asian mask, but also a Asian mask at a downward level.
Snapchat is not the only company exceeding cultural trigger mechanisms.
It is seen that American culture is in an endless conflict of diversity and inclusion in many areas, ranging from meeting rooms to Hollywood and the devices that all carry in their hands.
And the wide young mass, which is more than the other counters of the breed, addressed by Snapchat, can also be interpreted in the form that they can be in a higher precision expectation.
In an interview on Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said, when one of the lenses of Snapchat created a small-lower image for a user, "it is much more difficult to notice such movements as the former."
On Thursday, Mrs Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete Snapchat account and made calls to everyone in this direction.
In the article written for Medium and the interview on the phone expressed that the conflicts associated with the race reflect the shortcomings in the recruitment applications in Snapchat.
Ms Zhu finished its article with a label by eliminating the leading team of white men in the majority of the company: #SnapchatiSilin.
Mrs. Zhu, an American American of Chinese origin, said that different breeds between the staff are not sufficient diversity, they can make such decisions or if there are people who are working there and are different breeds, but these people do not feel safe or comfortable enough to speak themselves.
Other observers also share their opinions on this complaint that Snapchat has not been responded greatly.
The company does not share numbers related to the variety between its staff by highlighting the private company status.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to share the racial origins of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company had to focus on populations that are not represented at sufficient level before short time and to internally increase the work of inclusion.
Ms Zhu, in his respect, stated that the Snapchat account will be closed, and added "I wonder whether it is the need for more users as we can tell if it is not true.  "
The Congress Panel said that the Military Authorities, the ISIS Intelligence
In a report published on Thursday, a congress panel reported that the United States Central Commanda authorities have gathered intelligence reports to draw a more optimistic picture than events in Iraq and Syria.
The Committee of Armed Services of the Palace, an intermediate report prepared by a study arm created by the Supreme Committee of the Intelligence Committee and the Undersecretariat of the Defense Committee, the Central Commanda intelligence analysts, which said the United States forces changed the assessments of the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as Centcom, Tampa is a military headquarters that controls American army operations in Fla. and Central East and Central Asia.
In a news release about the report, the following statements are included: "The intelligence results, which are approved by the leaders of the Kıdemli Centcom, typically draw a more positive picture than the US shows the facts on the field of anti-counterfeiting work, and continuously provide much more positive results than the analysis that the intelligence community created by other elements.  "
The Californian Republican Representative Ken Calvert said "The ones in Centcom are unacceptable; while poor analyses are presented to the top-end decision lentils, our warrior troops are suffering from trouble."
Leadership failures at Centcom have reached the highest levels of the organization.
10 page reports included in the description and analysis of Central Commanda’s work of teaching to Iraqi forces, in 2014 and 2015, also details of permanent problems.
Although the senior Obama administration officials are not certain evidence that they have given orders in the direction of changing reports, but also known as ISIS and DAEŞ, it is explained that they feel pressure from the Centcom leaders in delivering a bettermary perspective on the threat of the analysisers created by the Islamic State.
In the report "In the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, declarations and convention expressions are called "remost positive" from actual events.
For example, a Centcom officer expresses that a large military attack can be made in a early period of April or May 2015, in order to get back to Musul in public.
Musul, the second largest city of Iraq, is now the control of the Islamic State of Islam.
Mike Pompeo, the Republican Representative of Kansas, said, "This issue was quite clearly understood after research that lasts for people."
The most senior intelligence leaders of the Central Command of the United States from the midst of 2014 to the midst of 2015 have manipulated the intelligence results of the commander to be derived from the threat of ISIS in Iraq as trivial.
The Republicans created a work arm after the analysts learned that intelligence about the Islamic State is manipulated.
As the reviews continue, the report published on Thursday will follow much more comprehensive findings.
Another Centcom intelligence review that is carried out by the general inspector of the Ministry of Defense is also available.
The Democrat members of the Saray Intelligence Committee published their findings that participated in some conclusions that the Republican study arm had on Thursday.
Chairman of the Committee Representative Man B. Schiff has created an extremely narrow-minded process in intelligence assessments about Centcom, DAEŞ and Iraq Security Force in a statement between 2014 and 2015.
According to Mr. Schiff, this process has delayed the release of "the results of the course", led to the impairment of the analysts, and "he did not place enough to the opinions.  "
But Mr. Schiff and Democrats expressed that the results of the Centcom analysts of the White House did not reach a finding that they print on "pretently designated or political announcing".
The preliminary results of the congress review were announced on Tuesday by Daily Beast.
In August past, New York Times reported that there is a Pentagon inspector that opened after complaints made by Centcom analysts.
The Upper Jamming Commander Patrick Evans expressed that as a Pentagon spokesperson will not comment on the congress report of the Ministry of Defense in the proceedings of the general inspector in a statement.
However, he said that "in some cases, they may decrease in the dispute regarding the interpretation of complex data, and with the intelligence community, the Ministry of Defense supported the healthy dialogue in relation to these important national security matters.
The research will wake up the echo beyond the problem that the bombing operation in the American precursor in Iraq and Syria does not continue (this is a protagonist revealed by more Defense authorities every day).
However, the accusations made last year have revealed the question of how much the President Obama can trust Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
The criticisms on the reflection of Islamic State intelligence, Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker, President George W. Despite the appeal of many analysts of Bush administration, a small force in Iraq defends and written an article that expresses that he did not think enough after invasion in 2003 and discussed for more than ten years.
Mr Hooker also played an important role in Islamic State intelligence.
The authorities stated that Mr Hooker’s team has built temporary refineries to sell oil in the black-market of air attacks against refineries in the hands of the Islamic State despite the public descriptions in the other direction last year.
However, as The Times mentioned in September, this Bulgu Center did not go out of Commanda.
General Lloyd J. The last year of Austin III, the description of Senato was subjected to criticisms since the war was seen as an extremely positive assessment by many lawmakers.
General Austin was retired in April and replaced by the Central Command General Joseph L. Home
U.S. Women's Grass Hockey Kit Back to Back 4. Wins Victory
Katie Bam, a day after three goals in the win of 6-1 wins received against Japan, on Thursday, the United States women scored the first two goals of the grass hockey team in the encounter that Americans defeated India 3-0.
Although five goals in two matches require a permanent masterpiece in mind, Bam (27) said that the same thing is not to do before.
He said "No idea."
I am not the people who hold the record of their goals.
If it is said: Americans share 4-0 leading in the Olympic tournament and the first row in the group with the UK, which continues to be minted after 2-0 defeats Japan on Thursday.
The UK and the United States will face for the last game of the first round on Saturday.
Both teams have won the quarter final and the match will determine who matches the six teams group and who will finish the second.
The team that finishes group matches first will face a little longer time with the strong Dutch team, which is the leader of another group when the quarter finals start.
But after the match of the Saturday, Americans created sansation by showing a surprising progress here after the last one of the 12 teams of London Olympics.
Bam was in this team.
Blue Bell grew up in Pa.; the grass hockey stick was 3 years old when it was first to eline (which was interested in this sport in Drexel) and was the youngest player of the team by participating in the 16-year-old national team.
Since it was not allowed to enter the last group, 2008 missed its Olympics.
Then he came to the 2012 year in which he did not go towards most things for himself and teammates.
Next year, a British coach Craig Parnham was brought to the task and the work began to change.
Bam says "A complex change, a mental change, a physical change."
Now we are not working as in London.
We have passed completely through conversion.
On Thursday night, Bam received the first number of the first half with a nearby reverse stroke.
India hadn’t yet received a win in the tournament but the team managed to retain the score up to 1-0 until the third quarter of Bam was activated by showing surprising levels of endurance.
He made a long run from the left of the field, and then he went into the ball castle by curling out, and the Americans 2-0 have been prefixed.
Melissa Gonzales scored in the middle of the fourth quarter.
This was the first match that Jackie Briggs, the United States fortresser Jackie Briggs, which allowed him to score in the tournament.
Chances are opened.
Bam.
Parnham said "We are in a good place" but how good this place is the result of the match on Saturday.
Trampoline Dinginity in the Middle of the Olympic Rat
Wherever you are, no matter how many hours, the Olympics continue.
Events in Rio de Janeiro represent a full competition and work, as if it will not end or avoid.
The Olympic torch itself like a flame baton, which is derived from the swimmer, gymnasticsist from there.
Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos do not watch television without having to hear anything about traction, not reading newspapers or talking to what your neighbor is saying in a café.
And there is also Logan Dooley.
Mr. Dooley, who joined the Olympics for the first time, can be one of the names shown in the prime time hours, a gamzeli heartbe, such as a swimmer, gymnasticsist or fencingist.
But Lake Forest is fighting for gold medals in Olimpiyat in Bay Dooley (28) Olympics from California.
The Olympic flame does not light every activity evenly.
The center is far away from the center, in part there are universally recognized sports: air rifle shooter, archery, badminton, monovando.
You will always have a frog with us, for a long time.
However, I would like to pay attention to the secret magic of gizli, if I need to specify personally my favorite.
Although it was known as an Olympic event since 2000, which was introduced in Sydney games, I hadn’t noticed that it was a Olympic sport.
This can be a regional cehalet.
The United States did not win any medals in de even if he sent athletes for the competition and has never been a competitor that has risen to the finals until 2012.
The awards in men were Chinese and Russians tend to share Chinese and Canadians in women.
From China to Dong Dong Dong and Canada Rosie MacLennan this year will work to protect gold medals they have in London.
However, etkinlik attracts attention as an event that doesn’t matter; it may be considered that it is worthy of the school of the clown instead of the Olympics in partially unconscious ears.
I agree that I am not a specialist here, I only have interest in the topic.
There is a funny potential (such as cartoon-like tremor created by the bounce without being terminated) but it also reflects the elegance of gymnastics and diving, which is two sports that combines basically.
The word "Trambolin" comes from the word Spanish hand trampolin, which means "tramplen".
Champion candidates are asked to do a number of movements (burkma, pike and salto) in almost air to a load of 30 feet and before they descend on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated according to the execution, difficulty and "turn time".
16 men from 17 countries in Rio will fight thirty two athletes, 16 women.
The most frequent progress in the Olympics is directly forward.
Those who care to take the medal, up to the end point in some cases in the gold quests, in some cases, back forward, more away with upward movements, faster and more.
They not only follow the finish line or start wall, but also have another challenging line in the television broadcasting; world or Olympic record.
This reduced effort is a noble, imrenile, and even in extreme levels; it is enough to swear a audience even into tears.
However, this is from the features that I find lightly striving while watching the games.
Trampoline allows you to search for them.
Trampoline moves upward.
The goals are not moving forward.
Upwardly looks like atronode, goes up, descend down and re- effortlessly.
Of course, it can not be said that there is no competition or difficulty, but there is no humid study to achieve the conclusion during the routine period, there is no loss from the distance, just like the dream of time and place shooting, it is elegantly suspended.
The more rest if a Olympic race can be listened.
Women’s rankings and then the finals will be held at 13.00 pm on Friday afternoon; men are still on Saturday 13.
NBC will publish the finals every two days from 14.00 in the afternoon block.
In the middle of the Olympic craze, they promise a quiet and wonderful moment that can be ignored in the general arbede.
And if the consciousness is going to increase by offering men's athlete, just as the United States suggest men's gymnastics shortly ago, we can say that Mr Dooley expects new fans.
"A Generation Protestoda" in Ethiopia, which has been in the United States for a long time
Violence Protests in Ethiopia
Political exchanges in Ethiopia met with severe resistance of the government.
Witnesses say that a large number of protesters take fatal weapons blows in the conflict entered by police.
Is Ethiopia crashed?
Over the past decade, Africa was one of the most stable nations and a solid ally for West with fast growing economy.
However, the anti-governmental protests made in the past months were spreading the country to more regions every day.
Only last week, thousands of people asked the basic political change in the street.
According to human rights groups, the government’s response to it was rather brutal.
Witnesses said that police officers struck and killed numerous weaponsless viewers.
In protest images that are thought to be from the past year or early of this year, security authorities are seen, breaking the young people who have to hang their hands against a wall.
The United Nations human rights officer at the highest level wants to have a detailed review.
The Somali Peninsula project director of the International Crisis Group, a research group Rashid Abdi "It was always difficult to keep the country together and it will be much more difficult to advance."
Ethiopia is the highest nation of African population after Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by West.
American army and intelligence services carry close work with Ethiopians to fight terrorist threats in the region, primarily Somalia, and there are very few countries that have helped from Western in Africa.
The economy of Ethiopia is growing impressively.
The infrastructure is effectively improved; even a new suburban train is available in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets are generally silent, safe and clean.
Although the best example of democracy in Ethiopia was not exhibited in Ethiopia (human rights groups are constantly referring to the oppressive attitude of the government) in the country’s opposition was quite limited, the pluralities were effectively succupied.
It was sent to most shoots, it was thrown in the pill, killed or departed to the farest corners of the desert.
But this may be to change.
Seyoum Teshome, a university lecturer from Central Ethiopia, said "People bull and if you do not offer other options from protesting to them, these events are removed."
Youth are completely protested.
In a generation protest.
There are many complaints to prints on power of coalition in power of land use.
After the selection of highly criticism in the past year, the power party and allies received the last chair filled by the opponents and can now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, hundreds of people lost their lives in June, tensions on the border with Eritre, which is pointed and conflicted line.
Analysts are afraid of re-arming in recent years such as Oromo Freedom Facade or Ogaden National Freedom Facade.
For years there are several factors that explain why suffering feelings that are lost under the surface are now burst.
The first looks innocent: smartphones.
As cheap smartphones are widespread and internet services are provided, they started to communicate with a large number of Ethiopian social media only a few years ago.
The government was able to communicate with the internet proxy servers that hides most people’s locations even when they often closed access to Facebook and Twitter as they did in protest times.
Several young Ethiopians said they were collected in this way for protests.
Secondly, the solidarity between Oromolar and Amharalar, the two large ethnic groups of Ethiopia increased.
Oromolar and Amharas are normally not ally.
For a very long time, Amharalar from the mountainous regions of Ethiopia’s dominantly Christian, was exploiting Oromos who were most Muslims in politics and business.
But this situation is changing.
Mulatu Gemechu, a Oromo leader, said, "We are moving to collaborate collected under a umbrella."
The largest protests were seen in Amhara and Oromo regions.
Most Amhara and Oromo think Ethiopia’s population’s approximately 6 percent and is not fair by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which is dominant in military, intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the restlessness was the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, the former riot leader, served as the prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years from a disease that was not disclosed in 2012.
It was thought to be a tactical statement that everyone sees.
Analysts say that it is especially specialized in detecting the first signs of restlessness and depressing competitors and ineffectiveness.
The conflict analyst Mr. Abdi said "The current regime does not have this basic knowledge."
Ethiopia’s new prime minister Hailemariam Desalegn was selected in uncertainty to fill the location of Bay Meles.
Unlike Bay Meles from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr Hailemariam is south.
Analysts say that the security services of Tigrayans are not able to gain the trust.
As a result, more blood poured with fear.
The last experience in this kind of confusion in Ethiopia was protested after the thief of thousands of people’s analysts made by the government from the beginning of the government.
In the measures followed by this, many protesters were killed and this period of confusion was relatively faster.
Development experts praised the leaders of Ethiopia for significant progress in the struggle of vision-owned infrastructure planning and poverty, such as the new suburban train.
However, it’s clear that it doesn’t stop the increase in the Ethiopia government.
And this is dangerous and ethnically.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a town of Amhara, attacked businesses that Tigrayans have, and Tigrayan hats increase in social media.
Analysts say that protests leave other allies in the United States and West in a strange situation.
The American government was using Ethiopia as a base for unmanned aircraft flights on the neighboring Somalia, but it was said that this base was closed shortly ago.
If the West is clearly asked to support democracy, it doesn’t want to disintegrate this ally in an already fragile region.
Mr Abdi said "This" and added "like walking on a very thin rope.  "
Donald Trump Announced Obama’s ISIS in the direction of establishing Obama’s ISIS as “Alayism”
Donald J. Trump, on Friday, insisting a few times a week last week, while the President and Obama Hillary Clinton asserts that the Islamic State of terror group is not serious while claiming that the last conflict around the campaign was eliminated.
This statement gave new questions about the ability to communicate clearly with the American people of the Republican president.
At the same time, in order to defend him in the process of creating this snow, he had a strange position in the process that he tried to explain the statement that he did his best to defend him.
Mr. Trump has been insisting that he was really impeding that he was doing hissis on Thursday after being found in this proposal at a miting on Wednesday.
But on Friday morning at the post on Twitter on early clocks, Mr Trump said that they are only in a musculoskeletal statement.
The post showed that Mr. Trump had a number of interviews that he expressing that he was serious about this accusation.
The conservative radio programmer Hugh Hewitt said Mr Trump tried to help him in softening this review, recalling Mr Trump wanted to destroy Obama ISIS.
Mr Trump revealed the last mess when trying to change the room of the campaign after the drop in surveys.
Mr. Trump and Mrs Clinton made conflicting talks with each other about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr Trump wanted to return to this topic again.
Again speaking on Twitter, Mrs Clinton expressed that offerings will increase taxes and that he was boring to his speech.
Mr. Trump had used the defense of teasing.
After having encountered great criticisms after exhibiting a look suggesting that Russians have been found in the pirate attack on the e-mails of Mrs Clinton, these comments were explained by saying "Of course I said this in a way of teasing."
This approach allows Mr. Trump to force political speech limits and step back in place required.
Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist that monitors the language used by both candidates, said "A layout that allows him to "open" depending on the response, by testing how certain messages react by supporting himself.
However, at the same time, knowing about these declarations and you know it is uncertain enough to filter from different lenses.
After passing the decline in surveys recently, Mr Trump adopted a much more aggressive attitude rather than softening the air for the general selection audience.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey published on Friday showed that Mr Trump’s North Coraline, Virginia and Colorado’s lady Clinton’s bay back and a tight race is available in Florida.
Although Mr. Trump is often guilting for provocative things he said, he is guilting his words or understanding the humor.
But in the last month of the presidential campaign, Mr. Trump’s jokes, although his comments are provocative, but in the case of supporting him in the public, he leaves his loyal supporters difficult.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani made his best to defend the candidate in his interview with CNN on Thursday as one of the most prominent supporters of Mr Trump.
When Mr. Trump asked about the accuracy of thesis in which Mr. Obama and Mrs Clinton establishes the Islamic State, Mr. Giuliani said "Bence is doing a legitimate, political criticism."
From one point, before Obama, ISIS was an unknown, small organization, they were completely faulty and this was due to the withdrawal of soldiers from Iraq.
Most prominent Republicaners try to defend that Mrs Clinton fails to cope aggressively with the situation in the Middle East of Obama administration, the ministry of foreign Affairs, and caused the growth of ISIS.
Before the mitings to be held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continues to blame the news media through Twitter to distort each word and act against him.
He said "heavy, bitterness" television experts who are trying to solve himself, "They can not do it!".
Some Democrats said Mr. Trump is evidence that it is not suitable for any other person by stinginging out with the bahane that he took forward.
Renewed in the cafe Greenpoint, which cannot be started with Prices
Verb Cafe Wi-Fi, a former tassel place that works only with cash in Williamsburg, was offering wonderful coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, I couldn’t start at prices at the shop at Bedford Avenue.
In the summer of 2014, Verb's store sells soaps in the form of Soap Cherie cap cake.
Regional residents were close by expressing that this was the last loss of the city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter. "New York is change, I know it, but I still can not believe that CBGB goes and Chelsea Hotel is discharged and Verb is now a soap store.  "
But the city of reinventing until New York has changed.
In the Greenpoint last November, a Verb Cafe opened in the north, less than a mile from the original position.
New Verb Cafe has Wi-Fi connection and accepts credit card but some old employees and similar simple weather.
Coffee is good.
At the beginning of the new Verb, the former cafe has Cisco Rodriguez, the owner of the new place and the general manager.
Its own was folded in Verb in 2001 and up to the end.
A customer said he would be excited to do so when he offered financing to him for this new place.
Bay Rodriguez (36), most things left the same.
Verb uses the same distributor for simites and bought an espresso machine from the same model.
Even the old Verb’s lights were reused here.
But Mr Rodriguez said he wanted to offer a little different experiences.
New materials added.
Rust-resistant-and-peynirli sandwiches are available in the menu and materials such as capari and soteed onions are offered.
There are brunette-rice bowls.
The cafe is no longer serving beer but offers fresh juices.
After nine months, Mr Rodriguez said that the former individuals began to come in a stable way.
He said "Many old customers could not cope with at the prices in Williamsburg."
On the past Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Ms Oliveira (34) She lives in Williamsburg and was going to Verb often.
Even after moving to Greenpoint, it did not give up progress on this road.
After closing the Verb, he said he called to drink coffee for a while.
"I noticed that what I'm looking for is coffee and culture in Verb."
Now again began to drink coffee, but the last day chose a new add-on mixture, instead of the usual frosty coffee.
Tom Rosenthal, another modest, went to Verb regularly since 2003.
It goes there before here and always gave the same order.
"Every day, I entered the seven in quarter, without any wonder, and they prepared my order of tere oily simit every day."
Photo Mr Rodriguez said he wanted to make changes and add new materials to the menu.
Today, Mr. Rosenthal is always taking the usual order, but sometimes it makes a little change by adding rust, eggs and cheese to the simit order of every day.
Mr Rodriguez said that the old space is not narrow to the soap store.
If you look at the same, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for Verb using the cold brewed coffee of the cafe.
Mr Rodriguez said "We can still accept this offer."
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint also adopted this cafe.
One of the new customers translated the menu to Polish and Mr Rodriguez said that new neighbors will find a space that will display this menu recently to feel good.
There are other advantages of new location.
Local juice store wants to bottle and sell cold brewed coffee.
There is the possibility of expanding the cafe to the adjacent building.
Even if a new Verb is available for most customers.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and after the space is closed, it was very uncensored.
When the new venue is opened, Mr. Whitt said that it feels in the house where it feels coffee.
"I'm supposed to smell."
In the "A Square Meal" book of the Crisis Time to Depressif Yiy
In March 1933, immediately after sitting at the Presidential chair, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in lunch at the Oval Office.
President Roosevelt, one of the most fond of the Bosphorus, loves the foods of the Fifth Avenue, which is decorated as a kerosene soup and adornment soup of Maryland.
The menu of the day was much more modest: tomato sauce boiled eggs, potatoes porridge and sweetly dry creamy pudding.
Jane Ziegelman said "This was an action to establish solidarity with people suffering from trouble."
The wife Andrew Coe added: "This was also a message given to Americans about how to eat.  "
Couple living in Brooklyn Heights, dinner dateer.
The last book "Chop Suey" was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Ms Ziegelman was also telling the lives of the night in the Lower East Region in the book called "97 Orchard".
"A Square Meal", which is the new book they work together and will be published by Harper on Tuesday, tells the history of American cuisine during the Great Buhran era.
They met with a correspondent for dinner in the Eisenberg Sandwich Buffet which has been located in the Flatiron region since 1929, which has been the year that the attack started by showing solidarity in food.
Lady Ziegelman (50) preferred to sit in cheese and olive sandwich, Bay Coe (57), turkey, potato porridge and vegetable.
The double found that the correspondent's roll meatballs order is suitable for the controversial of the crisis period.
Lady Ziegelman said "Theirs were very popular."
Ground nuts, ciğer nuts, dry beans nuts.
They were made of a cheap thing that emits material with a material.
Imagine what you eat until you are enough in dinner.
Mr. Coe, sourd her face.
"You should have to sit on the stomach of the man, like the bride."
In the previous years of crisis, especially in rural areas like a buffet of tables in America.
Women cook food for men working in the farm and served freshly baked tours in breakfast, lunch and dinner.
1. In the World War, Americans were sent to Europeans who died from hunger. "A Square Meal" explains the history of methods of dealing with the emergence of plenty of centralness at once of the nation.
Mr. Coe explains the reason for writing on this topic of himself and his wife, "This was a period where the dish became a central, alarming point for Americans."
The new budget regime was also equally alarming: mysterious foods such as nuts and moths have become the basic consumption product, according to Lady Ziegelman said, "it was a great way to evaluate the remaining food" in this way, the cookers could hide the appetite-closed materials at the bottom with a creamy sauce coating.
Fresh fruits took dried fruits, which are cheaper to replace.
The meat in the center of American dishes for years has become a luxurious, which has been considered to be an attitude.
Interesting blends for calorie and nutritional value have been drilled, and the feel of the dodium passed into the sense of taste or general kitchen.
Women Ziegelman, while researching for the book that includes recipes, he prepared onion dinner in the plumbing oven belonging to the period.
Mr. Coe said "This dinner was not a loved additive in the table."
Ms Ziegelman supported it: "This was true.  "
No common point with onion in the oven of pecan paste.
This was an outstanding feature in most home economy recipes.
Home economy experts, who are located in Louise Stanley, who are responsible for the Federal Home Economy Bureau, referred to the country’s eating habits as never before.
Recipes and articles promoted women to be "tasarruflu" by publishing in newspapers and magazines, and they were widespread to transform slurry into tasty foods such as carrot creamy spaghetti.
"A Square Meal" is a banquet consisting of historically delicious bites.
President Herbert Hoover’s leave the bakeman’s answer to the open citizens of the government such as the patriarchy.
On the one hand, the simple Iowa farmer's dishes in the public's childhood paid, and on the other hand, he eats dishes like million intellectuals.
Mr. Coe said "I like to eat European cuisine flavors such as vegetable sauce."
Wearing jackets suitable for dinners in the evening, almost completely eats in a golden-plated dining room.
It was extremely far from facts.
If the spouse Eleanor does not encourage him to be an example with his stomach, President Roosevelt also could drop the same error.
According to the book’s telling, Ms Roosevelt’s flavor has been offering a help that doesn’t care about it, not only in the White House, but also the most prepared plates in the musculoskeletal way.
After the country has appeared on the refoot, most of the methods of eating in the crisis period were left to aside.
According to Lady Ziegelman, the shape of calorie and nutrition-oriented understanding and science to cook.
Couple expressed that the mother of Lady Ziegelman learned a lot from eating habits, for example, the dish was never thrown into trash.
Mr. Coe said "I'm going to fear him really."
Ms Ziegelman spoke about his old memories: "It was actually sick people.  "
There was a case of contraindications.
After collecting plates in Eisenberg, he himself and Mr. Coe took a dessert that they prepared at home: dry sweet sweet, which was eaten in the lunch of President Roosevelt.
Ms Ziegelman said "This is called a tampered dry plum" and added the most often referenced number, it was to give a cool name to the modest recipes.
There was no whipped cream; just dry plum, slightly flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was immersed in brown sticky budding in a hesitic way.
Surprisingly not too bad.
Mr Coe received the second and third spoon.
"The part of the chopped walnut would be good" said to his wife as one can be saved.

Clinton family won $10,75 million dollars in 2015 and paid federal tax by 34.2 percent
Hillary Clinton announced the tax statement of 2015, showing that Democrats have earned $10,75 million dollars in the past year and paid federal tax at 34,2 percent in force.
In 2015, Clinton’s family contributed to 1 million dollars to charity, most Clinton Foundation, the former president’s Bill Clinton won about 5,3 million dollars from conversation fees, and the former minister of foreign Affairs declared that Simon & Schuster has reached 3 million dollars for the book that came from the publishing house in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton’s candidate friend US Senator, Tim Kaine from Virginia published 10 years tax statement with his wife Anne Holton.
In 2015, they paid federal tax at 20,3 percent.
The Clinton campaign said "Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continues to determine the standard for financial transparency in a declaration of Jennifer Palmieri".
Unlike this, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses about what they promise to explain the tax statements he did before and throws back.
Although it does not require laws, it is a tradition that the U.S. presidents provide tax statements publicly.
Trump and lawyers, a businessman with New York, expressed that the rejection of the publication of declarations is a audit conducted by the Revenues Administration.
In connection with the declarations of the Democratic candidate, the Clinton campaign officer took the Ian Sams "Sıra youde" tweet.
On Thursday, Trump’s special case and Michael Cohen said that until CNN audits were completed, Trump would not allow them to publish.
In 2012, the group that criticizes Trump, including Mitt Romney and other Republicans, the president of the Republicans, expressed that this refusal status itself constitutes question marks on many other connections, including their contribution, business agreements and those with Russia.
Clinton went on this situation by publishing an online video that shows that top-end Republicers print on Trump’s taxes.
On Thursday, he expressed this problem in a economy conversation made in Michigan.
He said, "To do every candidate for years, he refuses to publish tax statements."
Politico reported that Trump paid almost no tax for two years in 1990s, and on Friday, the New York Times business division shared statements that a number of tax attorneys and accountants may still continue this way.
Federal tax rates have become an important problem in the choice of presuming.
Clinton offered a rule proposal, which will provide at least 30 percent of those who gain over $1 million per year, billionaire investor Warren Buffet.
President Obama also supports this offer.
Last week, Nebraska challenged in a Clinton miting in Omaha, Berkshire Hathaway group that operates there in Buffett, Trump and presenting tax statement.
Buffet expresses himself from the IRS audit, and not from Trump’s tax collection institution, but from the voters to "hear".
Clinton published tax statements from 2007 in its campaign.
Currently New York, the family of Clinton, who live in Chappaqua, died approximately 32 percent of the average federal tax between 2007 and 2014, and the combined tax rate reaches about 40,5 percent.
The declaration of Clinton family for 2015 shows that most Americans come from only 100 dollars of their income.
The main investments are a low-cost index investment fund and the Clinton family declares that their dividends and interest revenues are $109,000 dollars.

Powder red pepper condoms, chestnut plugs support the protection of elephants in Tanzania
The environmentalists in Tanzania use an unusual method to prevent the elephant from entering human habitats; they throw them dust red pepper filled condoms.
The method was proven to be effective, and this idea was stepped to introduce the US-based Nature Protection Association with thislan Honeyguide Foundation for several years ago; in villages in northern Tanzania, volunteering began to train their homes and crops to use the method of protection without damaging animals.
Previously most people were using spear to defend themselves.
On Friday, the World Elephant Day, dedicated to the protection of animals.
Honeyguide’s administrative director Damian Bell has seen that it changed the attitude in the communities since we have developed the "Tool set" in a statement; no longer even more self-esteem owners about the fact that they can keep away from the land without damaging the elephants."
The first two steps include to keep the chips passing and play the horn.
What is called "red pepper cloud" when it is not possible.
Powder red pepper mixed with soil is put into condom with a chestnut plug, only the tip is turned off, so that it will remain open to the fün.
When burned, condom opens with an explosion voice and red pepper is scattered in the air.
Even a breath is enough to send the elephant in the opposite direction.
The last remedy is to use a mancunuk, which leads to a high voice, bright explosion, from the air to the fire.

The filmmaker reported the status of the hotel to get a description.
Lanzmann wrote "he shocked" the answer he received.
The secretary of the hotel expressed that this measure was received by "A deliberate decision of the management of Kempinski-Hotels".

Adana Republic Chief Terrorism Terror-Technical and Organized Crimes Investigation Firm, the resignation of the people and organizations associated with FETÖ/PDY, provided that the value with the change made in zoning plans to increase in the amount of fahiş, prepared for financing to the terrorist organization of FETÖ/PDY, 17 suspects about Adana 2. The case was opened to the Supreme Court.
In the case that Fetullah Gülen, who had 1 sanctuary, was judged by the crime of the ‘Anatosal Layout from the Middle to Lifting, court delegation, the sanctuaries with Gülen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu, decided to capture for arrest.
But until this time, the court decided to carry out illegal operations for 4 sanctions, which did not be caught and did not come to hearing.
Adana 2. The Heavy Penalty Court was located in the foreign country to ensure that the case on the rights remains unforeseen, and therefore it was not able to reach him, Fetullah Gulen, Ömer Ekinci, Kemal Elibal and Cemal Soncu's "Ceza Declarations Law (CMK) decided to be handed to all goods assets, "as per Article 278/1".
With this decision of the court, firari sanils do not move in Turkey, black-sea and air transportation vehicles, all kinds of rights and receivables, precious paperwork, company shares with its partner, rental cases and bank accounts were frozen.
Hüseyin Gülerce: The destruction of Gülen depends on the collapse of 3 legs
Hüseyin Gülerce, who commented on the impact attempt of FETÖ, found in stunning explanations.
The line heads from Hüseyin Gülerce’s descriptions are as follows:
I wrote this topic in my last 5-6 months as I went from my mind that they will take off to the pulse, "can they say, but they can not do in the command chain."
I didn’t even know two things; the first is common and deep in this diameter, for example, Jandarma General Commander’s 8 year orders subayi and the president of Mr. President.
Mr. President’s most struggling person, who has taken care of how he/she did not think about his/hers but the most important feature of them is unprecedented privacy.
Two faces.
One of the most important evidence of the expression "This is not the work that a retirement can do" such as FETÖ is that it is a deep sandblast.
CIA is definitely supported.
CIA was very early.
Mahmut Övür says in 2014, in 1971, Vehbi Koç’s house, Fuat East and Fetullah Gülen was discussed.
It says that the most interested people of the period are close to the relationship between MİT and CIA.
The salary of our armed forces staff is the U.S. edema, after remembering them, one man came out as follows.
When we learn this, in 2014.
After this article of Mahmut Bey, there was no explanation that lies.
For example Is Fair Uncensored, not caught in the row?
Who is wondering.
The man went to Pensilvanya for 2 times a day before the blow, 2 days ago.
We have gone abroad for 109 times since 2002.
When you bring them together, you need to investigate this; all of the escapes are going to the United States of Fetullah Gülen, from March 1999, which went to the US with a bahane, they need to investigate this.
It will be seen that they have gone to Pensilvanya on the occasion.
But the main contacts with CIA can be detected from the moment; especially from people who need to be raised through the safety, it was very human sent to the US.
There is a Wikileaks document; it builds up a Gülen association and makes joint meetings with this association CIA.
From 15 years before CIA to show those links to the picture.
I said Fuat Avni is a intelligence pool in Pensilvanya 2 years ago.
The man working at Prime Minister is working to Fuat Avni.
But the bad thing is that this information dropped to CIA as it fell to Pensilvanya.
Roseen's destruction is connected to the three-foot crash; one of us say the base, which created the friendly ring, there are those in the deep hypnosis well, even those in this pulse attempt say that Erdoğan was still the film.
Three foot I was saying, support a base.
The stolen of the questions, theft, defeating the right of the ear, wrapped the support of this base.
Other two foot; political support, international support.
International support is still available.
The only thing to break the political support is documented by the FETÖ of MHP managers with Baykal.
After July 15, "FETÖ" Mr. Kılıçdaroğlu also uses the eye of everyone.
"I'm going around."
I said in my side, "ahhu Hüseyin Bey, they see many different dreams, they are sending me, because I was no longer banned, because it is not true to get rid of dreams."
A voice record has fallen, the person who spoke in his voice record Barbaros Kocakurt: Hocam friends dreamed, double our messenger tweets.

The impulses did not cut off TV broadcasts
15 Special televisions with significant share in the prevention of pulse initiative on July, continued broadcasting thanks to a technical staff that resists protagonists in Turksat.
Here is the hero Asm Akkaya...
After reading on TRT, Akkaya said that they enter resistance psychology with the instruction to cut the post, "I took care of everything thinking that my friends are martyring in fire that opens from the Helikopter.  "
They asked me to cut guns and publishes.
I just closed local TVs.
Then I gave away from the building by saying that we should go to the antennas.
I spent up to 20 minutes in the area of the antennas.
"I cut some cables again here but I did not touch the posts."
In order not to succeed the publication in the pulsers Türksat, Hayyolu TV’s experts brought.
These terrorists were caught by police from 3 minutes before the incident.
When they return to the building, approximately 1 hour later, he understood that the TV broadcasts from the phone came to them, and he explained that he came to the nose with death, Akkaya said they live:
I took it at 8 pm on the evening.
Ora was entrusted to us.
E-State and a friend for electrical system was seizures.
We passed helicopters from our top by making low flight in the esnada we met to drink tea like 21.00.
There were more than a few airlines flying quietly around the helicopter.
We have seen the lights.
Probably the image was unmanned air tools.
They fly from front of the Helipkopters.
For the first time, I was looking for nizamiye, since I had a close flight.
Then a movement started.
When looking at the news, we learned that the bridge is closed.
Our headquarters in O esnada gave instructions for those who come to the building for those who haven’t metsaide in the security.
To get information, we learned that the packages of all broadcasts in TRT are dropped.
For 5 minutes, TRT broadcasts were cut.
I was looking for the main control of TRT but I couldn’t access it.
Our control station said that TRT broadcasts come back and the statement starts reading.
Our Deputy General Manager Halil Yeşilçimen wanted to urgently cut TRT broadcasts with the instruction of the general manager.
We started to work to cut out the publication as it broadcasts a wide broadcast from TRT 3 channels.
I heard that the Prime Minister Binali Yıldırım said ‘have a concession’.
Our manager’s ‘clear’ order put us a bit of resistance psychology.
We cut TRT, after a while we heard the helicopter voice.
We went out, nizamiyeye in the helicopter fired everywhere, everyone was scattered since.
We stored on the back to a building.
Total 12 people.
We went to the back, the soldiers descended from the helicopter.
A few friends caught soldiers.
We also appeared to not leave them alone.
I saw that they were able to help the general director of the esnada and the knee collapsers.
The soldiers were talking among themselves.
 ' Let's hit one of them, one that says they are afraid.
Then we all sit in.
The Commanders ‘Who’s the controller, I’m not going to ask for a more.
 ' Let’s hit one’s style talks as well as we thought: We don’t have news from memleket but a instruction came to us, ‘just’.
I have a resistance.
I felt I gave myself my own life.
 ' I said.
I got up without knowing what to do at that moment.
It was the only thing I thought that I was fired from the helicopter to my friends.
I thought it was a martyr of 10-15 friends in Nizamiye, and ‘we will kill at the end of us’, a comfort crashed.
You will cut all the posts except ‘TRT’ in their heads.
We have a system section that we monitor while satelliteing local channels.
80 of the 200 local channels are broadcast from the room.
This room has arrived.
There were no national broadcasts in them.
I tell you that these are cutersem and all have been cut, at least until that time or the support comes from the outside.
Or I said I went to the ground.
We agreed that we cannot exit there in Netice.
 ' I'm going to cut it ok.
I cut the antenna output of one of the local channel packages.
I cut the power button to monitors we can track the national channels.
Thus, there was no signal on all screens.
I said I shouldn’t go to antennas to completely cut off.
Commander led me to the antenna with two soldiers.
I opened the antenna room, one of the military said 'stop in the forest'.
Take the gun.
You will cut all except 'TRT, no one will, I will hit one at the end of your inner, that you're going to be.
I’m not saying anything else, I’m going to be frozen all that you’ll see you’re going to be ‘think’ because I’ve ever passed away from my life.
I entered the station, cut the local posts by oyaping.
We went to other antenna.
At that time there is a system that corresponds to the national channel near 20.
Around 20 monitors wereted indefinitely.
My Lord helped us so much, and they had not been forced to answer them, and they connected them.
We believe in the answers we provide.
They did not.
This relieved us.
They asked the substation after exiting the antenna.
 ' I don’t know TV broadcaster’ I said, ‘Do I have electricity in your mind.”
 ' I said the team income if there is no electricity after the evening.
In fact, there were electricityers at that time.
I thought I didn’t cut Cyprus posts.
I thought to cut them too to oath the soldiers.
They relieved a little because they thought they were cut off.
They couldn’t mind looking for posts.
Now the group went to wait.
After about an hour, they have seen A News broadcasting in the waiting hall.
Includes soldiers.
 ' My Commander A News was not cutting the publication.
We came to look at the commander.
 ' She said to get up to the Moon.
Calm.
At that time a soldier said ‘there are ongoing posts’.
'There are channels broadcasting in Cyprus'.
 ' I said they are broadcasting through Cyprus, I can’t do anything to them.
"After writing with one of them, we all walked up to stand up."
Impulses escaped from Türksat by minibus.
I saw me from photos that the soldier who took me to the toilet and the watering was in the seat of the van.
3 times they shot from the forehead and the cheeks.
My friends also tried to be the same soldier.
In our side, he called 'evlat'.
Probably a soldier.
They can be infused to get rid of it.
According to the statements of Asm Akkaya, the first police team came from Gölbaşı.
Police teams are helicopters in the environment, they went to get ammunition that turns to the county to find out that the vulnerabilities are scanned.
They returned after 40 minutes.
When police teams arrive, there was no one at the outside of Turksat.
After 3-4 minutes from the police, Akkaya said that the so-called experts sent from Hayyolu TV came to the building, "They called us from the Polis teams, we are Turkishsat staff, we need to enter urgently."  "
"Polys ID has been wrapped in multiple phones with the problem, and they gave them the news "we'd" in.

Az-trained, former footballer Erdoğan
If it disrupts this balance, the less trained old footballer was the winner of the high-trained followers, who had a large degree of religious entrepreneurs with the populist beneficiaries that Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s leadership.
The above is the translation of the sentence in an article last week in Foreign Policy.
Erdoğan’s little trained and old footballer who graduated from university; Gülen’s first-school graduates is characterized as a large entrepreneur of horizons, which clearly praised the Gülen disciples and similar articles are often found in the Western press.
After that, on the other hand, "Why it rises to America and/or Western contrast in Turkey?" in themed articles, they are trying to explain with the phrases starting at the 'because Erdoğan...'.
It is possible to think that the Western contrast in Turkey is bihaber from Turkey, the analysts, which are seen as a state of nevzuhur, which appeared in the period of Erdoğan.
In fact, if the statistics are looked at, the first decade of the Erdoğan era can be read as a period that the Western contrast in Turkey decreases or remained in the meantime.
In this decade, it was in synchronised with the European Union and the United States.
Erdoğan’s ‘one-minute has criticized Israel, insisting that there is a clear policy of the EU to reveal the inner battle, as a result of the catamarans of the Assad regime in Syria, and in the refugee crisis, Turkey’s only leave, the European Parliament President Schulz is left with the "Erdoğan isn't the need to fight in Syria," and the U.S. Mayor of London, which now can not imagine within the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the citizens of the Turkish Republic of Syria, and the nationals of Turkey, such as the PKE.
Let’s have no support to our democracy until we lose our 247 people, our so-called ally, the EU countries and the failure of the blow from the US, and the first speech of Kerry expects to build peace and stability in Turkey, we forget to make no emphasis on democracy and selected government.
So, since the 11 Charlie Hebdo employee in Paris was killed, how many leaders from the world involved in protesting walks but resisting tanks for democracy are over a month from the impact attempt to kill 247 people, although there is no longer coming from any Western country with ‘perfect’ in Turkey?
What will we say to send sub-level representatives of the heads or senior representatives from several times a year for the issue of refugees?
How will we see that all EU and U.S. ambassadors have gone to visit the past, bombed Turkey will not have a solidarity visit to the Great Assembly?
In the first two weeks when the impact in Egypt is remembered that the EU’s top-end representative leads to the impact leader Sisi, criticized by saying ‘democracy rebuilding’ in the pulse after the Kerry’ visit, if it remembers that the Western countries that imitate to be supported in democracy resistance to Turkey aren’t intimate in Turkey?
Gülen, who saw 95% of the people of the people, as a supervisory, has been able to live freely in the U.S., at this time, the Turkish people are willing to undo it.
If the background I mentioned above is also added to it, I guess it is clear that the rising West/American contrast is not only explained by Erdoğan.
Moreover Erdoğan is not even said that the US impact in the blows...
Say that the case never had a confirmation
If you say, "Sandık teferruat", who did not think about himself, "Ignorance of the snow," the Gezi intelligenceers who are down as "the same wire after 15 July nights?
I wondered after seeing how this public has a state and democracy?
But the questions you need to find are so much?
To be Hain, Subays, who served in various stages until yesterday, and have given them the right to use weapons of the state, at a time, have been accepted to enter the status of "Hain" and asked asylum from foreign states.
We must see how we live in a mental palpitability environment and how people who are looking forward to behaviors to be attributed as permutability.
Sued brains When it comes to pulse attempt...
For those who participated in this action, Is Turkey’s cities have a view over Syria’s cities?
Is a subay bombs to the parliament of its country?
We were not falling in each other, such as waiting for proper behaviors, from artificial brains with bedbugs of FETÖ.
Other responsibilities But let’s say that everything is not only FETÖ.
The people who offer politics as a fight, kin and hate profession have made the necessary contributions to life-related tragedys.
While they do not want to offer themselves as "Aydin", they believe that all kinds of unusual behavior and even unemployed are natural.
At the end of seeing how to fire this ring, as the gun is dataed from the hands of those who hate from their own people.
The way of Democracy, the way we know
I’m saying something very simple: 15 July evening in Turkey, FETÖ’cü tufeyliler, haramilara, sergerdelara 250 martyrs, and it’s very much to save democracy.
But behind July 15 1992-2002; 2002-2012; 2012 and after three periods.
There are three changes prepared in three periods: economic, social, political.
Social exchange prepared two major cases: from rural area to metropole migration and transportation to the center after this migration is kept around cities for a long time.
I mentioned that this move on Wednesday is through the metro.
I also stressed that Metro is the most important social change element.
The second big change in the same direction is bridges and roads.
The contribution to modernization of the road and bridge is easier understood.
Road income, economic and social structure changes.
We have changed so much political structure.
I found this date with the bridges thrown on the Bosphorus in Istanbul, since it was.
Demirel built the Bosphorus Bridge.
This was born in the 1960s of peasant movement after 1950.
Özal continued its progress in the same direction with the second bridge we have changed its name as 15 July Martyrs Bridge.
Even the way routes of these show the relationship between the environment-center.
It is the sign of how a social change route is monitored.
The maximum masses of Demirel and Özal were melted in the center.
The ideology of the center was to adopt them.
The EC Party did not do the third bridge for many years.
Because the migration was driven by the whole speed.
Incoming people were placed in satellite cities.
A little closed system was created in O regions.
Local governments with the EC Party exceeded people, business, social status, they voted to the EC Party.
Thus, the mass was not melted in the center, but they were asked to get cyanic consciousness in the environment and come to the center as ‘self’.
This formation was relevant to the discussions of the ongoing headphone prior to the EC Party (1992-2002).
These discussions were conservative, self-esteem, and the need for people with the center of the rock were accepted to the masses, not side-by-side.
The EC Party moved through the method I mentioned after 2002, the masses became political, folded into politics, matured.
After these, pay attention now, 3. The democratic struggle in July 15 with the construction of the bridge is simultaneous.
Say, history and sociology overlapped.
I add a size more: The AK Party’s move I’m talking about is not limited to Istanbul bridges.
It’s something more interesting: AK Party now integrates environmental cities with central cities.
This is provided via two bridges.
A, Osmangazi Bridge.
Two, Çanakkale 1915 bridge.
Add ways to it.
Turkey will now reach İzmir from Thrace.
Do you know what it meant, Izmir will now be a different city after that.
Let’s say, İzmir, where the EC Party can’t get ‘inner’ will now take ‘out’.
Now Bursa, now Çanakkale, will now turn to another cradle and social geography of Thrace cities.
So!
15 July martyrs are stars of this great adventure.

Why was Saint Lightning installed?
The head of the club, which is the most part of Turkey, is with the thought that it can harm him if this mind is.
"The case was used to draft Saint Yıldırım."
After these words, a description came from Faik Light, which is the important lawyers of the Chike Case.
The opposite view program published in the Light Newstürk was released and announced the person who complained of Aziz Yıldırım to Fethullah Gülen, who was addressed.
Here are the words of Faik Light:
Saint Yıldırım says something to Ihsan Kolavan about Fethullah Gülen.
When coming from Azerbaijan, in private plane.
Saint bey is a humorous man, he also tells one with western sentences when criticizing.
The western sentences are perhaps a bit wing.
Some of the phrases may react.
These sentences are grown somewhere.
Towels, auspices, as if such a businessman goes to Hac, Umre, it’s not the job to be accepted with such tolerance.
They say what work, very heavy.
The only problem of course is not.
In the meantime, a football team tries.
Some footballers and managers directly from Galatasaray Club and Hakan Şükr...

Very striking statements about Robert Amsterdam!
Robert Amsterdam, the author of Amsterdam&Partners law firm, who asked the international illegal activities of the Fetullahçı Terrorist Organization (FETÖ), shared information on how to organize FETÖ, taking a article in the US magazine Forbes.
Located close to how the FETÖ elevation Fetullah Gülen manages the organization from the finance in Pensilvania, Amsterdam expressed how Gülen’s school “about 150 contracted (charter) in the US, which will be seen as a secretly advanced organisational ability under the organization.”
Amsterdam stressed that seven months ago by Turkey, Gülen connected companies and schools were assigned to research, as far as they found, "shocking".
Amsterdam included the following opinions in the article:
According to the information given to us, Gülen has a strict hierarchy where the instructions for the organization are transmitted.
These instructions are usually sent in meetings with Gülen and Poconos to face.
There are a number of management groups (see group) consisting of seven people on the hill.
These group instructions are transferred to the consultation committee.
The instructions are here, respectively, going to the region imams, country privileges, region imams in the country, province privileges, region imams in provinces, neighborhood privileges, student houses (light homes) and students.
Businessmen, bureaucrats and officers work at different levels according to their positions and support within the organization.
Amsterdam said that the organization opened 55 thousand jobs across the world, has the largest contracted school network in the US, reported that millions of dollars are given to these schools every year from taxes paid by American taxpayers.
Amsterdam wrote that the large part of these coins is directed between the members of the organization and transferred to "selected" subcontractors.
Amsterdam announced this functioning with the following examples:
Magnolia schools in California have been caught while making 700 thousand dollars for annual service contract, which is linked to Gülen and share the same office.
Amsterdam showed Dove Science Academy in Oklahoma as another example.
Amsterdam noted that this school pays more than 3,1 million dollars to the owner of the property, as well as the management of the school and property company in audits were detected from the same persons connected with Gülen.
In the 46 branch Harmony schools that hold the largest place in the Gülen network, Amsterdam noted that the FETÖ connected smaller companies paid money with pens such as software license, curriculum purchase.
Amsterdam, by drawing the gold that is rich in each other in FETÖ, "The examples I give show that American taxpayers are abused about 28 million dollars.  "
"The more visible part of what we have found so far," said.
To date, that pointed out that nothing was done for the blocking of such events, Amsterdam reminded that the situation goes worse in the past time zone, on all this, Teksas Training Office began to research irregularities.
Amsterdam stressed that schools are normal in appearance, there are no information on what kind of corruptions of many employees.
Amsterdam, "However, in fact, these schools work like snow machine for Gülen.  "
"Gülen then used for political donations in order to hide massive amounts of money, illegal activities," he made his evaluation.
According to the expression that a former American teacher worked in these schools, Amsterdam said that some of the employees in Gülen schools are separate meetings, a certain part of their salary is transferred to the organization, "I am trying to work similar to Gülen members in Turkish Armed Forces.  "
Impact provocatives strengthened their positions in years.
"However, when the army works normally, a parallel power behind the scene was confiscated. He wrote.
Amsterdam finished its article as follows:
15-16 in the head of policy makers in the US There are questions signs of interest with events in July and later, and this is something expected.
However, when taking two allies in a diplomatic level, it is necessary to wake up individual government authorities in the operations of Gülen in a series of US laws.

Attention to this habit of children
Professor Dr. Bilgin Giray, Professor of Dentistry, said that children are comfortable with this reflex by making them a need of absorption as they can not chew in the first ages.
Assoc. Dr. Giray, who ranks the reasons for the appearance of the habit of finger absorption in children. Dr. Giray is an event seen from birth to 3-4 years.  "
Most babies absorb thumbs.
In order to satisfy the need for suction in the baby, the child absorbing his finger for 11.5 years later absorbs the finger to remove and relax the mother.
"When it comes to bored and self-heavy, the sleep comes from, when it comes to tedirgin and left from the mother, it can be found in the behavior of finger absorption."
Assoc. Dr. Bilgin Giray, who emphasizes that the sense of poorness and trust in the mother-child relationship on the basis of the finger absorption behavior seen in advanced ages has not been sufficiently developed. Dr. Bilgin Giray told these behavior with the following words:
Finger absorption behavior shows a negative effect in the shaping of the child's tooth structure.
As a result of the pressures revealed during the suction, the upper teeth are pushed forward, the teeth at the bottom are also pushed back.
This leads to positioning behind the lower jaw, disrupts the stability of the palate and tooth structure.
The physiological reflection of this happens in the form of aesthetically bad appearance of speech disorder and closing.
If there is no early solution, it is an associate professor who considers the fact that during 6-7 years of age, a much more complex treatment process can live. Home Giray can protect our children from closing and joint problems without completing jaw development.  "
"Therefore, today, children have completed their words by saying that the oral structure is also under control such as eye and hearing controls."
New pale in recent vision treatment: Trifocal Lenses
Patients after cataract treatment do not want to use glasses naturally.
Multi-focused lenses have been already used since many years to solve this problem in our patients.
With the trifocal lenses that were started to be used in recent periods, one step further took the success of treatment in this area.
The difference of trifocal lenses from other lenses is not only remote or close distance, but also a clear view in distances defined as intermediate distance.
Treatment of remote, close or intermediate distance vision disorders
The interval distance in visual disorders represents a point that we use very often in our daily life.
The indicator panel of cars as an example is the distance between portable computers that we hold on our lap or as a arm length of 60-70 cm.
The intermediate distances of trifocal lenses also do not need to use glasses in any way that our patients do not notice close or remote.
Another advantage that Trifocal lenses provide is the reduction of night complaints.
Associate Professor of Eye Diseases. Dr. Volkan Hürmeriç "There is no difference in normal cataract treatment of trifocal lens therapy, which is applied for each distance vision treatment.  "
Our patients who apply Trifocal treatment have the eye health with a procedure of 7 to 10 minutes.
And our patients can return to their normal lives.
It is a operation that specifically uses cars, which is more than computer use, loves to read and increases the quality of life for people who have more active life.
You can also refer to the specialist of eye diseases to learn whether this procedure is suitable for you, which can be applied to every patient who has reached 18 years.
The varicose veins are not used in heart surgery!
Varis is a fairly increasing disease in recent years.
Genetic closeness is the primary factor; long working hours, work with a long-standing obligation to stop, and long-term living varicose veins cause increased complaints.
Is veins used in heart surgery?
What is done if I have varicose veins? Questions are often wondered by people.
Here are the answers to these questions.
There are two types of balls on the leg:
1. There are deep balls that take dirty blood into the lungs and collect the essential dirty blood of the chimney.
These are called deep femoral ven and superel femoral ven.
Problems in these balls are more rare, the vein in diseases can not be closed, and drug treatments are applied to remain open to these vessels.
There is a system of superficial balls that take dirty blood into the lungs and combine with deep balls in the groin.
This system consists of two large and two small safen ven balls.
In the dörd of these veins, it can develop insufficiency and varicose veins.
The balls that can be used in heart surgery are built in superficial balls called large safen ven.
There is no harm to the body, and therefore they can be used in heart surgery.
However, it is necessary to be healthy for the veins to be used in heart surgery.
Because heart is a very important organ.
The operation of varicose veins is taken by surgery or left on the laser, reduces the workload of deep balls and make the chimney more healthy.
A misconception between the people is that the varicose veins can be used as a replacement.
The varicose veins are never used in heart surgery!
There are other veins that can be used in heart surgery.
Back vessel systems that can be used in heart surgery; under chest cage, around the stomach and in the arm.
So the varicose veins are unable to wait for use for the heart and worry about it.

Scot Callum Skinner flies home when you cover the UK gold
The Great Britain Team tripled the title they received from London in 2012 while Scotland Callum Skinner ran to victory yesterday in the race of men in Rio racetrack.
Glasgowed, 23-year-old racer, the pioneering task of Scotland Sör Chris Hoy, and this young was proud of this legend when returning to the house with the new Zealand garment, who appreciates.
In the previous event that Hoy received five of the six Olympic gold, Britain had a shock victory.
And despite Hoy’s retired, in March, the Race World Championship held in London finished in the sixth row, they reconstructed it.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the expert starter Jamie Staff.
They made it exactly when Hindes appeared.
Hoy’s retirement also created a space where Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton works to fill.
Scot’s potential for which he had now been pre-expected and did not give up from the British coaches Skinner.
Four years ago, Hindes, the champion with Hoy, Kenny and Skinner ranking round broke the Olympic record, but in the first round, the New Zealand redefined this record.
And the UK triple appeared duel for gold.
Even though Hundas is a bit behind in his tour, Kenny team has brought forward and Skinner was also based on it.
A big part of the transformation, using a larger tool to slow itself, Kenny and especially Skinner, was this strategy change.
Hoy watched them from the BBC’s expert commentary, and was stuck in the eyes of Skinner, Kenny and Hndas when they exit the podium.
Glasgown, 23-year-old Skinner said: "This is a remarkable comparison.  "
I’m here to make the best of just coming from.
We broke the Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
This was really incredible.
It cannot be a better way to win.
Hundas admitted that after winning victory with Kenny and Hoy in London 2012, he fell from muscle on the runway.
He then reacted to this review and there was no method to claim the UK’s competitors.
This time, there was no such problem for an incredible victory.
Hundas said: "We were like in London as if we were together with all Great Britain flags in the stand.  "
We are a team that is only installed three months ago.
It’s a truly incredible feeling that we’ve won in the re Olympics so we’ve lost many world races.
This is just an event for a nation that wins seven of 10 races in both Beijing and London, a medal.
If the progress we have shown in the last five months, the racetrack will pass successfully five days more waiting for us.
Kenny’s attitude shows that Hoy’s three gold win record in a single Olympic is not very impossible.
This is also 12 years younger than Hoy, and he himself was born on 23 March (also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister’s birthday, a sacred date of British sports history) will mean Kenny’s six gold medals and reach a silver medal.
This means the same level with Hoy.
Kenny will come to the sprint race after that; the race will start today and last three days.
28-year-old Bolton, said: "I just enjoy it.
Team events are always the best events.
You can win with your friends.
To be honest, the person feels alone when he earns alone.
Hindes said: "If the two gold medals win more, the knight should not be given.  "
While this is only the event of this day’s medal, there are many good news for the UK.
Sör Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull completed ranking in four-kilometer teams race first.
Pisti completed in 3:51.943.
The world record set by winning gold medal in London 2012 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be determined in the second part of the present and the exact attention of Wiggins.
Prior to yesterday’s ranking tour, the authorities had a dispute with the duties when they call him to measure the neck.
In the event of women who will continue tomorrow and will be completed, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald from Milngavie reached the world record for 4:13.260.
The Great Britain Team relies on the strong bike team to address strings in the middle period of the Olympic Games and win many medals.
After showing great superiority in Beijing and London, the expectations in Rio were quite reduced.
In the background, technical director Shane Sutton's sexism and bullying crimes due to the retirement of important names such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton were experienced.
However, the first night after the races on the track shows that the reputation for finishing in the perfect time of the Great Britain can be proved again this time.
The future of Portland izabe quarry with the cancellation of the energy contract suspicious
The future of Portland aluminum izabe quarry in Victoria and the work of hundreds of workers led to the cancellation of all supply contracts of the energy company providing energy to the facility, one of the facilities owners fell in vague after a description of a supply contract.
This movement appeared after the decision that the Victoria government in the early this year took place in the direction of instillation of subsidies to continue to work.
The duration of 20 years fixed subside is completed in November.
Alcoa’s Portland facility can be at risk of up to 2000 work.
Any closing process can lead to direct or indirectly risk of work up to 2000.
And additional chaining effects may also occur because izabe quarry consume about 10 percent of the electricity of Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa Point Henry closed the quarry and led to the closure of Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland izabe facility loses money and faces the risk of closing.
These developments have emerged initially after speculations made for several years for the future of the facility based on the strengthening of Australian dollar and the consumption fee of the facility shortly.
AGL, which provides energy from the Loy Yang A power plant, located in Latrobe Valley in the large aluminum izabe quarry, expressed that the other three owners are expected to act in the direction of sacrifice.
A large majority of the resort belongs to the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, and China’s CITIC has smaller shares than Marubeni Corp companies in Japan.
"AGL is waiting for Portland facility to continue working, which means that the physical electricity demand of the izabe quarry will continue."
AGL expressed that contracts are "risk balancing contracts" that must be entered into force from November 2016.
As a 12 month period of termination of contracts, they will be completed in 2017.
The energy company said "Therefore, AGL will continue to wait for the contracts to contribute to the 2017 financial year."
AGL’s 2018 is limited to adoption a strong-term contract posture for electrical prices, in the current case that may be exposed to the Financial Year and after potential earnings.
AGL express the value of contracts in their accounts due to "feshin unexpected" from now to 187 million dollars.
Alcoa expressed that the decision on the termination of contracts "Alcoa's izabe quarry does not affect the ability to provide electricity supply to the business or izabe quarry."
The U.S. company signed a 20-year contract in 2010; this contract was supposed to enter into force in November this year, but yet it did not explain why this contract was withdrawn.
Analyzers trigger the possibility of closing the Portland izabe quarry in Victoria and the economic troubles in the industry of the Tomago facility near Newcastle.
At the beginning of this week, AGL’s operations controller, Stephen Mikkels, Portland’s about 600 megawatts, said Tomago also uses 900 megawatt energy.
If both of these facilities are withdrawn from the market, the request in the [electric] market will result in a considerable decrease.
And as a manufacturer, it would not be a good development for us."

People struggling with violence-containing relationships, management power and lumbar forces, families in the separation process and workers who are not fair work... All of these are encountering problems with legal dimensions, and they cannot access the help they need according to this report.

Audited asset fund re commission
The Turkish Asset Fund, which is expected to enter among the biggest funds in the world, was removed from the law of a quietly sedentary bag.
Due to the lack of the audit mechanism of the fund, it was decided to reconcile, but no changes were discussed again in the commission.
CHP MPs and Plan and Budget Commission Member Utku Çakırözer said "We are strictly against the provision of mandatory retirement interruptions to be received from the assets of the Republic, the laborer, the employees will be received from the unemployment fund collected for unemployed persons, except the Constitutional audit mechanisms."
The Turkish Asset Fund law proposal, which was prepared to provide long-term resources to government investments and projects, the opposition was also removed from the bar code on Tuesday with the opinion that it should be discussed.
However, AKP reclaimed the Plan and Budget Commission in the same form today’s offer.
A member of the CHP of the TBMM Plan and Budget Commission was told about the concerns and concerns of CHP concerning Asset Fund law offer.
Çakırözer said, "The establishment of this fund came to the Plan and Budget Commission in the bill of bag law, our former Minister of Finance at the beginning of the CHP delegation Zekeriya Cleanel expressed our concerns and concerns, which proposed that the bag is removed from the law and also to discuss in detail.  "
The government who accepted our opinion also withdraws the bill.
The design came to the commission yesterday in the same form.
"He said that in a week he insists on removing from the Assembly."
Occupying that the law of the Asset Fund should be an illusion, "Our biggest concern in this legal offer is ruleless.  "
"The assets that belong to the country, laborer, compulsory retirement interruptions to be taken from employees, incomes collected from unemployment fund for unemployed, incomes to be obtained from customization, except for the Assembly and the Issue inspection, and without any responsibility," he spoke.
This type of funds was established in Russia, China and the Gulf countries are oil revenues and commerce and said that the funds are funded in this way, "However we have a vulnerability.  "
That’s why the fund will consist of the public money, namely from public resources.
The total 100 billion in unemployment fund is planned to transfer 50 billion money from the individual retirement fund, which has become difficult for employees.
"This fund, which will consist entirely of the public money, is necessarily in public control, and this money needs not to be spent without questions."
Çakırözer emphasized that the state’s resources are unacceptable to hold outside the Assembly audit of a fund shown in the collateral of assets belonging to the debt, said concerns and concerns about the proposal of Asset Fund law:
Such a large collection of public presence, spending, business and operations relating to debt on the public behalf, not only controlled by the audit of independent audit companies.
Mutlaka must be a public control and a transparent structure.
In the law offer, there is no provisions on the Constitutional authorities control and transparency of the Asset Fund.
No limitations were brought on how much resources are transferred.
No one can ask the account on how this fund is used.
The financing of large projects as the purpose of the fund is shown.
For this, there is no need to build a unsupervised fund outside the budget.
Why do you get into the budget?
As such, naturally, the question "Why escapes from the control of the Council and the Assembly" comes.
One of the assets fund was not against the transfer of money to investments, but it continued to be said that it is not transparent, against the mechanisms that do not give account: "Do not need such a fund?  "
But if the government insists on this, then we have to ensure that the applicable international standards in other countries where such investment funds are established are also valid in Turkey.
Mutlaka is configured in a way the control and responsibility mechanism is brought.
It is necessary to be installed in a way that will not be schaibe, will give the account of its own money used to the citizen until the last penny.
Çakırözer, who absolutely draws the gold they are against in the form of commission to the asset fund law offer, "We are pleased to listen to our criticism in the Assembly, especially after the 15 July pulse attempt.  "
We hope that AKP’s constructive criticism in this legal offer.
We are against the use of national assets without a rule, misunderstanding, and non-governmental audit.
"Istenen Asset Fund but these concerns may be useful if they are removed."
Studies have been learned to provide ambiance between AKP and opposition on incoming law offering.

British Olympic spirit should be channeled and expanded Heathrow
Heathrow will only offer refresh and prosperity in our local communities and not in London.
I think this will make Heathrow quite attractive as it is in London 2012, which we show incredible effort to benefit from all nations and regions.
Olympics have provided great advantages for Stratford and East End.
And we will succeed again by creating opportunities for local people and companies near Heathrow.
Only 10,000 new internships for our local communities will create 40.000 new jobs and will not leave unworked young around the airport.
As before London 2012, they will be thinking that the struggle to expand Heathrow is too demanding.
It was said that we would never be ready for the Games of England and will be refrigerated to the whole world.
Those who are looking for were in 2012, and they will be seen in Heathrow.
It always takes obstacles to overcome but Heathrow responds to all questions asked.
As in the Olympics, Heathrow is not only a few people, but a infrastructure project for many people.
Expanding, 180.000 new business and 211 billion £ economical growth opportunities and allows many skills and jobs across the airport and across the UK.
From T5 in Heathrow (the best airport terminal in the world has been selected for five years) to T2, there is a great team that puts a infrastructure investment of £11 billion in time and budget for the world’s busiest two runway.
Now, we are ready to offer a third runway supported by private investment worth £16 billion.
London 2012 Games was a great success for the UK and I don’t doubt that the Heathrow expansion would be.
It’s time to secure our commercial future by channeling the growing of the Olympic spirit of Heathrow and creating many skills and business opportunities to be proud of the UK.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and the Commercial Secretary of the former Ministry of Treasury
Adblock Plus is "such as "kedi-fare game" on Facebook ad blocking
According to one of the companies that block advertising blocking software for money-winning companies from online ads, "kedi-fare game" is pushed.
On Thursday, Adblock Plus released a blog post that tells Facebook’s ad blockers to block on the desktop site only two days after Adblock Plus that users can update their filters to block ads on the social network.
On Tuesday, Facebook expressed that ad blockers will change codes around ads to harden what part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock says it has now solved new codes.
In a blog post, the Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote "I Williams has been inventing the ad blocking of open-source ads and trying to prevent them from being invented," and Facebook is able to produce their own solution in close time.
The world’s largest social media company’s fight shows how big ad blockers give birth to the industry.
Last year, Pagefair and Adobe is using advertising blocker of about 200 million people globally according to a study, which is four times the number of people who use software in 2013.
With 1,03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook with mobile devices, mobile ads now create 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue.
According to a spoke-person, mobile ad blockers have fallen in advance of advertising blockers on the company desktop, since Facebook’s mobile apps and Instagram are not effective for social network.
Facebook should be in case that it will be enough to become desktop ads based on it’s worth investing in such a move.
Again on Tuesday, Facebook announced that people will update the "rectile preferences" tool to check their ads better.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblock’s new filters are alarming, the non-interference content on the site will also block some.
A Facebook spokesperson said "This does not offer a good experience to people and we plan to take care of this problem."
Advertising blockers are a blinded tool, so we are focused on building tools like Advertising preferences to give control to people.
A woman enters the motorway of Switzerland by coccupied; the incident looks like suicide
The victim lays at midnight highway.
In the event that looks like police, suicide, looking for people who witness several vehicles in the motorway for early hours on Thursday.
The incident occurred in A1 near Morges in the Vaud canton immediately after midnight.
Vaud police said that in a statement, the woman lying on the darkness of the night, and a few vehicles hit him.
The 49-year-old Swedish woman who is open to kill herself, hit several vehicles, including truck.
He lost his life in the event.
The police expressed that drivers involved in the incident were discussed with several but some could not be detected, and everyone who included in their and incident asked them to apply.
The lawyer Gilles Hofstetter, Le Tribune de Geneve was opened in the description of the "manent" which will take place in cases such as "Bin".
However, it is not yet known that drivers involved in the event will not encounter any charges.
Is it possible to avoid collision?
This said, Hofstetter.
Two similar cases in the past five years show that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases in the newspaper (boths were included in a motorway in the dark), the drivers were ruled in the direction of not waiting for a pedestrian in the highway in the night half of the night.
Last year, in August 2014 a night in A1, a police officer whose death caused death by a police officer neglected death by multiplying a man lying on the road near Paynerne.
In the court, the 22-year-old victim was expressed that he was drinking, and he was leaked on the road.
The court expressesy that the police officer who responds to an emergency call is reasonably used, and the presence of a man on the road is "a exception and unforeseen situation".
Those who know about this event that takes place near Morges on Thursday should call the police from the phone number +41 21 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was fit to live once
According to the estimates of the new NASA climate model, there were conditions that are suitable for living once in Venus.
NASA Goddard developed a model to explore the history of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to the use of climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venezuelan is home to similar conditions in the world once with its warm, water-free surface and CO2 atmosphere.
Science people were explaining the low return speed of Venus in the past with the thick atmosphere layer.
But the newest predictions suggest that Venus has a fine, world-like atmosphere, and it can still slowly turn.
The model also looked at the topography of the old Venus.
Even though the planet has more dry zones than the Earth, it may have a protection against fast evaporation with sufficient water and geographical variables.
The old Venus was also used for a more than 30 percent of the sun.
GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio said that in the simulation of the "GISS model" the slow return of Venus was almost twice a day for almost two months," he said.
This led to rains that form thick cloud layers moving like a umbrella that protects the surface from sun-source warming.
As a result, today, only a few more cold average climate temperatures were revealed since the World.
The model has provided the creation of a similar story to the evolution, which previously suggests as the hypothesis of planetary scientists.
Although Venus has the conditions that are suitable for living at once, has been exposed to much heat and ultraviolet light in the process of several billion years.
It was steamed the oceans and no water vapor burned by ultraviolet ray.
Hydrogen exhausted and left behind only a thick atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, which has the effect of fatal greenhouse gas; i.e. Venus in the form we know today.
The researchers shared the results of the new Venus climate model in Geophysical Research Articles.
Patrick Roy stacked from Avalanche antennaor
Patrick Roy resigned from the task of vice president of Colorado Avalanche coach and hockey operations on Thursday, expressing that the team was not given the right to mention in the decision-making process.
Joe Sakic, the manager of the Colorado administrative vice president/genel, approved this development and stated that the club will start to call a new coach immediately.
The 50-year-old Roy said "For the past three years, I met my head coach and hockey operations in Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination."
During the summer I thought I could further improve how I needed this team and how I can maximize it.
To achieve this, coaching and VP hockey operations need to be in perfect harmony with the vision of the organization.
It is also necessary to have the right to mention in decisions that affect the performance of the team itself.
In the current case these conditions are not yet met.
He thanked Roy for his contributions to Roy in May 23, 2013.
Sakic said "Patrick's decision today."
We thank you for everything we do for our organization and wish plenty of luck in the future.
Roy was awarded Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league in 2013-14 with Avalanche.
Kulube gave 112 points and provided the team’s first finish, but Colorado was defeated to Minnesota in the first round of the play-off period, and in both years after season games were missed.
Avalanche passed 39-39-4 targets in 2015-16 and received five points less than required for the second wild space at the West Conference.
The fortresser Roy in the Honor List, two of the Montreal Canadiens won four Stanley Cup, both for Avalanche.
North Sea continues negotiations by hanging oil workers strike
Due to the fee of the North Sea oil workers, the strike was suspended, and the head negotiaters started discussions for a new meeting tour.
Oilfield services are gradually carried out on platforms in the North Sea, operated by strike Royal Dutch Shell against Wood Group.
In a common statement, we decided to restart the process for the solution of current dispute as "Wood Group and Unite and RMT unions," expression was included.
In the next few weeks, we will arrange a number of meetings that will last all day to adopt a new perspective against problems from the beginning of the next week.
Workers’ unions expressed that this protest against wage interruptions that may have 30 percent.
Wood Group cut approximately 9 percent in payments to contractors in the North Sea due to negative prints on the market.
After this fee reduction process of the company, the price discount was applied to the contractors on the coast in 2014 by 10 percent.
The company said that additional downtimes will provide the required space to the company to pass the troubled period in the market.
Shell has thousands of people work while organizing operations in the merger process with the British energy company BG Group and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low crude oil prices, an economic situation in which the decision in the direction of leaving the European Union in June.
Dave Anderson, a member of the Austrian Parliament, will discuss one of the biggest workers conflicts in the North Sea by meeting with workers leaders in the early this week.
As it says, the North Sea is vital for regional economy.
He said, "We need an effective economy for the majority, not for minority throughout the North Sea and the country."
Despite the investment of about 7 billion dollars in the average of the past five years, in 2016, it is expected to invest less than 1,4 billion dollars to new projects in the North Sea.
Kepler measured the rotation speed of stars in the countryr team star
Kepler space telescoping helped astronomers to create the most complete catalog in terms of return speeds of stars in the Ülker team star.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why the stars in the team star turn variable rapidly and understand the interest of return periods with the planet formation.
Luisa Rebull, a research scientist in the Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Caltech Pasadena, said "When we compare our results with star clusters, we hope that a star can learn more about the relationship between the mass, age and even the history of the solar system."
The countryr team star is away from the world of 45 light years.
Most of the stars in the team stars consist of 125 million years ago and reach the new level of adulthood.
They return to the highest speed possible throughout their lives.
On hill rotation speeds, the stars in this ripening stage constitute a large amount of stars wind.
These winds create a broken effect on stars as stars run in magnetic areas.
As soon as a star is older, the rotation speed starts to fall.
Kepler measures the rotation speed of each star through the appearance of noticeable star spots such as sun spots.
The latest return speeds catalog suggests that larger stars return faster than small stars.
Rebull expresses that the stars perform their return on the single foot of those who are big as they resemble dancers.
Rebull said, "We see that the slower rotatings are much heavier, fast rotating, very light stars."  "
As the countryr team star is very close, it acts as an ideal cosmic laboratory for comparison of rotation speeds.
Rebull said "The young and old team star provides theoretical models for star spins in both directions."
There are more things that we want to learn about how the return speeds of the stars fall, when and why they fall, if they are subject to the 'dans shoes' why they leave a corner.
Rebull and colleagues described in detail in three new articles that will be published in the Astronomy Magazine for short time.
