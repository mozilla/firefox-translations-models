The stars produce light and heat because of the energy created when merging (or melting) hydrogen atoms to make heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to build a reactor that produces the same energy.
However, solving this problem is very difficult and will take years to build useful fusion reactors.
The steel needle floats on the water due to the surface tension.
The reason for the surface tension is that the water-level molecules are attracted to more power than their high-air molecules.
Water molecules form an invisible shell on the surface of the water that causes objects like needles to float on water.
The used blade in modern skates on ice has a pair edge between which there is an indentation. The existence of two edges makes it better to have a better adhesion on the ice, even when it tilts.
Since the bottom of the blade is slightly bent, the edge that is in contact with the ice is also curved by the bending of the blade.
This will cause skating circulation. If the skateboard is tilted to the right, the skateboard will also go right, and if it turns left, the skateboard will go left.
To return to their previous energy level, they must be relieved of the extra energy that they have received from the light.
They do it by emitting a little bit of light called phosphorus.
Scientists call this process of inducing radiation because bright light causes atoms to induce and thus lead to photon light radiation, and light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows photon emitting atoms. Of course, in fact, photons are much smaller than the images in the image.
Photons are even smaller than the particles of atoms!
After hundreds of hours of work, the bulb string finally burns and the lamp no longer works.
Then the bubble of the lamp must be replaced. We must be careful when the bubble switching the lamp.
First, the key connected to the lamp must be switched off or the wire is disconnected.
The reason is that the electricity that goes into the socket at the location of the metal part of the bubble can give you severe electric shock if you touch the inside of the socket or metal base while it's part inside the socket.

The teeth of Tricertops could not only crush the leaves, but even the very hard branches.
Some scientists think that Tricertops ate from the fern, which is a common plant in Cretacea.
These plants look like a small palm tree with a crown of sharp leaves.
Tricertops could probably use his strong beak to dig the leaves before eating the trunk.
Other scientists believe that these plants are very toxic, so it seems unlikely that no dinosaur has eaten them, yet today lazy and other animals, such as parrots (of dinosaurs), can eat leaves or poisonous fruit.
How will Eve's gravity be affected by me? If you stand on Eve's surface, you will have less weight than your weight on Earth.
A person on the ground weighs 200 pounds (90 kg), weighing about 36 pounds (16kg) in lo. So less gravity draws you to it.

With the battle of France, Germany prepared itself to attack the island of England.
Germany encrypted the operation as the 30th operation of the cylinder. Most of the heavy and ready weapons of the British army were missing when he left Dunkirk, so the army was relatively weak.
But the British Navy was still much more powerful than the German Navy (Crigasmari) and could destroy any offensive fleet to the British Channel.
However, very few of the Royal Navy ships were stationed near possible attack routes because the Admirals were afraid to be drowned by the German Air Force.
Let's first explain the plans of Italy. Italy was originally the youngest brother of Germany and Japan.
Although they had just built four new ships before the war began, they had a weaker army and a weaker navy.

The submarines are ships built for a long time to travel under the water and stay there for a long time.
The submarines were used in World War I and II. They were very low and narrow, and their shooting were very limited.
At the beginning of the war, the submarines moved more on the sea, but by using the radar and the more accurate, they were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.

Learning to create interactive media requires conventional and traditional skills, as well as tools that have dominated them in interactive classes (creating Storybird, audio editing and video, storytelling, etc.)
Interactive design requires you to transform your assumptions about the production of media content and learn to have non-linear thinking.
Interactive design requires that different parts of a project be connected, but also consider as a separate entity.
The flaw of the lenses is that the focal complexity and the number of lens elements that are required to achieve the focal distance range is much more than the initial lenses.
As the lens manufacturers achieve higher standards in the production of lens, the problem is beginning to be solved.
It is possible to produce the zooming lenses of the quality of a comparable photo with the quality of the photo of the focus length.
Another flaw of zoom lenses is that the maximum diaphragm (speed) lens is usually less.
This has made it difficult to use cheap zooming lenses in dim environments without flash.
One of the most common problems when turning the film into a DVD format is to extract the image from the box.
Most of the TV is made to be the favorite of the people.
For that reason, whatever you see on TV, its edges are cut from above, down and on both sides.
This is made to ensure it is made up to the image properly displayed in the entire screen. It is called overscan.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, the edges are likely to leave the box, and if the video subtitles are too close to the bottom of the image, they will not be shown.

The balance of power was a system in which European governments sought to establish the right to rule in all European governments.
The idea was that all European nations had to try to prevent the power of another nation, and for that reason, national governments often changed their allies to maintain balance.

The military nature of the Roman Empire helped develop medical advances.
The Emperor Augustus began recruiting doctors and even formed the first Roman physicians to use after the battles.
Surgeons knew about various sedatives, including morphine, which are taken from poppy seeds, and scopolamine, which is taken from the bang seed.
They were skilled in saving patients with gangrene in amputation and also to prevent blood flow in the use of tornadoes and arteries.
Over many centuries, the Roman Empire achieved great achievements in the field of medicine and formed a large part of our modern knowledge.

MySpace is the third most popular website used in the United States and currently has 54 million profiles.
These websites, especially in educational space, are very interesting.
There are positive aspects for these websites, which include the ability to adjust a class sheet that can include blogs, films, photos and other features.
It can only be accessed to this page by presenting a web address, which makes it easy to remember and type it for students who are probably having trouble using keyboard or spelling words.
It can be customized to read easier and with the color of the color as much as possible.
The malfunction disorder is a neurological syndrome whose triple symptoms include irritability, distraction, overactive or excessive energy.
This phenomenon is not learning disability, but learning disorder; ing, between 3 to 5 percent of all children are infected, probably about 2 million American children.
Children have a lack of attention disorder to focus on things like work, but they can focus on things that are enjoyable for them, like playing or watching their favorite cartoons or writing sentences without punctuating symptoms.
Since the brains of these children are not stimulating in normal ways, they generally suffer a lot of problems, because they express their own dangerous behaviors and engage in a fight and challenge the authority of the person.
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other children cannot understand why they act in this way or why they spell in this way or whether their maturity levels are different.

The fossil hand bones, dating two million to three million years, show the hand change in expertise to manipulate.
Some people believe that the experience of many transparent dreams that are artificially induced can often be very overwhelming.
The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of transparent dreams that lengthens the time between the rapid movement of the eye in the sleep.
As the eyes are less slow in the night sleep, the state that you go to real sleep and your body is retrieved is so little that it becomes difficult.
It's just so overwhelming that you're going to wake up every ten or twelve minutes and watch TV.
The effect depends on how often your brain tries to see a clear dream every night.

Perhaps the most common kind of tourism is the case that most people consider to be associated with travel: Recreational tourism.
That is, when people go to a very different place than their daily lives to rest and entertain.
Coasts, recreational parks and camping places are often the most common places where recreational tourists invade.
If the purpose of a person's visit to a particular place is to familiarize its history and culture, this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists may visit the views of a particular country or focus only on one region.
Colonists also asked for reinforcements by observing the activity.
The forces that had the mission to strengthen the positions were the first and third group of New Hampshire, with 200 men led by Colonel John Stark and James Reed (who were both later generals).
The stars were stationed along the fence at the north end of the colony.
When the low tide made a pause along the Mystic River along the northeast of the peninsula, they quickly spread the fence with a low stone wall to the north, at the end of which was placed on the edge of the water on a small beach.
gridlia and the star of a wooden pole put about 100 feet (30 meters) in front of the fence and ordered them not to fire until the ordinary forces had crossed it.
The American plan relied on the implementation of coordinated attacks in three different directions.
General John Cadwallader launched a detour against the British garrison in Bordertown to block the path of any reinforcements.
General James Ewing took 700 militants to the river in Terenton, the bridge surrounded the SAN-Park Crick and prevented the enemy from escaping.
