RBS suspended two forex traders
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Foreign Currency Exchange Department, with the case, the information received from two people, is other indications that the global check-up made by regulators in the dubious manipulation of the currency market is moving at a speed.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS have confirmed that in the world’s largest financial market with $5.3 trillion exchanges each day, they are collaborating with regulators in the investigations.
Both of these traders will be the first employee of RBS, which has been suspended with a check-up proceeding of the case that appears to be the recurrence of Libore Interbank Loan Manipulation Scandal.
The Bank has confirmed that the Bank has received a request for information from regulatory this month.
Two weeks ago the bank said, “In this case our investigation continues, and we are fully collaborating with FCA and other regulators. ""
Last month, the people from the case had said that RBS has sent the former trader and sent the records of email and instant messages received from them to the UK regulatory, Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader named Richard Yusher left RBS in 2010, and is believed that it has been discharged from its current position of the European Head of Forex Spot Trading in J.P.Morgon.
Rohan Ramchandani, the head of European Spot Trading in the City, took over the last week, while former senior currency trader in Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
Any of these traders are not accused of any wrong actions.
The Vigyan people from the case pointed out that the accelerated messaging group of M. Yushar consists of Barclays and Bankers of Citigroup.
UBS said that, after the Swiss regulator, Finma said that he is investigating the suspected manipulation of the forex market in a lot of Swiss backs, this week he has taken action against some of his employees.
At least six authorizations globally – European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s Competition Authority are examining allegations to be misrepresented in VCO, FCA, US Department of Justice, and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – Bankers to make their favourable fluctuations in the currency market.
Those familiar with the case informed that HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also investigated internally, or received a request for information on behalf of regulators.
Banks are closely scrutinizing instant messages and emails equal to several years in search of a wrong activity leads.
News about investigation-responsibility, has given a scenic movement in traders from the region, which has been among the most benefiting major individuals in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, as the opportunities for bookmakers have decreased due to low fluctuations in the curensories.
Some bankers attempted to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very vast and highly liquid forex exchange market, but senior traders say that it is not necessarily true.
Senior traders said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms despite the excessive magnitude of the foreign currency purchasing-exchange and the growing use of their own platform by banks means that "you can begin to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price. ""
The news came on the same day, on which Credit Suisse had announced the trader to be serviced this week from his Excense Traded Funds Desk in London, which led to a loss of about $6 million at the end of the previous year.
The Bank immediately notified coherent authorities and has been collaborating with its regulators.
“We believe that the trader had acted alone, and has been controlled. ""
New politics of making board changes in municipalities started.
Recently the Congress leadership board in Santhia municipality of Veerbhum district changed to the Board of Juanya due to the delegation of the palms.
It was altered due to joining the ethos of most of the congresses including the chairman of the municipal.
Not only the Congress but also some of the leaders of Makpa, Bhakpa and Forward Block have also taken the suppression of the Jupiter here.
Taranyaan Congress Secretary-General Mukul Rai considers it auspicious sign for the party.
He says the chairman of Santhia municipality joined the 10-Parad Taranya of Congress, including Virendra Parik and Congress leader Viplav Datta.
Some of the tops of the Vamporcha, including Makpa, have also taken the flag of the stem.
All has written the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Jupiter and the Santhia Municipal Board has also come under the control of the Jupiter as per the number force.
Shri Rai also claims that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s leadership agrees to the development of Bengal which has been decided.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, Makpa, Bhakpa, and Forward Block are proceeding to join the Juanya Congress.
Welcome to any party-worthy leaders.
Prior to the election of five municipalities that take place on November 22, the capture of the Jupiter on the Palika Board is being considered to be critical in political circles.
Earlier, Vamporcha is an example of the annexing of the entanglement on the Congress Governance Board in Haldia and Nadia.
The districts have a grand reception in Kolkata-based turban building to those who are involved in the party due to the change of the group.
The Jupiter Congress Secretary-General Mukul Rai is enthusiastic about being broken by other parties and joining the Jupiter of leaders.
He says that any party is welcome to the tune of broken people.
He claims that the state of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing whose results are that people would like to join the Jupiter.
While the main opposition party Makpa says that the leaders of the lower level of other parties are being feared.
People are getting involved in fear of the terror of the Tarnamool Congress.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is posing a trauma on Makpa democracy.
In a democratic manner, any party has the right to increase their ideology, but the reason for not making changes in the item of power is to raise the question.

The media coverage on the side of Asaram is being introduced to them as a children’s blood drinker Dracula, but the court dismissed their demand to stop media coverage.
The back of Chief Justice P. Satshivam refused to order the media from running news about Asaram, saying that they have seen every word reported in the media and there is no reason to make them look at.
How can we stop them when they are gaining information from police and other people.
Earlier, Asaram’s lawyer accused the media that he is showing news about them by increasing them.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
When they enter the case against what they do, the back did not affect these parties and refused to interrupt the case, saying they have more options.
The demand for stopping the court media coverage once before it has been cleared.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
Work by HS2 indicates high speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will begin soon with the first phase in 2026.
The Transport Minister Baroness Cramer reported that the project will be “britain one.” ""
Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said they are very “excited” by working with the UK government on this project.
The first stage will include the new high speed rail line between London and West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will reach Manchester and Leads.
In June the government revised the cost of building high speed links between London and North England by £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was interacting with Scotland transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider the rail potential for North England and Scotland and the chances of improving the travel time.
It includes the possibility of reducing the potential travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London three hours or less.
According to Baroness Cremer: “Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring close to UK and its cities. ""
We are moving with HS2 as its benefits will be very high.
Without this we will face problems related to the ability of our rail network.
But it’s also about the connectivity of the UK’s 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be well added due to HS2. .
“Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland,” according to the Scottish Secretary Ellistair CarMicell. ""
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to the “clear” return of Scotland in the HS2 network from Mr. Carmikell.
“Scottland is likely to have huge economic benefits from high-speed rails, but it will also increase economic loads on Scotland throughout the UK in case of high-speed rails.
So we are enthusiastic about working in the partnership of the British government, so that we can check the options for bringing high speed rails in Scotland, generating benefits for all and fulfilling the Glasgo-Edinburg line, whose Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British government ministers next year and making decisions together on further action.

These people are damaging their image and reporting unilateral.
In this case, the right of Asaram should be protected.
The Court refused to stop the media from reporting, but Asaram’s lawyer said they have other legal remedies that he can use.
Black box in your car?
While the U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to improve the highway system while many people are looking for solutions in a small black box that fits with your car’s dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile run by the motor-driver and transmits the information to the authorities, has now become an issue of a controversial effort for Washington and State Planning Office to promote the major roads of the US.
Generally, boring work like highway planning has also become an issue of sudden deep debate and vibrant coalitions.
You have found the Libaretarian Environmental Groups to raise support in favour of allowing the government to use these black boxes - to make use of this information, and possibly to keep details of the space drived by you.
The tea party is wandering.
The U.S. Citizens’ Freedom Association is also very worried about picking up a variety of privacy issues.
While Congress does not agree on whether to do further proceedings, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can go into such a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for each miles fixed on the road.
Thousands of motor-drivers have already taken the black box for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is really essential for our country.
“It’s not a matter of being selected or selected by us” says Hassan Ikhrata who is the Executive Director of the South California Government Association, plans to start tracking each miles fixed by motor-drivers in California by 2025.
We are going to change the way we pay.
technology to do this.
The main reason for this to happen is that the country’s highway trust fund has become nearly bankruptcy, which is financed by US citizens by paying taxes on gas pumps.
Americans don’t buy gas as before.
Now the car in a gallon gas runs more miles than ever.
There was no hike in the last 20 years in the Federal Tax, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Being a high value of gas, politicians also avoid an increase in tax.
“Gas Tax is not absolutely vascular,” says Li Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota. ""
Their state has recently put a tracking device in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
They say, "In the course it will work as the most reasoning option. ""
Wonx call it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea looks good to urban liberals, as it can make changes in taxes for example to change the form of a car, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California planners are eager to this system while they are developing strategies to complete the target set in the State’s equitable global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (A-PA) also considers the black box as the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors in the Region Foundation are also in favour of pay per miles by the driver.
“It’s not merely doing what’s going into blind well,” said Adrian Moore, Vice President of the Policy in Reason. ""
There are more direct payments for people who are receiving.
The campaign has also been supported by two former U.S. transport secretaries who had graced the Congress to proceed towards per-mile payment in their report in 2011.
U.S. Senate had approved a test project of 90-million dollars last year, including 10,000 cars.
But while working on the concerns of rural method-makers, who were representative of individuals who have to go to work daily or walk a lot of miles to go to the city, the leadership of the House eliminated that motion.
Yet many states and cities themselves are moving towards this direction.
It has the most inclined Origone, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the initial test.
New York City is also moving towards this direction.
Illinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the 17 State Transport Department (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) with the East Seaboard, is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support in all places.
In Nevada, where this device was imposed on cars of 50 voluntary car drivers a short time ago, the driver was very slow to think that the government can monitor each of their steps.
Alouddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management in the Nevada Transport Department, says “Big Brother and other things of the same type had a major problem. ""
This is not something that people wanted.
With the advancing of the test, Nevada’s ACLU warned on its website: “It will be quite easy to convert these devices into a complete tracking device. ""
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanaged technology framework that needs to be spread to each individual’s everyday record.
Nevada is among the many states that have been making every effort to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get the details of how many miles the car is running daily, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that people can feel more comfortable if you can do so.
The search for this technology brought some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was basically not in business to assist state tax drivers.
It was trying to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which the drivers had to pay based on their mileage.
But the device that is testing, the highway planners looked good, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem on the fixed time interval.
“They will be more inclined to adopt this way if you don’t track people’s speed and their location,” said Tru Mileage’s Chief Executive Rayon Morrison. ""
These preliminary programs of the state have caused some major mistakes.
There are less costly and less intervention methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using giving different options to drivers.
They can choose a device of GPS with or without GPS.
Or choose not to take any device again, but can choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be decided by the residents of the state.
Other locations hope that the concerned citizens can be sold to it by providing more convenience instead of less in the device.
In the New York City, the transport authorities are trying to develop a taxing device that will also facilitate the payment of parking meter fee, provide "Payment as per their drive" insurance, and the real-time speed from other drivers will create a collection of data that can be used to avoid motor-driver traffic.
The city is mentioned in the planning document, “Motor-driver will attract participation in it due to the benefits it receives. ""
However, some transport planners are surprised that there is a big distraction on payment as per miles.
Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Gulf region has said that Congress can deal very easily with the problem of the bankruptcy highway trust fund by increasing gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual charges can also be levied on the drivers of hybrids or other cars whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their proper portion.
“When working with aspirin, what is needed for a common surgical need for him,” said Rondi Rentsell, Director of the Commission’s legislation and public affairs. ""
If we do this, crores of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and other things.
Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: The security of former Minister Gulam Hasan Khan, who joined Congress from the People’s Democratic Party, has allegedly removed the police.

CDC issued allergy guidelines of children for schools
On Wednesday, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling children’s food allergies in the school.
For the first time such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children visiting the school suffer from food allergies is increasing.
Now one of every 20 in the U.S. is food allergies to the baby.
CDC found that 18 percent increase in food allergy cases in children between 1997 to 2007.
In this direction, schools have been informed about how teachers and employees are informed about the food allergy of children, and how to handle them in case of an allergic reaction.
The schools are also suggested to keep the stock of Epnephrine to potentially face the Janaleva Sharpness (Anafylaxis) - which is the auto-injector of the APPEN brand that is most commonly used.
The State Assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing the Vidyalaya to keep the stock of the Apnephrine in excess.

Children can say "It seems that something is going to be in my tongue," "It seems that my tongue has hair", or "my tongue is getting annoyed." ""
Aircraft electrical equipment regulations will be effective in Australia now
The entanglement of the softness moves in equipment related regulation in the US, the Australian Airlines will continue to close their telebelets and smart phones while flying passengers and landing aircraft.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option to change its processes to the U.S. aircraft service companies, so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their equipment during the critical stages of flight, provided they remain in the equipment "Aircraft" mode.
Passengers can do this during a lot of flights right now, but many people don’t have to be unable to access their e-books etc. while flying and landing the aircraft.
Australian aircraft service companies are considering this decision, according to which US aircraft service companies have to act much more to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plan to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Security Authority also stated that he is considering the announcement, but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still effective in the critical stages of flight in Australia.
“At present, CASA does not have any specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft,” the authorization said, “This issue comes under regulation, according to which the aircraft service operations companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and passengers have to comply with the safety instructions provided by crew members. ""
Virgin who is already interacting with CASA about extending the use of his in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system is willing to follow this change, but he asked to take further action on the regulatory instructions.
The spokesperson said that “We will welcome the review by CASA in case of permission to use electrical appliances, as we really think it will provide better experience to customers, because now we have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes.
Kwantas said it will follow the current rules right now.
“Electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing aircraft according to our current policy, and we have no immediate plans to convert it. ""
FAA decisions apply to US allerlines.
By the way, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit passengers and we will definitely consider the decisions of FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary on each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Aeration service companies will need to authenticate that their aircraft can bear radio dissatisfaction with mobile devices, as well as amend them to give short details to their rules, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and passengers.
FAA said that “After verification of the tolerance of their aircraft by airlines, he will allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electrical appliances such as tweezlets, e-readers and smartphones on all heights. ""
In sparse cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to close their equipment while landing the plane.
The group has also suggested placing heavy equipment safely under the seat or in upper compartments while flying and landing the aircraft.

The alleged trading firm cited the investor’s account by opening the shares in the name of the purchase-foreign.
The first time in the state has probably come to the point of the rupee of crores.
At the moment the police have not reached it, who is the resurrection of the gang, but the police have detained seven people, including the accused of seeing his work in the state.
This gang operated a fake commodity market in the name of Metatrader-5.

External Affairs Minister John Kerry unpredictably acknowledged that in some cases American spy has crossed the extent.
Also he claimed that innocent people have not been depressed under the intelligence monitoring program.

Kerry said I assure you that innocent people in this process are not depressed.
But unsuitable methods have been adopted in some cases in an effort to gain information.
Meanwhile an important committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill limiting monitoring activities of the National Security Agency [NSA].
Its motive is to further transparent monitoring and restore the confidence in people who have been hurt by revealing a massive phone tape.
The senate’s move is welcomed by six US companies including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also established the data centers of these companies.
Senate’s Poverty Committee passed the Foreign Intelligence Monitoring Reform Bill [FISA] from 4 votes against 11 on Friday.
The Bill mentions several sanctions including stopping to do a lump sum phone tape under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, its use will be deemed to be a crime by collecting data intentionally unauthorized and provision of a sentence of ten years of prison for this.
The Bill will become the law after the two Houses of Congress passed in the House of Representatives and Senate.
President of the Committee and Senator Diane Fastin said that the program of recording the phone of the NSA is under law and I believe it has contributed to the security of the country.
However, there should be more transparency.
That is, the safety of public privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Angry Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported this Bill from revealing the NSA’s internet monitoring program.
In the letter to the Senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of MPs curbing a massive phone record of the NSA.
It is important that former CIA staff removes the curtain from NSA’s duties from documents issued by Edward Snowden.
The NSA has a special resentment in the international community after monitoring the telephone of 35 countries including Germany and France.
John Kerry in unintended confession said that the U.S. spying "have gone very forward inappropriately"
John Kerry has indicated to soften the protective attitude of the U.S. on its surveillance program by accepting the unintended form that sometimes its spying "the inappropriately goes much further. ""
The Minister of State has also acknowledged that they are also convicted with Barack Obama in case of being on “Automatic Pilot” as a rebellious disclosure towards the Mukhbir Edward Snowden, about coming to the front of the spying activities of NSA.
This revelation has brought the Government of the U.S. diplomatic land in relation to its affiliated countries.
Speaking through the video link at the free government conference in London, Shri Kerry said: “There is no question that the President, me, and other people in the government were really aware of some of the things that happened with automatic pilots, because the Second World War, and the Difficulty Years of Cold War, and then, of course, had its potential in 9/11.
They have become the first high-class members of the U.S. government who have accepted that the U.S. spying has led to its limitation, but has emphasized that no rights were misused.
He said: “In some cases, it has gone unsuitably too forward. ""
And the Presidents are determined to try to make it clear for the people and are now reviewing intensively so that no person has an expression of abuse.
I am convinced that there is nothing wrong with unhappy people in this process.
Shri Kerry stressed that, however, NSA was striving for good purpose, and its monitoring work has saved many lives.
He further told: “We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves. ""
There is radical extremism in the world, which is categorized to kill people and attack governments.
So what’s the trouble if you’re able to stop it before it’s happening?
We have actually saved the aircraft from falling down, demolishing buildings, and killing people as we have been able to learn about others’ plan in advance.
Meanwhile, President of the European Affairs Senate Vice-Committee on Thursday said that the U.S. legality will go to Europe to help address concerns abroad regarding the so-called U.S. spying, and European countries will try to convince the need to continue the anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Chris Murphy, the Senator of Concticat, said he has talked to the members of the European Parliament this week and was worried about the threats of the anti-terrorism organisations due to the frustration of monitoring by the National Security Agency.
“It’s really important for U.S. national security interests that the European countries are with us in terms of our anti-terrorism efforts. ""
European countries need to continue working together to fight terrorism, which should not be affected by their anger about the NSA program.
The news of recording millions of phone conversations in Europe by NSA has brought about the relationship with some of the U.S. associate countries, although the head of the agency said that these news are not completely correct, and the NATO represents the misconception of the metadata shared with the United Nations networked by the collaborative nations.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that NSA has monitored cellphones of 34 other top leaders in the world, including German Chancellor Agenla Merkel.
The National Intelligence Director James Claper described him as necessary while defending the incident of spying on allies and said it is common to be done by both parties.
Among Hangme, Murphy said that his office is organizing a Congress trip that is likely to be this year, and he hoped that the delegation would include both parties and members of both chambers.
The names of other method-makers participating will be issued in the coming days.
He is still working on the Travel Program.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the journey is to improve the relationship, he said that some “individual relations” will also have to be abandoned.
He said that European leaders will also have to be honest to their spying programs used for years, with their people.
“We can modify our monitoring program to better protect European people’s rights, but they also need to agree that the only ones we are not spying. ""
During this weekend, Mr. Carrie’s Middle East and Poland is a programme where he will address the Vidyush about U.S. monitoring activities from the U.S. strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
NSA accuses “Internal Error” instead of hackers to crash the website
The mystical national security agency said on Friday that due to some technical lack our website was closed for a few hours, and not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
“NSA.gov was not in access to several hours on night, which was caused by internal error during pre-defined updates,” said Intelligence Agency in the email sent statement. ""
This problem will be solved today.
The claim is not true that it came due to the constraint, distributed deny of service [DDOs] attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSA website was closed for at least six hours, and the site is still not accessible for some users.
NSA spokesperson told ABC News that “Bill was not even “understanding” with the internal, sensitive network of the agency.
The spokesperson said that no classified information is at risk.
At least one of the Executive Group has claimed online that they are responsible for constraining NSA’s website by DOS attack.
D.D.O.S. attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent so much on the target website until the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and attacks are not intended to distinguish the internal network of target systems.
The former highly mystical NSA, sometimes named “no such an agency,” has become the subject of discussion and dictation criticism among the common people by coming to the events of a large number of foreign and domestic spying programs over the past months – The former NSA contractor who was collectively displaced by Edward Snowden was stolen from the agency and after revelation.
Due to the increasing dispute about the agency, today such speculations were imposed after the night event that the event was the result of the targeted cyber operation.

Frontier Airlines Carry - Charge On Baggage
Carrying luggage for passengers on your aircraft board in Frontier Airlines – plans to charge $100 to on-store.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry - on bag and it will charge $2 for coffee or soda, however on Wednesday its announcement pointed out that passengers can keep the whole box.
The new carry - on duty is for bags in overhead bin, therefore, the small bag under the seat will still be freed.
Frontier said that $25 will charge if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier Spokesperson Kate O’Mally said $ 100 percent of passengers have to acquire charge in advance.
“We don’t want to charge it,” he said.
Airlines started charging for first and second check bag in 2008.
Those who are trying to avoid passenger charges are stuffed as much as they can carry - in on baggage which is stash in overhead compartment, this means that this cans often have less space.
The fee is a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O’Mally said it’s not really about raising new charging money.
It has become increasingly hard to find that the location of overhead bin is for the most loyal customers about Frontier.
Travelers who buy tickets in their own website of airline do not have to pay this.
This means that the next person in the line may have to pay 100 dollars for a similar bag while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate, a bag can get free.
O’Mally said the processes of Frontier’s website and check in are being changed To ensure that passengers know about the fees before they get the gate.
Frontier’s new carry – on fees, will not start until summer though a date has not been set.
Passengers often reveal diss dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but aircraft services prefer them.
They argue that the baggage costs money to handle, and those who want passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after many years of airline losses that are seen as many as a sign.
Although most of the carry-on bag charges are not touched.
Spirit Airlines Inc. Carrie - On-charge started the first time three years ago, and Partner Discounter Allegiant Air later.
One such fee as well as other airline hungary’s Wizz Air, which said Airline Advisor J. Sorensen, and who tracks add-on fees.
He added that Spirit’s Carry – On Charge brings $50 million a year which was estimated in December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former officer of the Midwest Airlines recently flew into the spirit and surprises passengers on the gate-carry-on unusual bag fees.
“The boarding process was comfortable which I saw in my airline career,” he said.
I expected to see the teeth grinding and out on a battle gate.
“The demand was full and he ascended it lickety-split. ""
Frontier is also following $2 charges of Coffee, Tea, Soda, or Spirit for Juice.
Frontier Neckha that will take passenger soda, or juice they can keep the whole box, and it will give free coffee for only once.
It will still give water away.
The US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but after the passengers complained they retreated and no other main airline followed after being there.
Frontier's passengers have their fresh efforts to operate this step of Frontier to charge the fee on the carry - if not directly purchase from the airline.
Airlines online travel seller pays Orbitz such as $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That’s why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone ahead in this area.
Several frequent flights in September took half a distance to the customers who bought from an online travel agency from these individuals
On Wednesday it reduced the Mileage Award by 25 per cent of the trip miles.
So, an 1000 miles Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows you to choose your seat in advance for sole travelers on purchasing directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier’s Denver has a faithful base of customers in the city of its home, but its business is becoming less and it is losing money.
The decline of 9 per cent in revenue and its flight capacity is reduced by about 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results released Wednesday by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
As part of the sale of Republic Airline are trying to decide the finances of Frontier.

Scientists have further highlighted the topic of what the relationship between the dog’s tail in the herds and its mood.
Last researches have shown that happy dogs shake their milk more on the right side (by the sight of the dog), while restless dogs shake their tails more mainly on the left.
But now scientists say that the partner can recognize this subtle distinction of the dog tail and react to it.
This study is published in the Journal of Kurt Bailoji.
Georgia Vallartigera, a neuroscientist professor from the University of Trento, told: “In the brain all well know that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the excitement that arises positive or negative emotions. ""
Here we have tried to see it in other species.
He told that the right part of the brain in dogs like humans was responsible for the movements of the hand and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral smiling by other dogs, researchers monitored animals watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
We’ll probably not take much time to understand why they sometimes move on one side to another.
Pro. Vallartigara reported: "We introduced dogs with dogs' films - in the shadow-picture to deal with other issues that put in the realistic version or confused, and we could see the front of the tail and present the tail more left or right. ""
When animals saw a bully dog shaking his tail to the right side (in the sight of the dog) they remained completely relaxed.
But when he turned the tail direction mainly to the left (reviously the dog’s vision) he saw his heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
Pro. They do not think that dogs were deliberately communicating each other through these herms, according to Vallartigara.
Instead, they feel that dogs have learned from their experience on which everybody they should be worried and not on.
He said: “If you have found many times from other dogs, and if they constantly shake their tail on one side it is related to more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience. ""
Researchers say that these findings can provide better information about animals’ emotions to owners, veterinarians and instructors.
The University of Bristol’s School of Veteranary Sciences guest Fellow, experts at the behavior of dogs John Breadshoe reported that it is not the first study to check whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
The team of the University of Lincoln last year found that when dogs see an aggressive dog, their heads rotate to the left and their heads rotate to the right when they see the happy dog.
In other research from University of Victoria in Canada, he pointed out: “Unlike the Italian study – when the tail of the robot dog was shaken to the left, it was more likely to reach near him instead of being restless of the dogs. ""
He said that these differences were because in various studies did not fully understand animals or robot dogs in dog films.
He clarified that it can help study how to react to real dogs by dogs.
“When different mammals have found considerable evidence that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, getting more detailed information is still the rest – and in this case the dog is not exception,” he said.
However, seeing the ease of which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that we will probably not take much time to understand why their milk sometimes moves on one side to another.
New Research has revealed that we work with complete honesty and dedication at the morning.
Don’t lie with anyone and don’t feel like stealing or cheating.
But when evening, our mind changes and we keep the norm on one side.
Researchers have given many interesting facts in this research of David Eklas School of Business of Harvard University and Uto.
According to researchers, we prefer ethical values while not having the stress of work in the morning, but sincerity decreases due to fatigue or greater pressure as soon as the evening.
Researchers used two for this.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
Muscled, people had to tell that the point is higher on the left or on the right side.
Participants said that they will be given money if they are wrong answers instead of the correct answer.
This experiment saw that in the morning between 8 to 12 people used He did not make any mistakes and responded correctly.
While experimenting on people between 12 and 6 pm, they found that they deliberately misreported by placing their bodies on the tack.
Researchers managed to prove that no matter our sincerity in the morning cravings, but when the evenings, we stop giving up morals.
This research is published in the fresh points of Psychological Science.

It is true that we cannot work without money.
Wealth is one of the biggest needs for life awaits, but it is not in our interest to assume everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras to Krishna Triodashi of Kartik Mass.
Dhanteras is worshiped by the deity of wealth Kuber and the deity of the deity of death.
There is a significant place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Our sense of wealth is good.
There may be no other thing to be valued by the wealth that came to the welfare of humanity, but there is no sense of money that led to egoism.
Earn money for the Holy purpose and spend the Holy purpose only.
The duty of every person is to earn money for family fill-nutrition.
Part of this should also be a sense of spending on society, but the tendency to earn unhistakable collection or yen-ken-typed funds is our discretion, the destruction of personality.
The spirit of charity should always remain in mind.
A fraction of the wealth you give can also become the basis of the life of anyone.
Many people in society are living in fearful deprivation, we must think of all.
The meaning, religion, work and salvation have been equal importance in the men of life in fact.
All people wish for wealth and blessings and they also receive wealth and blessings according to their efforts.
The same wealth is durable with which respect is connected.
No matter how much a criminal is wealthy, he can neither consume it correctly nor work of another.
Do not trust anyone else if you have money.
The true wealthy is the one who made the way of flowing into the myriad hands of wealth.
There may be no use of money by increasing the creation of employment for others.
Another thing, the money is not only as currency.
It also happens as your health, character, love to others.
Try to become a master of the same wealth.

Now these students can get admission.
The Department of Medical Education has started churning to revive the admission of these students after the establishment of STF.
According to information, the department is waiting for all these suspected students to meet STF.
The list will be sent to the business to repay the eligibility of the students involved.
However, in this case, the department is talking about taking legal advice.
The departmental authorities say that the students who have entered the year 2012 have been one year, so it is necessary to take legal advice in this case.

The new anti-nicotene vaccine can end up enjoying smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotene vaccine, which can eliminate the fun from smoke.
The same dosage of vaccine, was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction to whole life.
Before the test is initiated on human beings requires further tests, which may take several years, but in New York, Professor Ronald Crystal, Vel Cornell Medical College, said that the amphitic signs are positive.
“We hope that this type of vaccine strategy can ultimately assist millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods in the market in today’s time, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is more powerful than these existing methods. ""
New vaccine has a harmless virus designed to provide genetic information with the aim of creating an anti-nicotene antibodies.
This virus, selectively infects the liver cell, which after that it begins to create a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibodies search for any nicotine molecule in the blood, and prevent them from getting rid of nicotine in the smoker before they reach the brain.
In the test, vaccinated rats that were subsequently given nicotine continue to perform their normal activities.
Researchers say that but the rat that was not given vaccine was “good”, it was a sign that nicotine had reached its brain.
This experiment was described in the journal called Science Translational Medicine.
The vaccine of the first tobacco failed, because they had an antibodies.
It had to give a dose at regular intervals, so that the levels of antebodies remained, but they proved to be costly and impractical.
But the new vaccine price is expected to be very much, as the liver will make the cell of the antebodies factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine was completely safe, it can be given to children, before the greed of cigarettes tried, thereby protecting them from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used to quit smoking by smokers.
He said “He will know that if they start smoking again they will not get any pleasure from smoking due to the vaccine of nicotine, which can help to sneeze their habit.
British scientists pointed out the results, but warned of the need for much more research.

Allegation of sexual offences on two employees of YMCA prior to allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission hearing
Earlier to be accused against Caringaah Child Care Staff Jonathan Lord in the year 2011, the crime of child sexual offences has been imposed on two employees of YMCA NSW.
But in his statement before the Commission said that it did not “sometimes the case of child sexual harassment came out within his organization,” the Commission was told.
The Chief Executive Officer Philip Green was asked about the matter in which an employee of the YMCA was accused of child pornography crimes, and another case in which the YMCA was accused of child sexual offence against children in care of him in 1991.
Mr. Green from the advocate Gail Furness, who assisted the Commission said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also acknowledged that this statement of YMCA before the Commission has been investigated outside of the “YMCA and he has found YMCA at the forefront of child safety” is also not accurate.
The Commission has evidence that YMCA was notified, and it obtained the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in Education and Community Department Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with the age of 21 years with YMCA, acknowledged that the management of “including myself” has failed due to appointing Lord, and failed to ensure that employees are clearly aware of their obligations related to informing child safety policy violations.
At the beginning of this year, Lord was convicted for sexual offenses with 12 children during the tenure of two years at YMCA.
He was given a penalty for minimum six years.
But Mr. Green refused to suggest that YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the employees did not notice child safety violations by Lord.
Given the evidence that the staff saw about the violation that the Lord spent time alone with children, making them privately babysitting, sitting in the lap, telling them that he loves them and involves playing them on his mobile phone.
Daniel Auckwell, who was under the supervision of Lord, and he was asked for child safety training, because he was worried about his behavior, testified that YMCA Caringbah Child Service Manager Jacie Barnat, who supervised Lord was “hard to get very bang and most of the time.”
C.E.O. said he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable with informing them above their manager.
He said, but his friendship with Lord misleaded his decision to inform him about him.
Mr. Green said he had given his approach to the YMCA NSW circle that, the text for the organization from the “Jonathan Lord Event” was “about not to inform”.
Mr. Green said that the decision to sign the privacy agreement by the employees immediately after the allegation came out, the child service of YMCA was carried out by the Managinger William Whiteley.
He said that it was aimed at refraining from the blending of evidence, but it was not executed in the “excitation” and correctly.
The University of Griffith’s Child Sexual Exploitation Special Professor Stephen Schalbon said that while staying on the work of Jonathan Lord between 2099 and 2011, YMCA NSW was not a safe organization.
He said that the staff had “every problems” in appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision.
Hearing has been postponed for 20 December.
Silver of Ponbrokers due to difficulty felt by the middle class in Singapore
The Bendemyer shopping centre in Singapore is taking cash by giving her gold bangle, ring and earrings to pay her daughter’s school fee.
“My husband and me have recently bought home,” said Mrs. Richthlinga, so all our money is stuck in it. ""
They say, although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 US dollars) as administrators, and their husbands also work, but the monthly income of the family remains insufficient.
In fact, parts of South-East Asia have the same demand - where domestic loans are increasing - Valuemax where they are doing their transactions, this week became the third ponshop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange.
Jewelry is not the only way to get cash - 1,300 Singapore Dollar in case of Ms. Richthlinga – but also as cheap as almost unsecured bank loans.
Usually Poonbroker in Singapore takes interest of 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than 15.4 per cent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender whose same shopping centre has a branch.
However, Poonbrokers have the benefit of not requiring credit checks or proof of salary, and they can provide more fast loans than the bank.
Millions of people are looking for Ponshop due to the increasing expenses of life and the increase in domestic and consumer loans by families.
After five years of strong growth after global financial disaster, and due to the simple monetary policy in developed economies, the following and middle-income families are striving to fulfill their needs due to the slowdown of their economy.
This week the rating agency, Standards Anj Puerce, mainly pointed out the risk factor for the loan of Asian banks, increasing domestic gains due to increased mortgage (mortage).
It said that Asia has the highest domestic loan in the ratio of Gross Domestic Product in Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.
Malaysia is ranked supreme in this list with 80 percent of GDP, while it was 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about the high levels of consumer loans in Thailand, which this week is lighter than technology slow.
On Thursday, the data showed a reduction in sustainable export slowdown and consumer demand.
“The deciding point is that with increasing prices, people coming from the medium to low class will try to increase their income in every conviction way,” said the Economist Song Wun in Malaysian Bank, CIMB. ""
Historically high values in gold values over the last two years have inspired people to pledge personal assets, as they are leveraging the opportunity to capitalize on the value of their family jewellery.
70 percent of items laid down in the 200 Poon outlet of City-State in Singapore are gold.
People are saying “The sense of sleeping looks good, let’s keep the gold chain of the grandma, and take back next month.
Thailand’s largest Ponshop operator, Ezymany, has witnessed 20 percent increase in the number of customers using their outlets in recent months.
There is such an increase in pledge business that 15 others such as the operator Valuemax of the outlet in Bendymire and Singapore, not only in their neighbourhood, plans to expand in Malaysia where there are four shops, but also plans to expand outside Asia, the executive director of Valuemax, Yah Lee Ching, says.
The company will finance it, with 60 percent use of 66 million Singapore dollars received in this week listing on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some dismount lenders have been criticized due to higher interest rates, Ms. Yah says that keeping a pledge doesn’t only get cheaper rates than other lenders, but it doesn’t directly increase debt.
“Customers pledge items that they have already had, and redeeming individual liquids does not increase home loans.
Social acceptance of Poonbroking is increasing to achieve short-term and secure financial assistance.
It is not that Poonbrokers use only financially vulnerable individuals.
The wealthy individuals in Singapore also use the Valuemax outlet, they pledge gold bars or Rolex clocks to get cash payments up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers of all sections of society.
Ms. Yah says, “This includes wealthy individuals who need a loan for a short time for business venture or investment, or small businesses that need to fulfill their cash flow requirements. ""
Sometimes they need funds in a very short time.
From pots in the capital on Dhanteras, people bought gold and silver.
In such purchases, 20 to 30 per cent is expected.
In Shimla, longs have been found in jewellery shops.
From the lower market to the Malrode, the pottery stores also saw a huge crowd.
However, this year, the inflation of the inflation on such items was taken, but the people still have not seen the inflation in the purchase of auspicious multi-art.
Auspicious stamp for purchase on Friday from 7:52 am to 10:12 pm and from 1:56 am to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm.
The more crowd of people in suburbs, including Shimla at the time of the said three Muhurt, sultry for more purchase.
In the Shimla Lower market, people don’t find the location to beat the foot.
Every small large store has crowded.
In such a way when shopping on the Dhanteras, celebrated as Triodashi Dhantriyodshi, Krishna Paksha, Kartik Mas, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
According to information, weeds were going towards an urban willow nursery called Habibula Malla in Haritara-Sopor.
Suddenly attacked a bear on it.

As long as the people from around for his help reach the spot, the bear had badly eaten his face.
The people took the stone on the bear.
On this he left the Habibula in the nursery hidden.
The villagers took the hospital for treatment of wounded bibulla.
$325 million rescue package for Taji’s health
The Union government has stressed that there are harsh conditions associated with the defence package of $325 million for the health system being sick of Tasmania which will ensure that the state government cannot afford the fund.
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibarsek announced that the state of the Commonwealth, the old population of the island, the high rate of chronic diseases, and the limitations of the system are “time action” to address the existing crisis.
The decision of funding to be made during four years was followed by the consultation of the government with the independent MP Andrew Wilki of Tasmania.
Ms. Plibarsek today said, “The government brings emergency rescue packages, about which we believe it will address the challenges faced by the state.
The package of $325 million also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgery, will assist in addressing previous aggregated cases.
It also includes funds for walk-in clinic, better care after visiting the hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and personal electronic health records system in local hospitals.
“These investments are consistent with the best ways I’ve stated to improve the health system of Tasmania by leading practitioners. ""
The Minister insisted that the Government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State has to maintain the current financing level to achieve the Commonwealth Fund, and report each month where additional funds are being spent.
Commission of three members will be formed to ensure the service is provided as effective and efficient as possible by the state.
“Unless real improvements are made to deliver the public health system of Tasmania to a more vascular level,” said Shri Wilki. ""
Yet he admired the government to respond to his request for immediate assistance, which they first brought to the Prime Minister in early May. ""
“I hope that the federal support package will prove to be very helpful in the direction of separating the state re-public health system from a distressed list,” said Mr. Wilki. ""
According to the State Government, these additional alternative processes will predominate mainly the recent challenges.
But the federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dattan believes today’s announcement is “band-ed solution. ""
“We are here for the reason why the Labour State Government has taken $430 million in its health system.
You can’t assume the day of good news to be taken by the State Government about half a billion dollars and given $300 million by the Commonwealth.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibarsek should give a guarantee that one of the rescue packages will not be spent on extra bureaucracy.
Promote corporate fear from NSA’s revelation about state surveillance.
Late on a cool day in August, a German police chopper was banned on the US Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
On the direction of office (BfV) to protect the Constitution, the domestic intelligence agency of Germany, was the mission to take a picture of the roof of America’s quartet, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and Bundisbnk.
German media asked BfV to recognize the presence of Licing Antennas and indicated an exchange action between the German Ministry of External Affairs in the US and Berlin. .
James Claper, director of American national intelligence emphasized the US of its foreign intelligence capabilities " To steal business secrets of foreign companies and increase their international competitiveness to American companies or increase their bottom line." Then do not use in September.
But since Edward Snowdon, a contractor who remains a whistleblower began to tell the treasure of his mystery to American surveillance, the European government and the business world leader are no longer sure that the director does not follow his word.
The U.S. national security agency spyed on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed fear about state monitoring.
The last thing came when it turned out that the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then certainly the leaders of the business world are also targeting the potential.
Snowdon has made intense cooperation transparent between U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit.
“Germany should be waived” says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, representing German IT companies of small and medium size.
According to a survey published in July by the Consultancy of German companies, the U.S. has become a major risk almost now, such as China, when it comes to industrial spying and data theft.
All documentation leaked by Mr. Snowdon, however, there is no evidence that the U.S. go to the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
The politicians have expressed the lack of the European Union’s internet capabilities. And it should try to reduce its dependence on the US.
The leaders of the business world are doubting about this.
In the German Parliament someone said we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gently open them again. ..
“It’s no way,” said Haso Plotner, the president of the German business software company SAP,.
If a strong European IT industry wanted, then he didn’t die 20 years ago.
Everything is discounted in Germany. From coal to car, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
Exposed by Snowdon about American technical sophistication and spying access have proved as a trauma to some companies who previously believed the biggest monitoring threats are China
Getting a big change In the cloud computing sixth where the European officer is more aware that the data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore have become potential sensitive.
Some 10 per cent non-US members canceled plans to use an American based cloud provider after the data prism mining program opens out by a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a business institution.
Jim Snabe, CEO of SAP says: " We saw a new question that customers did not come a year ago – Is it stored? And can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction? ""
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and this should be timed at every price on them.
It is not a surprise that economic spying occurs.
It is always.
“It’s a theme for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing changed” says Kirt Bock, the chief executive of the chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level and we also do, because it is in national interest to defend our business
Corporate leaders are generally not interested in the defence system and are an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, having a lot of time message record Whether it’s unpretentious to leave a home business with a USB stick, or a laptop is unhappy to leave a hotel room at least to say.
Ulrich Hackenberg, Car Maker Audi, says the board member of it's a year old system The use of mobile phones before board meetings is not as remote listening devices
Germany’s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to exposure on overseas rounds.
Prepaid mobile phones were then thrown later.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a concern.
In Germany, this many vibrancy is aval in the global market in particular place.
“Small and medium-sized vibrancy often lack of experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” BfV warns in a report.
U.S. has warned about economic spying of its own companies by other countries.
According to the France The Washington Post, the name of the US National Intelligence in February, named behind China with Russia and Israel in a second Tier of criminals enclosed in hacking for economic intelligence, which economic intelligence.
“French is the worst when it comes to economic spying, according to the board member of a German blue chip company
Bernard Squarcini French Internal Intelligence Agency DCRI, former head of, explains in the interview: “All countries of services know well even if they give together in the non-perror battle, spying on their partners. ""
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level and we also do, because it is in national interest to defend our business

Despair of Obama Voters
I voted for Obama twice as much as possible
He says that the great efforts of Obama have been disrupted due to the policy of resistance to GOP
Blockage Policy Obamacare website failures, drone attacks cannot shed
The 2008 campus of the Obama year reminds what could be
Nathenal P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books nowadays.
This is a book that I think it will make me zeal during the second year medical school’s vivid and ray hoped in me.
It is the name of the “Geople’s Dare” and is the founder of Barack Obama’s Presidential Election Campaign 2008.
When I get punished with my patients at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a round where politics had inspired millions of people and the speech could prevent your breath.
The elections were proved to be single, and the news speakers had taken a break to reflect the historical importance of that time.
My classmates had joy in the eyes, and my parents saved every meeting newspaper.
A team of young people who had been visiting the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had 82 per cent approval rating when he became the President of Obama in 2008.
And then I stopped the book.
The truth of the present is a rigorous truth, such as returning from the world of dreams.
It is hard to remember those days of expectation - they seem to be a distant memories, a sad miss of lost opportunities.
After the first time I voted, I really changed.
In a simple way, you can’t imagine any of it.
I attribute Obama a lot of achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the return of our army from Eraq, until the Osama Bin Laden is killed by the expiry of “Not to Ask”.
In addition, I believe that the policy of opposing the bias has prevented a lot of efforts to proceed to our country: including immigrant reforms, public options for healthcare, stopping the eggs on the Guwantanamo Bay, and others.
But in a number of times in which I favored myself the Obama administration before colleagues and colleagues, I end up with the answer that I could give them.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican’s protest policy is not an answer to the spying of foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It may not respond to the collection of data about the private life of common American citizens by National Security Agency nor respond to the government’s misrepresentation on people exposed.
It may not cause the murder of Anwar L. Avalaki without any trial, nor the public funds and expenditure limitations that are lower during the President’s campaign.
It may not answer the findings of the report, which says the attempts to steal the Midi by the White House are the most aggressive ever since the “Nixon administration. ""
And most recently, the Affordable Care Act cannot shed the failure of designing a simple website even after three years of being signed in the law.
I don’t know what I expected it.
If, at the age of 18, I had to guess that the governance system could contradict the political campaign that brought it forward.
Directly that the elected office is not a prerequisite route, as anti-political parties and random events such as the Newtown Killer, will shape our public discussion.
Yet the examples I’ve given above are most likely to be chosen by the administration itself.
This is the most annoying thing to do.
I revived in 2012 for Obama, but not so I was thrilled by his candidacy.
MIT Romani presented a confusing and an uncertain option that did not seem like determining their policies or their posts.
I thought that a second term for Obama, which will be free from the pressure of the future elections, will fulfill the hopes we have been hearing about for a long time.
Yet, while Obama’s resonance rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very hard to return to 2008 through that book.
I remember the promises that have disappeared from him.
In this week a part of the book was reading, which was described in what way Pennsylvania had a huge loss of clon due to Obama in the primary.
In a post-martum campaign meeting, he spoke to his subordinate staff that they need to return back to Patri, and to remain honest on their objectives.
He said "I want to get back to my Mojo".
We must remember who we are. ’
After five years, I cannot agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are the nathanial Morris.
The monitoring group said Syria has destroyed its ability to create chemical weapons
The group monitoring Thursday said that Syria has destroyed important equipment to create chemical weapons and poisonous gas war materials, while the northern part of Syria emerged as a struggle that is very close to the place where toxic agents are considered to be placed.
As well as on Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group has said that about three years ago, about 120,000 people have been killed from the beginning of the Syrian Civil War.
This announcement of Chemical Weapon Prohibition Organization has occurred a day before the last date of November 1
The Hague-based organization set Duskas to destroy machinery used for mixing chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and filling in war materials or “ineffective”.
Completed the initial stage of destruction mainly, this ambitious developments have a meaningful milestone aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Dumuscus by the mid-19.
Dismantle equipment means Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, the weapons and collections present to Duskas are still destroyed.
Syria is believed to have just 1000 MT of chemicals and weapons, including Mustard Gas and Nerve Agent Sarin.
The UK position Syrian Observatory for Human Rights has reported that this announcement took place at the time when the struggle increased in the city of Safira on Thursday, experts believe that it is the storage center as well as the chemical weapon production unit.
The movement group having a description of the number of dead through the network of movement in Syria said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
She said that it includes 61,067 common citizens, including 6,365 children.
On behalf of the government, it is said that 29,954 President Bashar is a member of the military army of Asad, 18,678 are fighters fighting in favor of the government and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah is extremist.
It also said that in the dead there are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of which are foreign.
On July 25, the UN estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the struggles that have gone from March 2011.
It did not update the data since then.
About 20 lakh people have been oversized to leave the country due to this conflict.
Asad’s military team was warping with rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of which were related to al-Qaida groups.
On Thursday the Observatory said that people have been casual on both sides, but not clearly said anything.
This war reflects the danger faced by the inspectors of chemical weapons, which have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war, in a very short time-frame.
The statement on the O.P.C.W. working together with the United Nations stated that its team is “still satisfied and has confirmed – and all the declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment of Syria – have been destroyed. ""
“Therefore no inspection activity being planned.” ""
At the beginning of this week, the inspectors said that they have completed the first stage of confirmation work by visiting 21 centres of 23 centres declared by Duskas.
The inspectors said they were not able to go to two centres for security reasons.
On Friday, O.P.C.W. said that these two centres have been “terrorized” according to Syria and... The chemical weapons placed there were products items delivered to other declared centers, which have been inspected. ""
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of those two centres, where it was not able to be inspected by the OPCW.
Syria has presented plans for the entire destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be sanctioned by the Executive Committee of O.P.C.W. next month.
“In order to complete the most challenging mission by this organization so far, I salute the perseverance displayed by the people and Hausley. ""
For three years, this Civil War is mainly the government of Asad and its security forces, which came out of Shia Islam, including members of this cult, and the rebel is the struggle between Sunni Muslims.
In other events, Ramy Abdurahman, head of the Observatory, said that the coastal region of Syria was strongly exploded on Wednesday at the Air Defense Centre in Addictaria.
He said that the cause of this explosion is not yet known.
The economic lawsuit is filed on Google, Ssang, Huawei in case of Nortel Petent.
A group owned by thousands of former Nortel Petent has filed a lot of patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone makers on Thursday, which had laid down in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Union named Rockstar who purchased the Nortel Petrents in 4.5 billion has sued the Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for Petent Violations in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Erection and Sony.
Google is accused of violating the seven patents above.
It was said that these patents also include technology that combines the words that are searched on the Internet with consistent advertising, which is the main part of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted instantly.
Samsung, Huawi, and HTC make all of these phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which are combated by Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google had launched $900 million for Nortel Petants.
Google proposed $4.4 billion to eventually increase the bid several times.
After losing from the rockstar in Nortel Petants, Google bought Motorola Mobility in $12.5 billion, a major reason for Motorola had to have an elongated list of patents.
“In spite of defeating the Petants-in-Suit in Nilami, Google has violated, and is constantly violating”
Rockstar has demanded increased compensation against Google, as it claims that the violation of the patents by Google is incomplete.
F.A.A.: Aeration vehicles can now use gadgets in aeration (but can’t call cell phones)
Aircraft passengers will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music, from entering the gate to descend from the gate - But it’s not possible to talk to your cellphone – This is under the highly predicted new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes instantly.
Michael Huerta, administrator of the FAA at a news conference, said how fast these changes are implemented, it will vary in each airline.
Airlines have to demonstrate how their aircraft meet new guidelines, and how the rules are updated to store their crew members and devices to reflect guidelines.
F.A.A. said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already presented plans.
“Based on the status of the project, we can quickly approve the extended use of the electronic device,” F.A. said in a statement.
At the moment, passengers need to close their smartphones, tweezers, and other devices when the air is closed.
They are expected to reach the height of 10,000 feet of the aircraft and do not turn them on until they are allowed by Captain.
Travelers are expected to re-close their device when they land the plane, and do not turn it until the aircraft is completely descended.
F.A. said, Under new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic disruption can allow their passengers to fly by plane, when landing the aircraft and use the device at the time of taxiing.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at greater altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Chairman of Association of Professional Flight Attendant, Laura Gliding has welcomed these changes.
Gladding said in a statement, "When the policy will be implemented safely - and we will work together with airlines companies to do so - it will be a win-win thing for both sides. ""
When it comes to this issue, we’ve been bored as “Hall Monitors”.
Agency said that but surfing, email sharing, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be restricted by connecting the Internet at a height less than 10,000 feet.
Travelers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tweezers and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no interaction with friends, online games like Scrubble, the well-known event that Ekter Alek Baldwin in 2011, was playing on his smartphone while staying a plane park at the door, and the American Airlines had unloaded them from the plane when they refused to close the device.
And heavier tools like laptops etc will still have to be stored as they are likely to hurt the other person in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will continue to remain restricted during flight.
The regulatory rights related to phone calls are to the Federal Communications Commission, not near the FAA.
The FAA may remove restrictions on some electronic devices during the flight and landing of the aircraft.
Mark Roxencan of National Transport Security Board last month, which is the National Transport Security Expert of CBS News, said that cell phones are still considered risk.
“Cell phones are really serious issues, not just because they can potentially generate disruptions in navigation-related devices, but also because they can generate disruptions in cell phone towers when they are in the air.
The Industry World Consulting Committee constituted by FAA to examine the issue has recommended that the government should allow more use of individual electronic devices.
The pressure on FAA is increasing in recent years to reduce restrictions from their use.
Sen. Critics like Claire McCaskiller, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
Enforcement of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the device is using the surveyor.
Some studies also indicate that about thirds of the passengers forget or ignore the instructions for closing their device.
The FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers in the year 1996, when passengers had received a report of disruption in navigation and communication devices due to carrying a high-tech gadget of FM radio and that time.
New airlines are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of companies, aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by FAA to have resistance to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi usage at the cruise height from passengers for several years.
The modified aircraft for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huerta said that most airlines companies should descend to eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under new guidelines.
Today’s time electronic devices emit radio transmission of much less power than the previous generation electronic device.
E-readers, for example, have a total nominal transmission during page rebound.
But the transmission prevails when downloading or sending data by the device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favor to reduce restrictions on device usage by passengers.
In the year 2011, the company’s officers loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in airlines and flew them to test problems but no problem found.
The FAA Advisory Committee on Risk of Use of the Device has expressed his/her emotions.
The Douglas Kid of the National Aeration Passenger Union said he believes that the disruption of the device is real, whether the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that, there are only reports described by the pilot in support of being disrupted by the device in the aircraft system, most of which are too old.
However, the members of the committee recommended that the FAA pilot would allow the passengers to shut down the device at the time of airing in low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and is called the general knowledge facility of people travelling in the latest round of technology.
The C.E.O. Roger Do of the U.S. Travel Association said we are glad that the FAA has identified that the passenger traveling with joy is not incompatible with rescue and security.

The Vidyalayas have taken more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the courses of English literature, students have to read at least a drama of Shakespeare, a 19th century novel, romantic poem, and the symmetrical British story after 1914.
The examination will also include “not seen text” to encourage greater reading.
A joint English literature and language course will be eliminated.
Students from the year 2015 have to take a separate GCSE in the language, and a lot of induction to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will issue new courses for English and Mathematics tomorrow – both of them will be the first topics that will have a revolutionary change.
This will also change the second main topics next year.
In a separate step, the examination regulator will display the changes in the structure of GCSE with the off-call, new grading system, and lower course.
Speaking in the summer, the Secretary of Education Michael Gov said that “There was a lot of consensus about that, we need to improve the upcoming examination system to preserve the trust of people,” he said that “GCE will be “more challenging, more equitable and more rigorous”.
Studies found that English schools devote less time in mathematics - 3 hours a week less than 116 hours a year or - most countries during the session.
According to the comparison Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there is no formal requirement to give more time to math, alliance sources said that comprehensive maths were likely to encourage the students to provide additional teaching in schools by being combined with subjects in GCSE - league table.

Large orders of jet manufacturers from dispute for seat width at stake.
This month’s Dubai Aurango has been set up a rhythm for quarrels Among leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of the tourist-class seats for long distance flights
The controversy focuses on the width of the seat of the Economie class in long flights, as not always given by the Erelines but the allotted location efficiency is claimed to be the key by the Latest Jet Erbus SAS and the Boang Company. .
Erbus is expected to give a wide seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the eConomie Cabbin this week but it should be fixed by the erlines to say its main-competitive Boeing.
The dispute comes between the aircraft producers when a large version of the twin engine of the long-distance Ercraft from the potentially recorded order after the 17-21 event.
How is the previous department of the aircraft created- In particular whether seating is 9 or 10 equal. The design of mini jumbo jets is being prepared taking into account the Davo of greater capacity?
Boeing says it’s built “777 X” that will keep 406 people in 17 inches wide and 10 logos in a row in anemic department.
Airbus says it will take 350 people in an equal seat left 18 inches while hitting with A350.
Aircraft giants often trade on technical matters through advertising in trade press.
Now, with Airbus 777 X Dubai is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Arsso, so further appealing to the public.
Recently it is being seen that the beginning of the wigness war has been something. Is it possible for Finsero to accept it together in a restaurant, showing it?
Airbus Sales head John Lehi said “Boing is presenting long distance flight in hybrids even from regional turbo”.
As a change, people are getting bigger, but the plane is not changed.
According to American Health Department statistics between the 1970s when Boeing 747 jumbo ne modern long ki travel ko defined tha, and ant of the century me average 40 - 49-year-old American male ke weight increased by 10 percent.
The average American male waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to American health statistics.
Airbus says its opponent is glued to a seat concept of 1950 when the average perimeter of the new name "Jet Set" was narrow.
Airbus says they have established research commissions that suggest an additional inch 53 per cent of sleep quality improvement in the seat width.
Boeing disputed the statistics of Airbus’s seat measurement, and said it is not dependent on the decision of the manufacturers of how airlines balance between rent and facilities. .
It also says the research of shows depends on the experience of the cabin over the width of a seat.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Kraver said. “This really explains the flexibility to airlines and the things that they need to do to succeed. ""
“They don’t want to tell us what they have to benefit.”
They know their business better than anyone else.
This elbow for flyers is about the room, but for suppliers it is increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The trade of at least 700 billion dollars behind this dispute is the style of plane order’s event is sufficient, in the coming decades to tip US and European export scales.
Reuters reported that for the first time in July, whether the seat layout is actually the battle issue between new jet aircraft.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 percent of the workforce per seat has occurred in their new twin-engine design of the leader of that section, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Er.
Boeing’s performance claims dependent on comparison with 777 design with 10 x One Original 9.
10 equals with profit in unit cost now use the comparison.
Kevin Kinstein, the head of Europe’s Airbus passenger facility says “This of Boeing is doing to capture more seats to make their aircraft more competitive with our products,”.
On the other hand, analysts say that the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the existing 777S suggests that many passengers are in favor of the Densar layout, which can go along with cheap rent. .
The cabin insider expert said the runway girl network of my curby, founder and editor" eighteen inch seat width will be great for travelers, but the reality is that this business point of airbus is driven by the threatening the offer 777"
Airbus and Boeing seats are not supplied but providing a list for airlines to choose from suppliers.
Jet sellers from all over the world also take careful measures to check on this layout event.
More relaxing, all builders are also offering high-density layouts for low-cost aircraft services and regional travel of jet aircraft.
Airbus giving a 10 equal A350 but say it is not sold right now.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized extensive cabin seats on some of its jets for more cabin facility needs.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturer, but it can distract from 777 X sales wave.

premature puberty: quickly grown
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls get puberty at an early age than their age blonde girls.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is right
There are no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals may be defected
Experts believe that a physical outbreak may be a cause of puberty at an early age
The case of puberty before time is not as effective as in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheriz is a specialist journalist in children’s health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried, if his daughter starts developing tits at the age of 7 or 8 and getting genital hair?
Dr Paul Caplovitz, a pediatric endocrinologist at the annual conference of the American Pediatric Academy in Orlando, Florida, clarified that these early physical changes are common in American girls, reflecting the new trend.
“I spend a lot of time giving the guardians trust – that it usually doesn’t show the quick progress towards the full puberty. ""
The direct symptoms of development such as germination of tits, genital and lumbar hair and physical odor are seen prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades there has been a very slight change in the age of Rhozdarshan (First Monthly-Dharm).
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, which was 12.75 in the year 1970.
“It takes at least two to three years in the first ruzodarshan when the tits begin to grow” explains Caplovitz, which is also the author of “premature puberty in girls: the guide needed to deal with this common problem.”
Yaovan has the most accurate testing time of development.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when there is an increase with the development of the tits before the age of 8, two call it "hair-ready".
In most cases, the procedure will slow down or stop - the pediatrician can observe closely.
In the event of more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may need to be examined so as to overcome the possibilities of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences are: premature aging of the bone, which can lead to undeveloped growth and slogan as an adult.
Drugs or hormones depend on recommendations for treatment, child age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are adorned with medications but accepts, "The suppression of the eyebrow can increase the behavioral issue, and girls may begin to feel different from their peers. ""
The second major problem can be understood: Parents don’t just want their younger daughter to be monthly.
“They worry about the risk of the womb,” said Caplovitz, or how they will maintain hygiene. ""
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruation at the age of 10 years, remembers, "It was shock. ’
Although there were signs of this and we had talked about the menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
He was afraid of his school and returned to trouble that he had started the first menstruation in his fellows.
There are a lot of well-established principles about the causes of untimely puberty.
Yet, there is no continuing evidence that hormones in milk or other food-neededs, chemicals in the environment or sexually in the media may be accused.
Boys are also - girls like the same - premature puberty.
Caplovites determine the rule that the most main cause of this is the outbreak of the macroeconomic.
He had assisted in conducting studies over 6 to 9 years of girls in the year 2001, which combines body fat with puberty time.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that contribute to it.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls have a tendency to get puberty before their age blonde girls.
There are a lot of explanations.
Globally, premature puberty appears to be influenced by all things, from economic conditions to weather and jeans.
Other puzzles: Although the boys are receiving face and genital hair at an early age, the running of puberty is not as clear as girls in them.
Other practitioners attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even the hair of acne and genitals in babies and children has become common.
“We need to be careful about how we recognize the real starting of puberty. ""
Parents should not hesitate to take guidance from your pediatrician to take an opinion about how to talk to your children.
“It may mean to interact before the expected time. ""
If you’re calm, your child will normally answer properly.
Girls who have premature development need to be confident that even if it is premature but it is part of normal life.

Arroast on the punishment of the bomb plot in the Bali
The 202 people who were killed in bomb threats in 2002, cited on the punishment given to the bomb blast plot, saying that Umar Ptech should face the firing team.
Ptech, which ran as one of the most desired individuals from South-East Asia for about 10 years, was sentenced yesterday 20 years for his role in building the explosive device used in bomb blast.
It can be released in 15 years when the parole is given.
The 45-year-old Omar was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the well-known tourist area of Kuta, with 202 people killed, including 88 Australians, and a lot of people were injured.
He was also convicted in other allegations related to terrorism in which the eve of Christmas in the year 2000 was held in Indonesia Includes chained bomb blast.
The prosecutors demanded the punishment of life imprisonment, although they could also demand that the death of this person called the notorious “divulging person” as a bomber master.
The decision replenished the painful memories of the female Jun Cortin living in Perth, who lost their 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack carried out by Ptech and his co-organists a decade ago.
By preventing his tears, he said Ptech had to be deathd.
I really feel that he had to find other peghar terrorists as well.

Shri Hughes says that Patek had to get the same sentence which was responsible for this genocide, three other members of the Jammah Islamiah Terrorist Dal – Amarogi, Mukhalus and Imam Sea – who was deathd four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given deaths before someone else.
There is no reason to keep her liberation, to see her liberation.
It is not enough to get 20 years of punishment after killing 202 people and awakening a number of people.
Ptech is the last person to be decorated with Bali bomb explosives.
He was saved from being caught for about a decade, but eventually in January 2011, Pakistan was arrested in Abtabad, where the U.S. Army had killed former Alkaida chief Osama Bin Laden after less than four months.

Shri Big assaulted Cocaine’s accustomed lawyer about police investigation
42-year-old Bashrat Dita Kakhyaat was reported to the offender Neil Scarboro
Advocate found that people may find out about his confidential drug addiction
Her Liverpool Crown Court Punished Three Year Prison
To the top lawyer of the defending party, who told Shri Big about the main police investigation, because he was afraid of his intoxication will be revealed to people about his secret addiction to the drug, there is a three-year imprisonment.
The 42-year-old Brashitta provided sensitive confidential information about the investigation of his drug trafficking activities, after compromising his cocaine addiction.
The advocate, which was nicknamed “Bash”, and was praised by the criminals as “Top Brief,” was arrested from his house in the year 2011 after police surveillance operations in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics trial.
The authorities saw 32-year-old Scarborough having three bags of Cocaine in the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lankashire, while he went out for the Law Society Dinner with his colleagues.
After receipt of cocaine particles in Dita’s hair, his wallet, and his credit card, the doctor showed that the drug was “regular users” of the Dita A category.
During the eight-month period between January to August 2011, he attempted to get illegal information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his colleague.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police at that time as part of the heroine and cocaine gang operating in Lancashire, Kumbria, Merceside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other persons who were sent a prison after the police had seized 1.5 million pounds worth heroine and cocaine, and more than 200,000 pounds cash during multiple impressions.
The 42-year-old Dita provided information to the offenders, as he was afraid that people do not know about his cocaine addiction.
In Blackbird, the situation was facing up in the Liverpool Crown Court today after being convicted in two cases of interrupting the route of justice after the trial lasted three weeks in the firm Forbes Solicitors.
He had accepted about placing cocaine in the first hearing.
The bad time of the lawyer began at that time When scrutinizing Scarborough, the police found that he was in touch on the phone regularly with Detta from February 2011.
Two detectives followed suspicious and looked at him in the house of Detta and taking a drug of more than 60 percent purity under the bin of the lawyer at the Black Golf Gloves.
After the drug has been placed, Scarborough was regularly contacted with the detox, which went out for dinner at the Blackner Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
At home, the lawyer showed that there was a drug intoxication and had been communicated nine times between them.
The court was hearing that he was found a “regular user” of the cocaine in the test when he found a range of drug clues on Dita’s hair, wallets and credit cards.
Detta was arrested later, but refused to use Cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer, because he was his client and said that his discussion was the subject of “legislative privilege.”
During his arrest, Detta tried to remove a lot of credit cards, but he was seized, and his hair was sampled.
In the police interview, he said that he had walked office with his work-stable as well as his house, and his clients call his house for legal matters.
After the arrested by the main persons telling what the spy knew about them, the court was said in hearing that the doctor called the chiefs of the drug supply chain, some of which he had presented earlier.
Annie White on behalf of the prosecution said: “The patient advocate should know the best about not breaking the law. ""
Shri Ditta is accused of misusing his post as a criminal advocate, connecting much more with his specific client.
We are not talking about the general drug dealer’s relationship, but not about the dealer who is providing drug intoxication to our lawyer.
Some of their interactions will certainly be legalized without any doubt, as he was the lawyer.
But he went beyond his limits of lawyer-client relationship.
As much as possible he interrupted the police investigation so that they remain able to continue their criminal activities.
Shri Ditta was not honoring his profession but humiliation.
He made a lot of closes from certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and he allowed the agreement with his freedom.
Detta refused any wrong act and claimed that: “If I have corrupted lawyers, I am not, and if I want to provide information to Mr. Scarboro, I don’t wait for 15 hours, but I immediately work.
But after hearing Lankashire police’s superintendent Lee Helsted said: “Shri Dettta started receiving drug from organized criminals at the same time he converted himself from criminal advocate to criminal. ""
His cocaine addiction causes he highly compromised and became very vulnerable to the objectives of the leading members of the organized crime groups who used him to obtain important information regarding police investigation.
The advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and fill trust and confidence in people.
Shri Ditta has cheated with this belief and attempted to escape his profession.
The Severe and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire investigated Shri Dettta, which also found guilty of three events to keep them cocaine and now impede the way of justice, which demonstrates our commitment to bringing offenders to the Court.
The case should work the warning for the offenders that no person is away from the access of the law.
We will take you the search and submit before the court.
14 years of imprisonment was given to Scarborough to supply heroine, cocaine and cannabis.
The maneuver included in the gang was sent imprisonment for a total of 153 years for drug crimes to other members.
Detta on his website gave questions and answers sessions about him, in which he said his fantasie will be Job Being a lawyer for a client with death penalty in the U.S., Mohammed Ali’s dinner is a guest and inequality to be inspiration for his work.
Drop in the profits of Bombardier as the delivery of aircraft, deterioration of orders
Canada’s Airplane and Train Maker Bombardier Inc reported a decline of 15 per cent in net profit on Thursday, as pressured by airplane order and delivery from it on contract issues in the third quarter in its train unit.
Montreal based Bombardier also did not present an update on issues to release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or aircraft will complete its ambitious program of going to commercial service from next September.
After the first flight of the test plane followed by another half months ago, it is just three times blown, picking up the question whether the test phase is on the track.
The result fell less than the forecast and the stock is sent for sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst share with the National Bank Financial reduced its rating from Thursday to “field performance” Stock is limited to the next one or two quarters above.
“Commere aircraft delivery were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by margin performance in transport,” said Dorsen in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of flight test program.
However, if any new orders are not announced in the coming months, doubt that the market will be skeptical of the program.
Bombardier expects the aircraft family can now cut it at the low end of the boeing and airbus dominated market.
The first test plane was unveiled in March and was flying for the first time in September after the month of delay.
Potential Buyer waits for the results of flight testing to validate company claims regarding new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as medium for CSeries up to 177 Pakka Order.
403 whole order and commitment is available with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident to Bombardier will meet its 300 firm order goal from the time to bring in the first jet commercial use.
The authorities were running according to the schedule that the analysts and the media assured on Thursday.
“The testing aircraft had stayed on the land for a long time than the forecasted,” Boudoin said in a conference call, adding it to the ground test and software updates scheduled during the plane’s interlock.
Every manufacturer makes schedules in a different way.
We decided to do a first flight and an updated period and said what we have done.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second remaining portion of five test planes is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after a while, the company said
Yet, analysts are suspected Customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier said that it was evaluated the service (EIS) schedule in admission and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow speed of flight test - although in line with the internal schedule of Bombardier - illustrates our idea that the service in question will be pushed to Q1/15," said Dorsen.
For the third quarter ended September 30, the net profit of Bombardier a year ago $ $147Million, or 8 cents per share, $172Million, or fell to 9 cents per share.
Adjusted income per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
$4.2 billion 4.1 billion minor dipped.
According to the Analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 per share was expected to receive revenues of St. and $4.56 billion.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said that below 57 a year ago, 45 aircraft were replenished during the quarter
The net order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Backlog in the Aerospace Division was $32.9 billion on September 30, no change from December 31.
“Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment,” said Boudoin.
A decline of 13 per cent in Aerospace Revenue $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world’s largest train producer, revenue in the division had increased by about 11 percent for $2.1 billion.
Orders in the transport unit were backlog $32.6 billion approx 30 September, above modest from December 31.
Some large contracts in the margin of the Transport Division were also affected by the issues of execution.
Executives said that new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
In Bombardier’s shares, which announced the inclusion of Google Inc’s Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pitchet Board, also in mid-day business on Thursday were 8.5 percent below C$ 4.83.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third largest business aircraft manufacturer and the closest rival of Bombardier, reported a decline of 10 percent in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Parents of Internet Kids can choose their children’s ‘Ling Undefined’
Germany has become the first country of European Union, which has recognized third sex for children born with vague genitals.
Now the newborns will not be specified in a stereotype manner.
Parents do not need to declare sex for such children as new law, this law allows them to declare ‘undefined’ or “unspecified” on the child’s birth certificate.
The purpose of new law is to reduce pressure above the parents who can take decisions regarding gender-specification surgery for newborns, and struggle against intersex children.
According to B.B.C. an intersex person said years later, “Not I am men, nor women. ""
I will continue to make sure that I have been made by doctors.
According to the estimate, a child from 2,000 children each year is the one who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 situations that come under investigation into the disorders of sexual development, is a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genitourinary (oval or test), or unusually developed sex.
Maybe Vallis Simpson is intersex.
Ling identity is still not understood properly, but most experts in the United States believe that when there is no gender-determination, it is better to use the best information present to specify the Ling and conduct surgery, if such a newborn, observe the psychological and physical development of the child before it comes to.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychologist of the New York City who specializes in the affairs of Ling-identification, said that the new law of Germany appears to be “good thing. ""
Intersex children create moral osmosis.
He said, “Some people are in a state like prana-shrink that requires surgery, but most children do not have this. ""
You can specify the sex without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of knowing how a child will develop is not very accurate.
No person can give a reasonable answer about why it happens.
This is a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
In the report filed before the European Commission in the year 2011, Intersex people have been described as different from transsexual or transgender people, because their condition is not related to sex but is related to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female but either joint form or none of the two are clearly defined.
These features can display the secondary sexual aptitudes themselves, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, tits and lengths; primary sexual aptitudes such as reproductive organs and genitals; or in chromosome structure and hormones.
The report also provides overview of the discriminations faced by intersex and transgender individuals in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and paralysis crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-compliant sex.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult individuals to mark male, female or “Third sex” on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norry May-Velbi became the world’s first accreditation-receipt “Lingless” person after winning the legal appeal made to keep life-perspective “Unspecified” Ling status.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the German passport will also have third specifications as X for Intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, the neighboring countries are still controversial with sex in France.
In 2011, dozens of French method-makers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to return the “Ling Principle” from school books.
The website of the U.S. Catholic online has also opposed this law of Germany, saying, “When the world is going to such a state where sex is the option to be chosen by itself, but not sexual activity, we are taking two more columns of civilization in the opposite direction. ""
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone that she would prefer to see children to be specified lingering at birth.
“The upbringinging is very stressful, especially if you don’t know what your child’s sex is. ""
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called Hermaphrodites (Ubhailingi), named after the beautiful Greek god who were bilingual.
And less than a few decades ago, the medical world considered Ling as a slate that could be erased and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that sex-identification is complex work, and sometimes there may be a mistake from physicians, who do not know what children will feel about their sex specifications when grown.
Dreshar says "In the middle of the XI century, it called "Monorog Emergency".
When these children were born, you did not call the psychiatrist, you called the surgical doctor.
The current principle regarding the treatment of children with obscure genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of the University of John Hapkins, who believed to be resusable to Ling.
He created the word "Ling identity" and argued that social and environmental signs - how parents upbring the child - Interacting with the gene and hormones of the child by determining that he is recognized as a male or as a woman.
But in a case of the year 1966, known as "John/Joan", his theory became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child who had been accidentally lingering during the Lingagcharm-Octoberation (Circumusition) to give the child a full ligament to his testicles and like his redden-Palan girl.
Dreshar said, “Many presented that matter as a successful case of the stage, but he did not happen. ""
At the age of 15, the child took back to himself as a male and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dreshar said that still some physicians are “following the same antagonism”.
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after the year 1990, individuals undergoing these sex surgery began to come to the front "not happy with the system".
The same case was with Montana’s 36-year-old author Jim Bruce, who was born with X.Y. male chromosomes, but his genitals was vague.
The physicians did not clearly understand that his sex was small, or his whistle was large, but they were certain that he could never live as a man "satisfied life".
So, after some time of his birth in 1976, the external organs of Bruce and the testicles were taken out by surgery and like his upbringinging girl.
She was given female hormones at age 12.
“I knew I’m not a girl,” she told ABCNews.com. ""
I was not happy but it was very hard to question.
At the age of 18, vaginoplasty had to be with him.
But feeling depressive and somewhat messy, she sought medical records.
This led him to fearful truth.
I was liberated at the time of birth – and someone never told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented her body from creating a sufficient amount of testosteron, due to which her genitals cannot develop appropriately.
After knowing the truth, he became a male back, he took the testosteron dosage and removed his tits.
He was infertile due to surgery.
Today, he explains how to normalize his perception of people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project.
But, the legal group of California-based Advocates for Informed Choice’s Executive Director Anne Tamar-Matics expressed concern that Germany’s law invites “Chippy and Calnk. ""
“Many activists think that Germany’s law will inspire parents to make quick decisions and specify the child “undefined”. ""
We fear that it will encourage intervention.
We think instead of waiting, it is better to specify male or female sex.
But we don’t know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Maticis said that his organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to be identified in third sex. ""
“The adults about legislative sex should be able to make their own decision. ""
Germany’s law is related to specifying it at birth.
It is not the rust that is fought by newborns at this time.
When you are older, they can take their body-related decisions.
But Pittsburgh’s tits radiologist Dr. Erlen Baratz whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said that Germany’s law will provide “power to both parents and children. ""
The daughter of Baratjei was born with Katy male chromosomes, but she was a DSD called full androgen dissensitivity syndrome.
Since his androgen was defected in the grahi, women in Katy evolved eccentrics.
The vaginal in his body is so but there is no uterine or ovarian.
Now the 29-year-old Katy is married and is resident in the Department of Child Psychology at Pennsylvania University.
Though he is a hamper, he expects to be a mother through adoption or a Gestian surrogacy.
“This law facilitates parents to take no decisions on their own in a hurry,” Baratz said. ""
This provides them with proper understanding and time by some tests before writing ‘Male’ or ‘Women’.
In this way, you live well - upbring the baby, love the baby.
You have a cute baby and enjoy it.
We don’t have to undergo a surgery in a hurry that cannot be returned.
He said, “This brings children to the process of making a decision and frees parents from a misconduct that they are cured. ""
Ultimately, the child will determine which sex is more comfortable with – and it will be very good.
It enables children to make decisions for their own.

Clive Palmer claimed that the interest of P.M. Tony Abbot is conflicting about the parent holiday plan
The Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer said that the Prime Minister Tony Abbot’s interest about the parent holiday plan is conflict as his daughters can get pregnant, and can benefit it.
The maharathi of the mining sector, which is in dispute with the payment of a carbon tax bill worth $6 million, has claimed, while they have attempted to answer questions about the struggle.
Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which can be important in determining how carbon and mining taxes are reduced.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only the ministers may have a conflict of interest, and said that the daughters of Mi Abbot can benefit individually from the policies.
M. Palmer said “A significant interest in the case of a given ancestral leave can be conflicted, because if any of his daughter is pregnant, he will have a direct interest that he or she may not get a holiday. ""
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared the Mi Palmer a winner of 53 votes of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax after the re-fall.
M. Palmer demanded the proliferation of election count to move the process faster.
The daughters of Tony Aot Frances and Bridgette.
Should the election result come two months after we have voted?
“We must have a better system,” he said. ""
Why can’t we have a system in which we fill out our diversification on the computer, instantly vote and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
M. Palmer also criticized the use of pensyl to mark on ballots.
So, because if a person does not like him, then can he wipe him?
Using a pencil in today’s round, it seems to be completely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying alternatives for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint attendant letter with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said that his policies include becoming an international air adda for the Sunshine Coast, and they brought their new work “very roguely.”
Public post is for public service.
“We don’t have any other awards in addition to the awards of history that we can serve the community at this critical time. ""
George Kerevan: Euro Dissolution Gives Choice to Scotts
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area throughout Europe as the condition of the EU membership.
Passport control over the burwick and signs stories about the border of the barbed wire on the walls of the heart.
The truth is that Strathclyde Paper described about the possible economic benefits of independent traffic with the rest of Europe, although - predictably - it did not describe in headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as needed.
Since now Scotland is not the Schengen area, Brussels will actually be affordable discounts for sustainable non-compliance Brussels in exchange to get what it wants from Scotland.
So, then, A-Khani.
And the matter which has been so long-term trapped has been lost. First I mean "independent" Passport Control "Babyuniyadh News was heard about 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should you expect to bid Europe from independent Scotland anyway?
Why to buy for Brussels of London, especially now?
Here is the real European news: The great, war-like plan of organizing Europe has finally stopped.
With the Euro crisis, the project Europe has officially dead.
Dedicated parties are gaining robustness to resist EU in the entire EU or to close Euro as equal currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurospectil Alternative for Germany party has established this year - Suddenly came and received about fifty lakh votes in the federal election of September, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems).
The plan to build federal Europe has always been domestic protests.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a common changer.
Along with the strict regulations imposed by the Berlin and European Central Bank, many people have to think that project Europe has gone far away due to the constraints imposed on national economies through compliing the same currency.
The high budget deficit of national governments did not have a very high role in the crisis of the euro - this was only true in terms of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized its members the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters - What German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in a position with the inherent loss of productivity than Germany.
The only measure is to reduce salary and public expenses – which have been encouraged by Berlin.
Ongoing budgets and currency problems have deeper European productivity.
In order to provide discounts to French and German energy firms on the expense of consumers - as a result of the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels, the European industries pay twice for electricity than the United Nations and four times for gas.
This is the cost loss we have seen people already in Granth.
The European Petrochemicals cannot protect the industry from being affected by affordable U.S. shell gas.
As a result, the feeling of rebellion in people is flaring, especially in France, who had ever been a major fan of the EU.
After the Uddha, France’s top politicians saw the EU as a measure to control Germany, and Paris to provide billing equal to the vetting in the world.
But Berlin is no longer required to Paris as a passport for political validity, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, due to which the economy of France is damaging.
Result: The righteous of Maryen Lee Pen, the EU Anti-National Front has conquered the third place pushing the ruling socialist in the recent nuisance.
This time is the most popular team with the front 24 percent vote in France - It will automatically benefit to the right, dissolution for the left that British Labour is as soon as they can not run it standarder.
What is Lee Pen doing with its new found fame in the midst of French whites, working class?
The team wants to use the EU elections to be the next year in the European Parliament to make the EU Anti-Serve currency Anti-Got.
If, as much as possible, the EU anti-parties in these elections perform well, then this type of fact can first affect the European Parliament.
My point of view is: Soon the EU will eliminate the confluence of the anti-and-verifiable anti-monetary sentiment in Europe.
The euro will not end up completely, but it will return to any form like the footer "(Sovereign) Europe of the nations" that will support the General Di Gall.
Germany and some of its sustained economies can maintain the Euro, but France and Southern Europe will reinstate its currencies.
I hope U.K. will keep itself away from this project in hope of raising closes with U.S.
However, the increasing interest of the vetting in the Pacific indicates that the UK will be left in the cold Atlantik.
What is Scotland after these?
We can choose to remain the area of Little England (essentially).
Or we can protect our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels to be different at the right time.
I think Scotland could do better performance in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It would be easier to work closely with other similar thinking countries in Europe of non-UTs.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic freedom while moving on the way to Norway.
S.N.P. government in Scotland - Notably - has been the most successful anti-monetary campaign in Europe, which had won the stunning majority in the year 2011 based on the proposed (so-executed) cataracts by Liber’s Chancellor Elastair Darling and then the Tori-Lib Deem Coalition.
It will be a matter of voting for freedom at this time for Scotland, as in that case it will have to accept the rules of Matthewita imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
So did you think of the Trewell Agent Beati century?
Flight Centre is advancing this trend.
The company has increased its full year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from Holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
This travel company expects that the full year underlying profit before tax will be between $325 million to $340 million, while in the previous forecast it was reported in between $305 million to $315 million.
If the target is attained as per the current guidance, the record received in the year 2011/12 will increase from 12 to 17 percent in the profit of $290.4 million.
The Managing Director Graham Turner said that the Flight Centre has earned a profit of 8 per cent in the first half, and has started well in its second half, especially in Australia and UK non-business journey.
He said that “Our 10 countries are in profits so far, and many countries, records prior to interest and tax contribution are on the way of full-year income. ""
This includes Australia and United Kingdom, which is usually our most profitable centres.
Leisure business in the second half in Australia has re-engaged, which meets the shortcoming of a slightly weak domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, the leisure business of the Flight Center also performed well in the UK, while corporate clients were spending less.
The U.S. business had seasonally weakened their losses in their first half, and it is expected to benefit the third consecutive year.
Flight Center shares were at $38.20 with an increase of 3 cents yesterday.

India’s largest businessman Mukesh Ambani that wife Neeta Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on November 1, 2013.
Nita is not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a very large party on this occasion.
A number of Bollywood stars arrived at Jodhpur to Shirkat in this party. Several big stars were seen catching Jodhpur flight on Mumbai airport in late May 31.
These stars include the name of Karishma Kapoor, Gita Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Poetry Khanna, Aishak Kapoor, An Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahual Bos etc.
Obviously, you can guess how big it will burn when the party is involved.
The UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore during the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In the reign of NDA (between the year 1999 to 2004) a round when the PM of Atal Vihari Bajpayee came for two consecutive years (2001-2002), no advertisement was issued by the government above Patel.
On Thursday, keeping the foundation stone of Sardar Patel’s 182m high ‘Stachi of Unity’ statue in Kevaria, said, ‘There was no advertisement on the occasion of the births of Sardar Patel before it.
While DAVP records show that UPA has spent Rs 4.10 crore in 2009-10, Rs 2.7 crore in 2010-11, Rs 1.4 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 at Sardar Patel’s ads.
When the Union Minister of Information and Broadcasting Manish Tiwari was asked about Modi’s claims, he said BJP’s PM does not speak on the basis of Candidate facts.
There was no advertisement on Patel in UPA year 2008.
The Tiwari said that this year was due to economic slowdown.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel’s ads are significantly lower than the amount spent on the births and courtesy of Nehru-Gandhi family members every year.
DAVP spent Rs.9.38 crore print ads for 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs.9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru for Mahatma Gandhi’s birth anniversary and Ponyaatithi.
When Manish Tiwari asked about this difference, he said, ‘This should not be seen from the expense of advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including things like the size of advertising or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, the people who oppose it are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
During this time, the sacrifice of the martyr Kesari was remembered and the most cultural events, including patriotism were also introduced.

Denis Deederot’s novel Gilome is a description of the best production design and time period in conversion by Nickelaux, but it has grown far more than it should be.

When he rebelles, he faces excessive cruelty to the hands of the Voluntary Person Superior, and becomes an object of sensual attraction for the second.
This film never goes into sexuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
It also has the risk of becoming a boring film for the audience due to the conviction of the narrative.

One name in the same verses comes from self-stressed Ambani.
On the post of the teacher at a school of a small village of Gujarat, the 3rd son of Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 28 December 1932.
The five brothers were of the third number.
The five offspring of the family include Ramanikalal, Natvar Red, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trialogana and Jasumati.
Due to economic tightness, the slowerness has to be left after high school.
Dhirubhai had started helping the home economic in the child.
At this time, they used to store the buzz near Gironar, the shop’s income was limited on the number of tourists visiting here.
Speaking of the first job of Dhirubhai, he had arrived at the Aden city of Yemen from the ship called Kabota at the age of 17 in 1949.
Here, his elder brother Ramanikal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no trouble getting jobs abroad.
But there was something else in the minds of slowing down.
So in 1954 they returned to Vattan.
In 1955, Mumbai reached a fortune by placing Rs 500 in pocket.
And this started their business journey.
From here, Dhirubai Ambani took steps that they never looked behind.
His name was famous not only abroad but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani took away from the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.

Is Europe’s high class ready to do business with UK?
Business for UK was launched in April and promised to bring the business together and determine what changes are needed for us with the UK’s employment and prosperity producer EU.
For that we conducted the largest and most detailed surveys of UK business leaders, asking them what they have ideas about UK business with EU.
U-Gov has been a representative of the UK’s business size, areas and locations for 1000 business leaders.
The findings of this survey can be amazing for many people.
We found that a large part of businessmen now wants to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU members are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritize new business relationships with countries such as China, India and Brazil, and not to engage in the long-term and second process of reforming the mysterious entities of the EU.
Most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster when asked their views about specific policy areas from monopolies regulation to product law.
Common dissatisfaction with a single market could be seen very easily, businessmen say that the price of regulation of Brussels is far more than the benefits of becoming a part of the trading sector of Europe – Even 40 percent of the vast businessmen who were traditionally favored by European companies agreed that.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of professional leaders found that a large part clearly wants the UK, with EU, to move on the path of business-based relationship and treaty change rather than politics.
The findings, which were seen in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are motivated towards a “surgent change” that will provide the UK back its lost power.
It has a very high price - The issue of treaty change for the UK and getting a better deal was changed by 16 per cent vote in favor of staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey suggests that UK practitioners support their plan to negotiate on UK membership terms in EU.
It also demonstrated that practitioners expect to revoke the current power balance by making a meaningful change in favor of U.K.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming increasingly compulsory, as Eurozone is stepping forward towards the aforementioned economy and the fiscal union.
Priority must be the number and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that it means a new focused focus on business and basic changes in the regulation strategy of Brussels.

“Most of these headlines looked at Carolines, and became great success, to the level where they became too big to play in the club. ""
We built this festival as a way to continue working with them.
This year’s program includes the presence of Vanda Cyx, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maihar, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retired individuals in Madison Svoire Garden, “Stand Up for Heroes” including Bruce Springstein, John Stovert, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby.

Proceeding from the soil, rivers and forests to provide free medical service
Dr. Georges Well, a free health service in the rural areas of Cameroon
Well and their team sees hundreds of patients on almost every weekend
There is not too much doctor in West African countries; 5000 people have only one doctor
Give your vote here or via mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or to make the protagonist of the CNN year for any other top 10.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue their exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Well saw his sick father coming to the sense and unconscious, going to the hospital, which were not appropriately involved in helping them.
Jamel Vell, the capital of Cameron in 1981 was left in the car crash next to Jeudede.
At the beginning they had only broken hands, but an infection increased that spread to their brain, and he built blood pressure, which affected their remaining life.
“There was no neurosurgeon in Cameron,” says Georges Well. ""
We take our father out of Cameroon if we have money.
Instead, Vel is dizzing highly crowded clinics and hospitals about his father and receiving treatment.
“It’s not easy,” Well said. ""
You’ll get out of the house at 5 pm in the morning that you’ll be the first to reach the hospital, but it doesn’t happen.
There are many patients.
Some people can await in the mouth of death.
Since the death of the father of Vel in 2002, the situation did not change much.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5000 person.
If compared, there is a physician for each 413 persons in the United States.
And if there is a doctor, many residents of Cameroon can not afford him.
Two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is of private sector.
“The only problem of them is poverty,” says Well. ""
And because of being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his fathers and his countrymen, Vel took a determination to resolve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have carried out 700 free surgery last year.
They also became a physician themselves, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital of Yonde.
And they started non-profit organization Eskovim, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical service.
Since 2008, he and his own group have helped around 32,000 people.
On almost every Friday they sit in vans for about 30 people, damaging medical supplies to the roof and go to the countryside where people need therapy.
Sometimes there is no luck with them.
They have to move more than one time by pushing the vehicle from rivers and soils.
But when they reach, they really get respected with heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodations offered by the community.
The free medical service in these villages is actually the reason to celebrate, and well – with its large smile and endless energy – including happiness.
The next morning their team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
“We’re getting from 500 people in each journey,” Well said. ""
They come from the village to about 60 km away, and they come to visit.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical services.
Malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases of many people are treated.
Others Donated Spectacles or free birth certificate can be found -- This document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening, the Dal performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually done at school building, town hall or at home; After the procedure, the patient goes to the recovery place, and makes the space for the next person.
The group’s generator publishes in the room with operation and sanitizing equipment, and well and their volunteers work on Sunday morning and evening.
This is the roomy motion, but the musicians of the village generally assist in keeping the team inspired.
Well said, “They keep us awakening and playing drums all night to continue their work. ""
On Sunday their team returns back to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
This group includes Cameron doctor and foreign medical students - Last year 700 are free surgery, and they know that their support can change the world of people they support.
A person told that he will be able to rework due to free hernia surgery.
“This will change the future of my family and my family.” ""
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgeon in the hospital, wells also work in private medical clinics around Yonde at night.
He told it is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; Part of the rest is fulfilled by private donations.
“I don’t know when they’re sleeping,” said Volley O’Mally, a medical student at the University of Drexell in Philadelphia and a group of well. ""
They are always either in the hospital, or attempting to earn money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Mally who come from United States and Europe to join the well campaign, this is the experimental opportunity they can never get into their country.
“In which we help to capture or clean blood stains for Dr. Well, we have been able to achieve experimental experience in the field of medicine. ""
You will never have the opportunity to do this as a second year medical student in the US.
Volunteer students usually spend from themselves to reach Cameroon, and they come up with medical supplies of Akasar Dan.
But after the arrival of Yonde, let them live, and take care of the instructions.
“There is no doubt that they are heroes. ""
They give their lives to this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never to end.
For the well, almost a kind of workload, do not have difficulty.
Helping other people live happy lives, fulfilling the promise from their father, these are things that give them great joy.
"I am very happy when doing this job. ""
And I think of my father.
I hope they’ll see what I’m doing.
I’m doing this to laugh people, reduce their pain.

Pope Francis will announce the name of the first cardinal in February
Vatican has announced Thursday that Pope Francis will create the new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-class pastors in the Catholic Church, their positions are only below the Pope, and that people choose the Pope, so Frances will make the first group of their individuals, which will eventually help to choose their successor.
Now there are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, cardinals are not allowed to participate in the election of Pope after reaching the age of 80 years - It falls into a group of 120 “Cardinal Electors”.
In a statement declaring the news, Vatican spokesperson Fadar Fedrico Lombardy said that before the ceremony of promotion of new cardinals, the meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, called Pop-Sabha.
“Pop Francis has decided to tell their decision to hold the Pop-Projects of February in advance, so it becomes simple to plan other meetings with cardinals participation from different countries of the world. ""
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal pollers was likely to decrease by February.
He said that the Pope normally, the number of cardinal electors is as low as 120, the number of cardinals, and the name of cardinals over 80 years of age as they wish.
Valero said, the next year’s Pope-Sabha will be significant, as it will be the first Pope-Sabha after the Francis is selected in March this year.
Currently there is a kind of bias towards Europe and Italy in particular.
He said “It would be interesting to see if the new Pope to reestablish the balance, even cardinals are nominated from the rest of the world.
Forty percent in South America is Roman Catholics, but their number in cardinals is very low.
The Cardinals Council by Francis – a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose work is to look for ways to improve the church, will also be the first cardinals to be selected after being formed.
First of this, the Pope decided on all things.
“Now Frances has chosen these eight cardinals to assist themselves,” Valero said. ""
He said that there is such a "possession" that Frances sought advice from cardinals.
But we are not in this situation. It is completely new.
Valero said that typically the Pope ranks cardinal to the bishop of large spaces, but Frances were “to be completely surprised – so we don’t know who they would declare. ""
Overseas staff on 457 visas can undergo the "Promotion" test
The government is being considered about a “primacy” test for foreign employees on 457 visas, as it aims to expand a rigorous proceedings.
If adopted, this test will be applied through a psyche designed to prevent 457 used to fill in unskilled positions in Australia or to deliver to family and friends in a voluntary manner.
Today a government discussion paper was released, the former Labour M.P. Maxine McQ today said it can shun the neighboring countries of Australia.
“Foreign people are reaching at the end of the queue” he said to the US Anda Institute today and a very unpleasant repetition on such a time, while Unions have sought a safe labor market. ""
Historically, it was believed that white workers had to be provided protection – and if some people in the region have seen the echo of that historical evidence, I would not be surprised.
The discussion paper depicts a framework of 12 measures on which former immigration minister Chris Boven was considered first.
Immigrant Minister Brendon O’Connor who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met the authorities about the trafficking people, has executed five institutional changes, while remaining under consideration.
If the terminology is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined whether the nomination is true under such circumstances, in which the nominee, the owner of the visa sponsor or the coherent person is concerned or personal partner.
Businessmen may need to count the number of 457 visa holders, as the first practitioner who wanted to sponsor a low number of employees, hired hundreds of people.
During this time, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died from suspected cardiac arrest after visiting a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The nine-year-old son of the man came to Australia on his journey with him, and after his father’s death on Wednesday, an adult cousin has tied to the collapse, which was on the same vessel.
The Australian authorities brought the person to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
