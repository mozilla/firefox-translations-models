RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders in its foreign exchange department, two people familiar with the matter said, in another sign of regulators&#39; growing global investigation into suspected currency market manipulation. It is progressing at a rapid pace.
Some of the world&#39;s biggest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed they are cooperating with regulators in the investigation into the world&#39;s largest financial market, with $5.3 trillion traded each day .
The two traders will be the first RBS employees to be suspended as the investigation proceeds in what appears to be a repeat of the Libor interbank lending manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, confirming it had received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago the bank said, &quot;Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators.&quot;
Last month, people familiar with the matter said RBS had passed records of emails and instant messages sent and received by the former trader to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Ussher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been made redundant from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on leave last week, while a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
People familiar with the matter said that Mr. Usher&#39;s instant messaging group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it took action against some of its employees this week after FINMA, the Swiss regulator, said it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation at several Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally – the European Commission, FINMA, Switzerland&#39;s competition authority Vico, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – have sued bankers for colluding to manipulate currency markets. Investigating the allegations.
HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse also have conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the matter said.
Banks are closely examining years&#39; worth of instant messages and emails for clues to any wrongdoing.
News of the investigation has sent shockwaves among traders in a sector that has been among the top earners in the investment bank&#39;s trading arm for the past several years but faces a challenge this year. This is happening because due to low fluctuations in currencies, opportunities for speculators have reduced.
Some bankers have tried to play down the issue by saying that manipulating the extremely large and highly liquid foreign exchange market is an impossible scenario, but senior traders say that is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large volume of forex trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that &quot;you can influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price.&quot; Can start doing.&quot;
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced it was laying off traders this week from its exchange-traded funds desk in London, which made losses of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said that &quot;we believe the trader acted alone, and has been brought under control.&quot;
A new politics of board change has started in the municipalities.
Recently, the Congress led board in Sainthia municipality of Birbhum district was transformed into a Trinamool board due to defection of councilors.
This change happened due to most of the Congress councilors, including the municipality chairman, joining Trinamool.
Not only Congress but some councilors of CPI(M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also taken up the suppression of Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai considers this as a good sign for the party.
He says that 10 Congress councilors including Sainthia Municipality Chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta joined Trinamool.
Some councilors of Left Front including CPI(M) have also held the Trinamool flag.
All of them have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become a part of Trinamool and as per the numerical strength, Sainthia Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Shri Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the blueprint for the development of Bengal that has been set under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties including Congress, CPI(M), CPI, and Forward Bloc are moving to join Trinamool Congress.
Eligible leaders from any party are welcome in Trinamool.
Before the elections of five municipalities to be held on November 22, Trinamool&#39;s capture of the Municipal Board due to defection of Congress councilors in Sainthia Municipality is being considered important in political circles.
Before this, there is an example of Trinamool capturing the Congress ruled Municipal Board in Left Front ruled Haldia and Nadia also.
When Trinamool takes over the municipal boards in the districts due to defection, those joining the party get a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress General Secretary Mukul Rai is excited about the leaders breaking away from other parties and joining Trinamool.
He says that those who break away from any party are welcome in Trinamool.
He claims that people&#39;s faith in the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition party CPI(M) says that lower level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
Fearing the terror of Trinamool Congress, people are joining it.
CPI(M) is considering the change in the boards of elected local bodies as an attack on democracy.
Any party has the right to increase its support base in a democratic way, but it is natural to question the propriety of changing votes for the sake of power.

Asaram, who is in jail on sexual harassment charges, was once again disappointed by the Supreme Court on Friday.
Asaram argued that in the media coverage, he is being presented as Dracula who drinks the blood of children, but the court rejected his demand to ban the media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P. Sathasivam refused to order the media to stop running news about Asaram, saying it has seen every word reported in the media and sees no reason to interfere in it.
How can we stop them when they are getting information from the police and others.
Earlier, Asaram&#39;s lawyer accused the media of showing exaggerated news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
They should file a case against whom, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying that they had other options.
Even before this, the court had once rejected Asaram&#39;s demand to ban media coverage.
A study has been announced by the British Government into increasing Scotland&#39;s benefits from the HS2 rail project.
Works by HS2 indicate high-speed services in Scotland and the north of England will start soon with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Cremer said the project would &quot;unite Britain.&quot;
Scotland&#39;s Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was &quot;excited&quot; to be working with the UK Government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Once the second phase is complete, lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building a high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British Government, which was in talks with Transport for Scotland, instructed HS2 Limited to consider possibilities to further improve rail capacity and journey times for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the potential to reduce journey times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: &quot;Our aim for HS2 is a truly national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer together.&quot;
We are going ahead with HS2 because the benefits will be huge.
Without it we will face problems related to the capacity of our rail network.
But it is also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be better connected because of HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: &quot;Today&#39;s announcement is good news for Scotland.&quot;
For the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for a &quot;clear&quot; return of Scotland to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “While high speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland for the whole issue of high speed rail across the UK.
That&#39;s why we&#39;re excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options for bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, creating benefits for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government already plans. Is planning the same.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with British Government ministers next year and deciding together on further action.

The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said that it cannot tell the media not to report about the information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram&#39;s lawyer said that Asaram is being called Dracula in this case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this matter but they are not being followed.
On this the Supreme Court said that in such a situation you have many other remedies which you can use.
Asaram&#39;s lawyer said that there are thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are two channels in particular which cause him more trouble.
These people are damaging his image and doing one-sided reporting.
Asaram&#39;s rights should be protected in this matter.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram&#39;s lawyer that he had other legal remedies he could use.
Black box in your car?
As America&#39;s road planners struggle to find funding to fix their crumbling highway system, many are seeing the solution in a tiny black box that fits neatly on your car&#39;s dashboard. Is.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motorist and transmits that information to officials, is being used today in Washington and D.C. to overhaul the aging system for funding America&#39;s major roads. The issue has become a controversial endeavor for the state planning office.
Even a normally boring task like highway planning has suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant coalitions.
Libertarian Environmentalists to rally support for allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly where you drive - and then use this information to generate tax bills Have met with groups.
The Tea Party is aghast.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned, raising a variety of privacy issues.
While Congress can&#39;t agree on whether to take further action, many states aren&#39;t waiting.
They are exploring how, over the next decade, they can move to a system in which drivers are paid for every mile driven on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken the black boxes for test drives, some of which are equipped with GPS. There is monitoring.
It is really an essential item for our country.
“This is not a matter of whether we choose or not,” says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Association of Governments, which is planning to track every mile driven by motorists in California by 2025. Is planning to do.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
The technology is there to do this.
The main reason this is happening is that the country&#39;s Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes paid by American citizens at the gas pump, is nearly bankrupt.
Americans don&#39;t buy as much gas as they used to.
Cars now go more miles on a gallon of gas than ever before.
The federal tax has not increased in 20 years, standing at 18.4 cents a gallon.
Due to the high price of gas, politicians avoid increasing taxes even by a penny.
&quot;The gas tax is simply not sustainable,&quot; says Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently fitted 500 cars with tracking devices to test a pay-per-mile system.
“In the long run this will make the most logical choice,” he says.
Wonks calls this a mileage-based user fee.
It&#39;s not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals, since it could, for example, change taxes to drive changes in car driving patterns, which would reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gases. Can help to do.
California planners are eager for the system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set in the state&#39;s ambitious global warming laws.
But House Transportation Committee Chairman, Rep. Bill Shuster (R-PA) also considers black boxes to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors at the Regions Foundation also favor driver payment per mile.
&quot;This isn&#39;t just a tax going down a blind well,&quot; said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at Regions.
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former US Secretaries of Transportation, who in their 2011 report urged Congress to move forward with per-mile payment.
U.S. The Senate last year approved a $90-million testing project that would have involved 10,000 cars.
But acting on the concerns of rural lawmakers, representing people who have to walk large miles every day to get to work or get into town, House leadership killed that proposal in place .
Yet many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
Most interested is Oregon, which has enlisted 5,000 drivers in the nation&#39;s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state a mileage fee instead of a gas tax.
Nevada has already completed initial testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is experimenting with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state transportation departments along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was recently installed on the cars of 50 volunteer drivers, drivers were impatient at the thought of the government monitoring their every move.
&quot;The main problem was concerns about Big Brother and things like that,&quot; says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
This is not something that people wanted.
As the trial progresses, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: &quot;It would be fairly easy to convert these devices into full-fledged tracking devices.&quot;
There is no need to develop a huge, unmanageable technology infrastructure that must be expanded to keep track of everyone&#39;s daily movements.
Nevada is one of several states trying to get affordable technology that would let the state capture how many miles a car is driving per day, but not where and when. Time is running out.
Khan said that if you can do that, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
The firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax defaulters.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, which paid drivers based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing has appealed to highway planners because it has a GPS. is not used and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at fixed time intervals.
&quot;If you don&#39;t track people&#39;s speed and their location, they&#39;re more likely to adopt this approach,&quot; said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
There were some major mistakes in these early state programs.
There are also much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
Those G.P.S. With or without GPS You can choose the device.
Or you can choose not to get a device at all, instead paying a flat fee based on the average miles driven by state residents.
Other places hope this concept can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more features rather than less on the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that would also allow payment for parking meter fees, offer &quot;pay as you drive&quot; insurance, and collect real-time speed data from other drivers. It will create a collection of maps that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
&quot;Motorists will be attracted to participate because of the benefits they receive,&quot; the city planning document notes.
However, some transportation planners wonder if maybe all the talk about pay-by-the-mile is a big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said Congress could easily deal with the problem of the bankrupt highway trust fund by increasing the gas tax.
An additional one-time or annual fee may also be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other cars whose vehicles do not use much gas to pay their fair share.
&quot;Why do we need radical surgery when aspirin can do the trick,&quot; said Randy Rentschler, the commission&#39;s director of legislative and public affairs.
If we do this, millions of car drivers will be concerned about their privacy and many other things.
Jagran Bureau, Srinagar: Police have reportedly removed the security of former minister Ghulam Hasan Khan, who joined Congress from People&#39;s Democratic Party.
Khan held the state government responsible for this and said that his security had been removed due to political reasons.
It may be noted that Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the election from Shopian on PDP ticket in 2002, was a member of Mufti Muhammad Sayeed&#39;s cabinet when he was the Chief Minister.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said that I have got security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, which is called a stronghold of terrorists.
A CRPF security squad led by a sub-inspector was deployed at my house.
I also have bodyguards, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security squad was leaving my house, I talked to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate the matter.
However, when Kashmir IGP Abdul Ghani Mir was contacted in this regard, he denied knowledge of the matter and said that it is a sensitive matter.
I will personally investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader was removed.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifudin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my knowledge.
If Hasan Khan&#39;s security has been compromised then it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and will be coming to Kashmir in the next day or two.
I will discuss this issue with the concerned administration.

C.D.C. WHO issues child allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines for controlling children&#39;s food allergies in schools.
U.S. Such guidelines have been issued by the government for the first time as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies is increasing.
Now the US One in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
This guidance provides information for schools on how to notify teachers and staff about children&#39;s food allergies, and how to handle an allergic reaction if it occurs.
Schools have also been suggested to stock epinephrine to respond to potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis – the EpiPen brand auto-injector being the most commonly used.
The state Legislature recently updated the rules, making it easier for schools to stockpile larger amounts of epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from an allergic reaction.
Children may say, &quot;It feels like something is pricking my tongue,&quot; &quot;It feels like there are hairs on my tongue,&quot; or &quot;My tongue is tingling.&quot;
Aircraft electrical equipment rules remain in effect in Australia for now
Australian air travelers will continue to be required to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite moves to loosen device regulations in the US.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left the option open to US airlines to change their procedures so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during critical stages of flight, provided those devices are &quot;aircraft&quot; &quot;Stay in mode.
Travelers can do this on many flights now, but many people don&#39;t like being unable to access their e-books while taking off and landing.
Australian air service companies are considering this decision, which would require much more work than US air service companies to do to meet this requirement, but have indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their procedures. Not there.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical devices during critical phases of flight are still in effect in Australia.
“CASA currently does not have any specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment on board aircraft,” the authority said, “This issue falls within the regulations that require air service operating companies to ensure that the safety “Systems are always in place, and passengers are required to follow safety instructions given by crew members.”
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment systems, is prepared to comply with this change, but has deferred further action on the regulator&#39;s instructions. Asked to do.
The spokesperson said &quot;We would welcome a review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical devices, as we really feel it will provide a better experience for customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) ) is in our planes.
Qantas said it would follow current rules for now.
It said &quot;Our current policy is that electrical devices cannot be used during takeoff and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change this.&quot;
FAA decisions apply to US airlines.
As such, we are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travelers and we will certainly consider the FAA&#39;s decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary by individual US aircraft carrier and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline service companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as revise their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programs and briefings to passengers.
The FAA said it will allow passengers to use handheld, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all altitudes after airlines verify the tolerances of their aircraft.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their devices while the aircraft is landing.
The group has also suggested keeping heavy equipment safely under the seat or in overhead compartments during takeoff and landing.
Selected 42 senior leaders of the state BJP gave him a warm welcome at the airport.
It is noteworthy that Modi has come to visit Bihar for the consolation yatra organized by BJP.
Organizing the consolation yatra is an effort by the BJP to provide solace to the families of those killed in the Patna blasts.
It is noteworthy that during Narendra Modi&#39;s Hunkar rally in Patna on October 27, a total of seven blasts took place one after the other.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists involved in the blasts was to create a stampede during the rally, so that more and more people get casualties and create an atmosphere of panic in the state.
The terrorists&#39; intention did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
BJP has declared all of them martyrs.
Party leaders have set out on a journey from Thursday carrying the urn of ashes from his village.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will be immersed together in the Ganga in Patna.
As a part of this journey, the consolation yatra is organized.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
He will go to the villages of those killed in the blasts and meet their families from 7 am on Saturday.
During this meeting, he will also give a check of Rs 5 each to the families of the deceased.
BJP has already announced this financial help.
The accused used to commit fraud in the name of buying and selling of shares by opening accounts of investors in the name of trading firms.
Probably for the first time in the state, such revelations have revealed fraud worth crores of rupees.
At present the police have not been able to find out who is the leader of the gang, but the police have detained seven people including the accused who was looking after his work in the state.
This gang operated a fake commodity market in the name of MetaTrader-5.
The executives of the company used to take cash from investors and give it by creating fake IDs on a fake software.
Due to this, the shares purchased by the investors were visible to the accused during trading.
It was even known which share was purchased at what price.
In reality, no shares were purchased nor any transaction took place because no demat account of the investors was opened and shares were falsely displayed on this fake software.
Police are estimating that hundreds of people have fallen prey to this gang.
In the name of giving profit, each investor was made to invest Rs 2 to 5 lakh.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while his six other associates have been caught from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohra, it is necessary for any share trading company to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this the company can get its investors to do share trading through itself.
Then the demat account of the investor is opened so that shares can be bought and sold, but this company named MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor did stock trading.
This company had purchased the server for itself citing trading on 24 September 2012 in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people are being cheated in the name of investment through this company.
Currently, eight businessmen from Indore have come forward to complain to the cyber cell.
Even after selling his purchased shares at a profit, his money was not transferred to his account.
On this he started demanding profit amount from the company officials.
Investors are even saying that the fake ID given to them always showed the price of their purchased shares as low.
The accused used to decide this price at their own level.
The company has appointed its CEO and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
Agents used to advise people to join this company by luring them with higher profits.
After this, some people were asked to deposit Rs 2 lakh and some up to Rs 5 lakh.
Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that US spying had crossed the line in some cases.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance program.
Kerry&#39;s admission came while addressing the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London via video link.
Kerry said that I assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted in the attempt to obtain information.
Meanwhile, an important committee of the US Parliament has approved a bill to limit the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency [NSA].
Its aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore public confidence that has been damaged by the revelations of large-scale phone tapping.
This move of the Senate has been welcomed by six American companies including Google and Yahoo.
NSA has also breached the data centers of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill [FISA], which cuts down on the NSA, by 11 votes to 4.
The bill outlines several restrictions under the US Patriot Act, including a ban on outright phone tapping.
Under FISA, deliberate unauthorized collection and use of data will be considered a crime and there is a provision for a prison sentence of ten years.
This bill will become law after it is passed in both houses of Congress, the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Committee chair and Senator Dianne Festin said that the NSA&#39;s phone recording program is within the law and I believe it has made an important contribution to the country&#39;s security.
But despite this, more transparency should be brought in it.
Not only this, the protection of public privacy should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, angry over the revelations of NSA&#39;s Internet surveillance program, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported this bill.
In a letter written to the senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of the lawmakers to curb the large-scale phone recording of NSA.
It is noteworthy that the documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden exposed the misdeeds of NSA.
There is considerable anger in the international community after the NSA revealed that it was monitoring telephone conversations of heads of state of 35 countries, including Germany and France.
In an unexpected admission, John Kerry said that the U.S. Espionage &quot;has gone too far inappropriately&quot;
John Kerry unexpectedly admitted this to the US on its surveillance program. The U.S.&#39;s protective stance has softened, indicating that its espionage sometimes &quot;goes inappropriately far.&quot;
The Minister of State has also admitted that N.S.A. He is also guilty, along with Barack Obama, of being on &quot;autopilot&quot; in the form of scandalous disclosures to whistleblower Edward Snowden about the US&#39;s spying activities.
This revelation shocked the U.S. This has caused a diplomatic earthquake in the government&#39;s relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Open Government conference in London, Mr Kerry said: &quot;There&#39;s no question that the President, I, and others in the government knew indeed about some of the things that were going on with Automatic Pilot , because looking back, it had the potential in World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War, and then, certainly, 9/11.
They are from the US. He has become the first high-ranking member of the government to acknowledge that the U.S. The spying crossed its limits, but it has been stressed that no one&#39;s rights were abused.
He added: &quot;In some cases, it has gone inappropriately too far.&quot;
And the President is determined to try to clarify this for people and is conducting a thorough review right now so that no one gets the sense of abuse.
I assure you that nothing wrong is happening to innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized, however, that the N.S.A. It served a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He further explained: &quot;We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up.&quot;
There is a fundamentalist extremism in the world that is committed to killing people, blowing them up and attacking governments.
So if you&#39;re able to stop it before it happens then what&#39;s the problem?
We have actually saved planes from falling, buildings from collapsing, and people from being murdered because we have been able to know in advance what others were planning.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said that the so-called U.S. U.S. to help address concerns abroad about spying Lawmakers from the U.S. will go to Europe, and European countries will be sent to the U.S. We will try to explain the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he has spoken with members of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about threats to stop their participation in counterterrorism organizations because of their frustration with surveillance by the National Security Agency.
Murphy, a first-term Democrat and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington, &quot;It&#39;s really important to U.S. national security interests that in terms of our counterterrorism efforts European countries should be with us.&quot;
To make it clear to European countries that we need to continue working together to fight terrorism, the NSA One should not be swayed by their anger about the programme.
NSA News of the company recording millions of phone conversations in Europe has shocked the U.S. This has soured relations with some NATO allies, although the head of the agency said the reports were not entirely true, and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and shared with the United Nations.
Other revelations in the documents leaked by Snowden show that the N.S.A. has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the practice of spying on allies, calling it necessary and saying it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was arranging a congressional trip that would likely take place this year, and he expected the delegation to include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers will be released in the coming days.
He said the itinerary was still being worked out.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said some &quot;impractical relationships&quot; would also have to be sacrificed.
He said European leaders also need to be honest with their people about the spying programs they have used over the years.
&quot;Although we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are being spied on,&quot; Murphy said.

NSA Blamed &quot;internal error&quot; rather than hackers for website crash
The enigmatic National Security Agency said on Friday that its website was down for a few hours due to some technical glitch and not due to hackers as some people claimed online.
&quot;NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a pre-scheduled update,&quot; the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that the disruption was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack is not true.
In the evening, online server trackers had found that N.S.A. The website was down for at least six hours, and the site is still inaccessible for some users.
NSA A spokesperson for A.B.C. News that the agency&#39;s internal, sensitive networks were &quot;at all&quot; not compromised.
The spokesperson said no classified information was at risk.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are DDoS. NSA by attack Are responsible for disrupting the website.
D.D.O.S. The attack is designed to drive so much traffic to the target website that the site is shut down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively crude and the attacks are not aimed at penetrating the internal network of the target system.
The formerly highly secretive NSA, once nicknamed &quot;No Such Agency&quot;, has been the subject of public discussion and criticism in recent months as revelations about its massive foreign and domestic spying programs. Has become the subject of criticism - the former NSA who were collectively disillusioned.

Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy on a dangerous mountain face 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being involved in a minor road collision
He was found three days later by a dog walker trapped in a mine.
Firefighters lowered the front part of the cliff with a rope to save the dog from death.
After the puppy somehow got stuck on a precarious mountain face 50 feet above the ground, he was saved by firefighters.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cocker spaniel, ran away after being involved in a road collision on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from a mine on Wednesday.
Her owners Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, of Denholm, were at the Flappit mine in West Yorkshire to be reunited with Ruby, and have thanked West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They frantically searched for their lost dog after it ran away following a minor accident, and posted appeals on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed Doc Walker spotted Ruby on the mountain in the mine, 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station arrived at the scene and lowered Ruby down with a rope and used a stomach tube to get her off the cliff.
Specialist technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: &#39;She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the cliff face, 50 feet from the top and bottom.
She did not make a single movement during the rescue, she remained as if she were a stone.
But now she is well.
After that she was eating biscuits.
This was a completely unusual cry for help.
In fact, just seeing the dog is incredible.
Special technical rescue officer Peter Law said: &quot;Ruby was fortunate to survive.&quot;
He was likely to be seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where she was found to be fine except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: &quot;It was horrific to watch the rescue work.&quot;
At first I couldn&#39;t believe how she reached there.
It&#39;s amazing to have it back in your hands.
The vet said that if she had gotten too tired and collapsed she would have definitely fallen over.
The fire brigade did an excellent job.
What he did was really very courageous.
We are indebted to them, and they were all excellent.
From Kigali Mr. Alderson also said: &quot;We were worried she might fall, but she stayed put.&quot;
The fire brigade did a wonderful job.
I can&#39;t believe how she got there.
Due to which the litigants had to face problems.
Addressing the meeting organized on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong anger over the deteriorating law and order in the state.
He said that the rapidly increasing attacks on advocates and their families prove that criminals have become fearless.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents that happened recently at different places, he said that when the advocate community is not safe then the safety of the common man can be easily estimated.
Frontier Airlines to impose carry-on baggage fees
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers $100 to store carry-on luggage on board their planes.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday said passengers can keep the entire compartment.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O&#39;Malley said the $100 fee is meant to get passengers to take care of the charge in advance.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to charge that,&quot; he said.
Airlines started charging for the first and second checked bags in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid fees are stuffing as much as they can into carry-on baggage that is stashed in the overhead compartment, which often means there is less space in this compartment.
The fee is a way to bring less passengers on board.
O&#39;Malley said this new charge is not really about raising money.
It&#39;s about the Frontier that for the most loyal customers, finding overhead bin space has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers purchasing tickets through the airline&#39;s own website do not have to pay this.
This means that a traveler in line at a frontier gate can get a bag free, while the next person in line might pay $100 for an identical bag.
O&#39;Malley said Frontier&#39;s website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure passengers are aware of the fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier&#39;s new carry-on fees won&#39;t begin until the summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.
Baggage fees are being viewed by many on Wall Street as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of losses.
Most, however, have not even touched the carry-on bag fee.
Spirit Airlines Inc. Airlines first introduced carry-on fees three years ago, and fellow discounter Allegiant Air followed suit.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungary&#39;s Wizz Air, which tracks add-on fees, said Jay Sorensen, an airline consultant.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit&#39;s carry-on fee brings in $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew on Spirit and expressed surprise at the unusual carry-on bag fees passengers faced at the gate.
&quot;The boarding process was the smoothest I had seen in my entire airline career,&quot; he said.
I gnashed my teeth and expected to see a fight out at the gate.
&quot;The plane was full and they said it climbed lickety-split.&quot;
Frontier is also following Spirit&#39;s $2 charge for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said passengers who pick up a soda or juice can keep the entire can, and will give the free coffee only once.
It will still give away water.
US Airways briefly tried charging for beverages in 2008, but they backed off seven months later after passengers complained and no other major airlines followed suit.
Frontier&#39;s move to charge passengers a carry-on fee if they don&#39;t purchase directly from the airline is its latest effort to drive customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel seller Orbitz $10 to $25 for each such ticket sold.
This is why all airlines have an incentive to drive passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September many frequent flier miles began to be given away by half to customers who purchased from an online travel agency from these individuals
On Wednesday, it reduced mileage awards to 25 percent of trip miles.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows solo travelers to choose their seats in advance if they purchase directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is declining and it is losing money.
Revenue declined 9 percent and its flight capacity declined nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to resolve Frontier&#39;s finances as part of the sale of the airline.
Chinese newspaper that argues will be &quot;renovated&quot;
A Chinese newspaper that ran a front-page appeal for the release of a reporter convicted of defamation will be renovated, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou newspaper New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write a fabricated story about a partially state-owned company.
The regulator said New Express now has to undergo a &quot;complete revamp&quot;.
The order for &quot;reform&quot; came from the Guangdong Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television Administration.

The regulator said in a statement that &quot;the editorial management of New Express was in disarray.&quot;
It said it had decided to &quot;impose an administrative penalty by revoking Chen Yongzhou&#39;s reporter&#39;s license.&quot;
It &quot;directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to conduct a thorough reform of New Express, investigated those responsible at New Express, and recommended immediately revising the leadership team of New Express.&quot;
Mr. Chen had written several articles in New Express alleging financial irregularities at a construction-equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained his newspaper published a two-page appeal for his release, and said that Mr. Supports Chen&#39;s journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen admitted to writing and publishing false stories for money, appearing on state television.
He told the state broadcaster CCTV. &quot;In this case I have damaged Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people&#39;s trust,&quot; he said.
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realized my mistakes.
Mr. Following Chen&#39;s apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate his report.

The players of this team keep making new records every day in Tests and now their status seems to be gradually increasing in ODIs too.
A great example of this was also seen on Thursday when Bangladesh defeated the good New Zealand team in the ODI series and took the title, taking an unassailable lead.
With the sharp bowling of Sohag Ghazi and Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh defeated New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI and took an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.

Earlier, despite a half-century by Tamim Iqbal (58), Bangladesh was all out for 247 runs in 49 overs.
Anderson and James Neesham together took eight wickets.
Anderson took four wickets for 40 runs, while Neesham took four wickets for 53 runs.

Police have recovered fake registry, fake seals, laptop and photo copies of fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjeet Singh Gill said that the arrested accused include Rajeev Aggarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar, Haibowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohada and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of Registrar Office (East) has absconded from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with the clerk and record keeper of the registrar&#39;s office, Balbir Singh, used to extract documents from the records of vacant and old lands and then buy new stamp papers and prepare fake registries on them.
Not only this, after that the real registry was made to disappear and fake registry records were added.
After this the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on forged documents.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these forged documents.
After this, the real owner of the land kept facing pressure from the police and administration.
The accused who got the fake registry prepared kept a special eye on the NRIG lands.
Because there is no one to look after the NRIG land.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare fake registry of those lands and sell them.
Police Commissioner Gill said that the accused told during interrogation that till now they have prepared around 150 fake registries.
According to the police, cases of fraud and theft have already been registered against gang leader Rajeev.
Children should be taught myths and legends &quot;as models for the author&#39;s way of life&quot;.
Thor stories could show that &quot;brute strength is no match for subtle tricks,&quot; while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths taught were &quot;far too wild, and in some cases even obscene, and would not be appropriate to be taught in schools,&quot; with Cross Lee Holland advocating &quot;careful selection&quot; of age-appropriate works.
&quot;I find it amazing, in America, myth and folklore are already a part of education,&quot; he said.
I have been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He called the authors and teachers &quot;more didactic&quot; and that it was &quot;a new turn&quot; for children, with the messages &quot;being presented&quot; in entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon as well as authored a Penguin book of Norwegian myths and British folklore, said: &quot;You may have many good intentions but it would be better to keep it out of sight.&quot;
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for a child and an adult author writing for an adult requires some sense of hope.
But it has an innate sense of good and evil because everything has to be simplified or come to a happy ending.
And that submission should be revealed through a story rather than told.
Old base is not showing.
BJP&#39;s prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election rally on Friday.
On this occasion, Modi said, &#39;In many states and the Center of the country, sometimes a coalition government was formed, sometimes a Congress government, sometimes a Communist government and sometimes a BJP government was formed.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I appeal to the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
Which team did what?
If there is a comparative result then the country will not face the question whether BJP government should come or not.
Whenever BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness that inflation was low in the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man got two meals a day.
But when Congress or its supported government was formed, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single leader of Congress, not a single leader of UPA is answering what they have done in the last nine and a half years.
Even the media people of our country are not able to reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They don&#39;t even respond to media people.
Elections are for Lok Sabha, you answer to the public.
Attacking Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, &#39;Questions are being asked to Modi every day. When the public blesses BJP in 2014, then every year it will present the account of its work before the public.
In a democracy, there should be a servant and not a ruler in Delhi.
There cannot be any Nath in Delhi, there should only be slaves.
Congress friends keep releasing balloons every day.
Congress friends, we have given the exam only 10 months ago.
In democracy, it is the people who take the test.

Political parties are getting information about the election code of conduct and following it.
Due to this, the cases of its violations are also decreasing.

He said that the condition of health services and education system in the villages has deteriorated completely.
Till date no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
77-year-old Silvio Berlusconi, the former Prime Minister of Italy, known for his bunga-bunga parties, has married a 28-year-old girl in a very secret manner.
This disclosure has been made by his family friend Marthel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, who has been Prime Minister three times, has married former TV anchor Francesca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francesca met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist in the Forza Italia party.
This is the same Francesca, about whose relationship it was being said that her relationship with Balrusconi was just a show.
Berlusconi&#39;s close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Marthell Polanco has revealed that she too was invited to the secret wedding.
This ceremony took place just three weeks ago.
In the revelations made on Italian Radio 2, when Polanco was asked what would happen if both of them got married, Polanco said that both of them are already married.
This was not a public function.
The wedding took place in the private chapel located in the former Prime Minister&#39;s house.
Apart from this no one can tell anything.
Although she did not go to this wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
Both of them got married about three weeks ago i.e. on 8th or 9th October.
About 8 months ago, he got engaged to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman who was 50 years younger than him.
To avoid embarrassment, Berlusconi had made loneliness the basis behind his decision.

Asaram, who is under judicial custody in the Central Jail here on charges of sexual harassment of a minor student, will celebrate Diwali in jail this time.
Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also accused in the case of raping a girl from Surat.
At the same time, his son Narayan Sai is running away from the police.
And that is why now an arrest warrant has also been issued against him by Gujarat Police.
There is also news coming from Ahmedabad that Asaram&#39;s trustees have also gradually started distancing themselves from Asaram.
Apart from this, now action is also being taken against those ashrams of Asaram which are built illegally or on government land.
We have already told you that Asaram is the owner of more than 400 ashrams.
One of these ashrams is also in New Jersey, America.
Various types of allegations are being made against Asaram and his son.
Despite this, the blind faith of many of his devotees is not ending.
Asaram has influence not only in India but also in America.
Here in India, Asaram may be in jail and devotees are moving away from him, but this is not at all the case in America.
Like before, devotees are still coming to the ashram in New Jersey to have darshan of Asaram.
Scientists have shed further light on the connection between a dog&#39;s tail movements and his mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog&#39;s point of view), while anxious dogs wag their tails more to the left.
But now scientists say that companion dogs can recognize this subtle variation of the tail and react to it.
This study has been published in the journal Current Biology.
Neuroscientist Professor Giorgia Vallartigra, from the University of Trento, said: &quot;It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain are differently involved in responding to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions.&quot;
Here we have tried to see it in other species also.
He reported that in dogs, as in humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for the movements of the left hand and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to unilateral tail wagging by other dogs, researchers monitored the animals as they watched movies of other dogs.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won&#39;t take us much time to understand why their tail wags sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Pro. WellerTiger explained: &quot;We presented the dogs with dog movies – in a realistic version or in silhouette to deal with other confounding issues, and we could see the tail movement and the tail moving more to the left or right. Could have presented the right.&quot;
When the animals saw an emotionless dog wagging its tail to the right (from the dog&#39;s point of view), they remained completely relaxed.
But when he saw the tail change direction and move predominantly to the left (again from the dog&#39;s point of view), his heart rate increased and he appeared restless.
Pro. According to WellerTigera, he does not believe that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they think that dogs have learned through experience which behavior they should be concerned about and which they should not.
He said: &quot;If you&#39;ve met other dogs a number of times, and if they wag their tail consistently, one side is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side represents less friendly behavior, you may have the same experience. Let&#39;s react on that basis.&quot;
The researchers say these findings could provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with better information about animals&#39; emotions.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, visiting fellow at the School of Veterinary Sciences at the University of Bristol, said this is not the first study to investigate whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they saw an aggressive dog, and turned their heads to the right when they saw a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, they reported: &quot;Contrary to the Italian study – when the robot dog&#39;s tail was wagged to the left rather than to the right, the dogs were more likely to approach it rather than become restless.&quot;
He said this difference was because the dogs in the different studies were not perceiving the animals in the movies or the robot dogs as complete dogs.
He explained that studying the way dogs react to real dogs could help.
&quot;While there is considerable evidence from various mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information remains to be learned – and dogs are no exception,&quot; he said. Said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it probably won&#39;t take us long to understand why their tails wag sometimes to one side and sometimes to the other.
New research has revealed that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
Don&#39;t lie to anyone and don&#39;t even think of stealing or cheating.
But as the evening approaches, our mind changes and we leave the ideal aside and start going against the rules.
In this research from Harvard University and David Eccles School of Business of Utah, researchers have given many interesting facts.
According to researchers, in the morning when there is no work stress, we give preference to moral values, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to fatigue or excess pressure.
For this the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of dots on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the dot was more on the left or the right.
The participants were told that if they gave a wrong answer instead of the correct answer, they would be given money.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people on whom the experiment was conducted between 8 to 12 in the morning did not make any mistakes and gave correct answers.
While conducting experiments on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they kept their principles aside and deliberately gave wrong answers.
With this, researchers were able to prove that greed for money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but in the evening we stop paying attention to morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.
The Gate City Circle office, which is earning crores of rupees per day for Punjab State Power Corporation, is running in a ruined building.
In such a situation, all the employees are forced to work in fear of accident.
There is an atmosphere of panic among the working staff due to cement falling from the roofs of this building every day.
Built in 1913 during the British era, this building previously housed the office of the Municipal Corporation.
In the year 1995 the building was handed over to the Electricity Board.
In the name of repairing it, the department is shirking the burden by merely getting it painted.
The condition of the building has become so bad that the employees are afraid to even sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that plaster often falls from the roofs.
In the last one month alone, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
Due to this, a female employee has also been injured.
The JE and the revenue accountant had a narrow escape in this accident.
At present about four hundred and fifty employees work in the building.
This includes 5 XENs including SE, 12 SDOs, 20 junior engineers, 130 clerical staff, 200 technical staff and 20 other staff members.
The situation is that till now nothing has been done by the Powercom officials regarding their security.
Three rooms allotted to JEI located in the building, scooter and cycle stand, two rooms on the upper floor have completely collapsed.
In such a situation, the condition of the building can be easily estimated.
Coulson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson has been accused of &quot;phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face&quot; in an attempt to confirm a purported tip about Charles Clarke&#39;s affair when he was Home Secretary. Used.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis QC. told the Old Bailey that the News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was seeing his &quot;attractive special adviser&quot; Hannah Polby.
The court heard that the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Paulby&#39;s voicemails and &quot;keep an eye on&quot; the male, but Coulson also called and left his voicemail.
Mr. Addis said, &quot;The prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, now editor of NOTW, is not known for standing outside people&#39;s homes and keeping an eye on them, but rather that Let&#39;s see how people react to it.&quot;
He said that N.O.T.W. used three methods to investigate cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face interviews.
The third one included the editors themselves.
It is obvious that he knew about the second method i.e. surveillance, he definitely knew about it.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says, no, we say, &quot;Yes, he absolutely knew&quot;.
Rumors about Clarke&#39;s romantic relationship were discussed in AOTW. It was first reported by the BBC&#39;s Feature Desk when a source sexually interested in Ms Polby said: &quot;Don&#39;t waste your time, she&#39;s with Charles.&quot;
At least three tapes of voicemails were seized from Ms Polby&#39;s phone, from the Mulcair home in August 2006.
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator&#39;s computer that referred to Ms. Polby and her sister as &quot;Project.&quot;
During the period she was being investigated, anonymous phone calls were made to Ms Polby&#39;s grandparents asking for information about her.
During this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup monitored Ms Polby&#39;s comings and goings.
In a voicemail he left on June 18, 2005, Coulson told him: &quot;I&#39;ve got a story we&#39;re planning to run tomorrow that I&#39;d definitely like to talk to Charles about.&quot;
Mr. Addis said Coulson&#39;s involvement in the case was in line with that of other prominent figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had told Mr Coulson about his affair with a married woman. Blunkett while he was handling the case of co-defendant Rebekha Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with others to hack the phones between October 3, 2007 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcair, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted phone hacking.
Encouraged by the resounding win in the last match, when the Indian team faces Australia in the seventh and final ODI at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday, its aim will be to capture the series with a win.
After two consecutive ODI matches were washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI at any cost to stay in the series and its batsmen gave a stellar performance to give it a record win, due to which the team tied the series 2-2. Made equal.
Team India has achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again the responsibility of sailing the team will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak at the moment and even the biggest target is proving to be dwarf in front of it.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in great form, but the team will also have high expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such an opening pair in the form of Rohit and Shikhar who are making the work of other batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he made a brilliant opening partnership and gave Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
Due to the great performance Kohli has shown so far at number three, he is being considered as Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
In fact, many cricket pundits have even declared him better than Sachin.
Virat, who is going to turn 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India has won 16.
His average while chasing is above 80.00 and he has emerged as an excellent finisher.
India&#39;s top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can be harmful for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj had flopped badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even been able to open his account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can act as a &#39;lifeline&#39; for him.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
There is also a demand to include him in the Test team for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen till number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hughes and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
The lack of Mitchell Johnson in bowling could prove costly for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home to prepare for the Ashes series.
The dream of firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market located in the transport area did not come true.
Firecracker traders are stuck in a dilemma after the High Court order.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary firecracker market set up in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses for business in the transport area.
The commission constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court during its visit declared the temporary firecracker market located at Ranjit Avenue unsafe.
Due to lack of proper arrangements there, a fine of Rs 10 lakh was also imposed on the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar.
In its order, the High Court has strongly reprimanded the administrative officials of Amritsar and said that what is the use of such an administration which could not solve even a single problem of the firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not be provided a suitable place in the city.
After this, after making proper security arrangements, the firecracker traders were asked to issue licenses for business in the Jahazgarh market itself.
Even though the firecracker traders became happy after this order, their happiness was spoiled by the police on Friday.
The team of Police&#39;s Arms License Branch reached the firecracker market and set up a counter there to sell the forms.
After this, the conditions given to him were impossible to fulfill in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Incharge of Arms License Branch Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the firecracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore licenses were not issued to firecracker traders.
One day is left for Diwali.
Due to this, firecracker traders are worried.
They are facing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say that if they suffer losses worth crores of rupees, they will file a claim against the district administration.
Angry firecracker traders took out a protest march from Jahazgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
Slogans were raised against the police and district administration.
After this, the business in the temporary firecracker market running in Ranjit Avenue was also closed.

It is true that our work cannot run without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for survival, but it is not in our interest to consider it as everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Trayodashi of Kartik month.
On Dhanteras, Kuber, the god of wealth, and Yamraj, the god of death, are worshipped.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good or bad.
Our feelings towards money are good and bad.
Nothing can be more valuable than the money which is useful for the welfare of humanity, but the money which causes ego has no meaning.
We should earn money for a sacred purpose and spend it only for a sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
There should also be a feeling of spending some part of it on the society, but the tendency of accumulating wealth without any reason or by any means destroys our conscience and personality.
The feeling of charity should always remain in the mind.
Even a part of the money given by you can become the basis of someone&#39;s living.
Many people in the society are living in severe poverty, we all should think about them.
In fact, in the Purushathars of life, equal importance has been given to Artha, Dharma, Kama and Moksha.
Everyone wishes for wealth and fame and according to their efforts they also get wealth and fame.
Only that wealth is durable which is associated with respect.
No matter how rich a criminal becomes, he can neither consume it properly nor be of use to anyone else.
Don&#39;t be jealous if someone else has money.
The true rich person is the one who makes way for wealth to flow into countless hands.
There can be no better use of money than creating employment for others.
One more thing, money is not only in the form of currency.
This would also be in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to become the master of this wealth.
Human population has crossed the figure of 7 billion.
If population growth continues like this, the time will soon come when it will be difficult to get food for every hungry mouth.
According to experts, in the near future humans will have no option but to eat insects.
According to reports, a group of students from Montreal-based McGill University won the Hult Prize this year for their unique project.
He has been given this award for preparing protein rich flour from insects.
As prize money, he has been given an assistance amount of 1 million dollars, so that he can pursue his research and experiments.
In an interview given to ABC News on September 30, the group&#39;s chief student researcher Mohammad Ashor said that now his team will experiment on locusts for food.
This report contains detailed information about edible insects.
A day earlier, the Special Task Force (STF) had revealed fraud in the PMT of 2012.
STF has found irregularities in the roll numbers of 700 students during investigation.
Of these, about 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admission of these students may be cancelled.
After the STF&#39;s revelations, the Medical Education Department has started brainstorming to cancel the admissions of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting to receive the list of all these suspected students from STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved in this.
However, the department is also talking about taking legal advice in this matter.
Departmental officials say that it has been a year since the students took admission in the year 2012, hence it is necessary to take legal advice in this matter.
Since the matter is currently limited to STF investigation, the Medical Education Department officials are not in a position to say anything.
Vyapam Director Tarun Pithore says that if STF submits the list of suspicious students with proof, their admissions will be canceled immediately.
On the other hand, Director Medical Education Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava said that he has not refused to cancel the admission of students if it is found that their admission is fake.
According to STF officials, the fake students included in PMT of year 2012 are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
It is noteworthy that Vyapam had canceled the eligibility of 345 doubtful students who appeared in the PMT examination held in the year 2013.
Out of these 345, the Medical Education Department has so far canceled the admissions of 84.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could end the joy of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing is needed before human trials can begin, which could take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said early signs are positive.
Professor Cornell said: &quot;We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy could ultimately help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit using all the methods available on the market today, but &quot;They found that their addiction to nicotine was much stronger than these existing methods.&quot;
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to deliver genetic information intended to produce anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
The antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from experiencing nicotine cravings.
In the test, vaccinated mice that were later given nicotine continued to perform their normal activities.
But the mice that weren&#39;t given the vaccine &quot;felt good,&quot; a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains, the researchers say.
The experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
It involved giving doses at regular intervals to maintain antibody levels, but that proved costly and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is expected to be high, because the liver will turn the cells into an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if a future human vaccine is completely safe, it could be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes, thereby saving them from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
He said, &quot;They may find that if they start smoking again, they will no longer get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help them kick the habit.
British scientists called the results interesting, but warned that much more research was needed.

Fenton is passionate about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and has two chickens that he cares for.
The way he has started, he will be in the Horse of the Year show before long – and I am confident he will do very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said: &quot;Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his pony.&quot;

I&#39;m sure Fenton&#39;s cute clothes helped him, he really stood out.

It is more than yoga.

Believed in the first freely elected president of Egypt
Mohammed Morsi has been sworn into office, but his victory day may hardly bring an end to the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a &quot;new Egypt&quot; as he took the oath of office as the country&#39;s first freely elected president, replacing Hosni Mubarak who was ousted 16 months ago.
Upon his formal investiture before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi became the Arab world&#39;s first freely elected Islamist president, and Egypt&#39;s fifth head of state since the monarchy was ousted nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath of office before the court&#39;s 18 black-robed judges on the banks of the Nile in a chair that resembled an ancient Egyptian temple.
&quot;We are aspiring for a better future, for a new Egypt and a second republic,&quot; Morsi said during the ceremony, shown live on national television.
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an outlawed organization since its founding and has been the target of previous governments, is among the party&#39;s top leaders in the U.S. Morsi, 60, an engineer trained in Egypt, said that &quot;today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – full freedom, true democracy and stability.&quot;
Hundreds of soldiers and police secured the building and Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Unlike the presidential fanfare seen during the Mubarak era, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president; traffic was also stopped briefly to allow his motorcade to pass through the normally busy The road connects the city center to its southern suburbs.
Morsi, derided as the Brotherhood&#39;s uncharismatic &quot;empty tyre&quot;, enjoyed a boost in personal prestige after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him as the candidate of all, not just Islamists. Who want to complete the work of the 2011 revolution against the Mubarak dictatorship.
&quot;Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern nation,&quot; Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit and red tie, said as he took the oath of office in front of judges seated in a wood-panelled chamber.
Morsi then went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by a military band playing the national anthem while he stood at attention.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi was also present.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people gathered in the lecture hall at the main university there with the slogan &quot;The army and the people are one hand&quot;.
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak&#39;s dictatorial rule last year, and returned presidential powers stripped from the leader by a military council last year. Took an oath to take.
But he bowed to the will of the military by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court rather than the customary oath competent to Parliament, indicating that the struggle for power would continue.
Morsi&#39;s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
You may not believe it but it is true.
Not only this, Mission Road has been named after Municipal Councilor Anjali Kumari.
Actually, Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named this to express its displeasure over some bad roads of the city.
This program was carried out under the leadership of JMM&#39;s Central Secretary Sachchiadananand Pandey.
British police sent extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has sought asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Scotland Yard said it had sent 40-year-old Australian Assange a &quot;surrender notice&quot; requiring him to attend a police station, adding that failure to do so would render him liable to arrest. .
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on sex crimes charges, having exhausted his options under British law after the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm sends them to the U.S. Fearing that he would be handed over to Ecuador, he applied for asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had &quot;sent a surrender notice to Assange, 40, requiring him to attend a police station at a date and time of our choosing.&quot;
He is in breach of his bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on whether the police notice was served.
Assange fears that more than 250,000 U.S. citizens may have access to information on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks. Due to the release of diplomatic cables, he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest case of TDS evasion till date.
The group operator of the mall deducted TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it to the government treasury.
By doing this he kept depositing the TDS money with himself.
On October 17, the investigation team from Mumbai along with the Jaipur investigation team took action against this group.
In the investigation of this episode, it was revealed that this businessman had deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had started income tax survey on this group on Thursday.
Danger of accounts being sealed: About 15 days ago, raid and survey action was taken on the group of this mall operator.
Angered by this action, this businessman has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that he is not yet ready to pay the TDS amount to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them and taking action.
The officials investigating this matter have clarified that in case of non-payment, recovery action will be taken by sealing the accounts.
Oil continued to fall towards $96 per barrel
Oil prices continued to slide on Friday as concerns about oversupply are offset by a report showing China&#39;s power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
Benchmark U.S. crude for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in Europe in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract for the month of October fell 5.8 percent, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
The ample supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said on Wednesday that US supplies increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supply has increased by more than 2.5 million barrels.
But two reports on Chinese manufacturing came Friday that showed a pick-up in activity suggesting strong demand.
That suggests China&#39;s economic recovery may continue to strengthen after growth slowed to a two-decade low of 7.8 percent in the third quarter last quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude used by US refineries, also fell 26 cents to $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
Pawan Bansal, who was surrounded by questions from the opposition at the railway gate, stunned the opposition by saying at one place that he had not looked at anyone&#39;s woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised as to where the woman&#39;s talk came from.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations between a senior BJP leader and a councilor.
After this, turning the matter to the other side, Bansal told the journalists that during the last parliamentary elections, BJP had conspired to lodge a complaint by placing a woman behind him, which could not succeed.
While talking to journalists, Bansal said that CBI has already interrogated him in railway bribery case.
If he was made a witness in the case, then he would have been made so only after thorough investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam he is talking about, he had written a letter to only one needy person.
If this is their crime then they will always continue to commit this kind of crime.
He said that although there was no constitutional right to raise this issue in the Corporation House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as telling about development works is concerned, a list of 15 years of development works will be given to the opposition.
These people cannot even imagine the way Chandigarh is developing or is going to develop.

Before the charges against Jonathan Lord were filed at the Y.M.C.A. Royal Commission hears two employees accused of sexual crimes
Before charges were brought against Caringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the Y.M.C.A. N.S.W. Two employees have been charged with child sex crimes.
But in its statement to the commission it said it had &quot;never encountered any case of child sexual abuse within its organisation&quot;, the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which the Y.M.C.A. An employee of the Y.M.C.A. was charged with child pornography crimes, and another case involving the Y.M.C.A. A Caringbah gym instructor was charged with child sex offenses against children in his care in 1991.
Mr. Gail Furness, Advocate assisting the Commission. Hare said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the Y.M.C.A. The statement that “the YMCA has been subjected to an external audit and they have found the YMCA to be at the forefront in terms of child safety” is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that Y.M.C.A. was notified, and it received the second lowest rating out of four possible ratings in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit in August this year.
Mr. The green that is the Y.M.C.A. admitted that management had failed &quot;including myself&quot; by appointing Lord, and had failed to ensure that staff were up to date with their obligations to report child protection policy breaches. Be clearly aware of.
Earlier this year, Lord Coe, the Y.M.C.A. Was convicted of sex crimes involving 12 children during a two-year stint in the U.S.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that the Y.M.C.A. There was a cultural problem due to which staff did not report child protection violations by Lord.
The staff provided evidence of what they saw as violations, including Lord spending time alone with the children, having them babysit privately, holding them, telling them he loved them and texting them on his mobile phone. Including letting play.
Danielle Ocwell, who was under Lord&#39;s supervision and had asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that the YMCA, which supervised Lord, Caringbah children&#39;s services manager Jacquie Barnatt found him to be &quot;very intimidating and difficult to get along with most of the time&quot;.
C.E.O. Said that it did not accept the employees&#39; evidence that they were not comfortable giving information above their manager.
Rather, he said, his friendship with Lord misled his decision to report on her.
Mr. Hare said he attended the Y.M.C.A. N.S.W. The board provided its perspective that the lesson for the organization from the &quot;Jonathan Lord incident&quot; was &quot;about disinformation.&quot;
Mr. Hare said the YMCA&#39;s decision to have employees sign confidentiality agreements so soon after the allegations came to light. It was organized by Children&#39;s Services General Manager Liam Whiteley.
He said the purpose was to avoid mixing up evidence, but it was &quot;overzealous&quot; and poorly executed.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, a specialist in child sexual exploitation at Griffith University, said that during Jonathan Lord&#39;s tenure between 2099 and 2011, the Y.M.C.A. N.S.W. Was not a secure organization.
He said there were &quot;serious problems&quot; in the recruitment, screening, induction, training and supervision of staff.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Pawnbrokers&#39; silver as middle class feels hardship in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga is giving away her gold bangles, rings and earrings for cash to pay for her daughter&#39;s school fees at a pawnshop at the Bendemeer Shopping Center in Singapore.
“My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it,” said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (2,400 U.S. dollars) as an administrator, and her husband also works, the family&#39;s monthly income remains inadequate.
Indeed, there is similar demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is rising – where Valuemax is conducting its transactions, becoming the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pawning jewelery is not only a way to get cash – S$1,300 in Ms Amirthalinga&#39;s case – but it is also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Pawnbrokers typically charge 17 per cent interest per year in Singapore, which is slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender which has a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring a credit check or proof of salary, and they can provide loans more quickly than banks.
Millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families face hardship due to rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt.
Following five years of strong growth following the global financial disaster, and cheap credit due to easy monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income households are turning to pawnshops to make ends meet as their economies slow. .
This week, ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor&#39;s cited rising household yields, driven primarily by rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
In Asia, Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt to GDP ratio, it said.
Malaysia GDP It ranks highest in this list with 80 percent, whereas in the year 2008 it was 60 percent.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged narrowly from the tech recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a continued export slowdown and a slowdown in consumer demand.
Malaysian Bank, CIMB &quot;The turning point is that with rising prices, people in the middle to lower end [of the income scale] will try to increase their income in every possible way,&quot; said Song Seung-woon, an economist in the United States.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have prompted people to pledge personal assets as they take advantage of the opportunity to cash in on the value of their family jewellery.
Gold accounts for 70 per cent of the items pledged across the city-state&#39;s 200 pawn outlets in Singapore.
People are saying, &quot;The price of gold is looking good, let&#39;s mortgage grandmother&#39;s gold chain, and we will get it back next month.&quot;
Thailand&#39;s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
The pawn business is growing so much that Valuemax, the operator of the outlet in Bendemeer and 15 others like it in Singapore, is planning to expand not only in its neighbourhood, into Malaysia where it has four shops, but also outside Asia. are planning to do, says Yah Lee Ching, executive director of Valuemax.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the S$66 million it raised in its listing on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms Yah says the mortgage not only gets cheaper rates than other lenders, but it also doesn&#39;t directly add to the debt.
She says, “Customers mortgage items they already own, and cashing out personal assets does not add to household debt.
There is increasing social acceptance of pawnbroking for obtaining short-term and secure financial assistance.
It is not that pawnbrokers are used only by financially weak people.
Wealthy individuals in Singapore also use Valuemax outlets to pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can result in cash payouts of up to 60 percent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of the society.
&quot;These include wealthy individuals who need a short-term loan for a business venture or investment, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs,&quot; says Ms Yah.
Sometimes they just need money in a short period of time.
On Dhanteras, people have made a lot of purchases from utensils to gold and silver in the capital.
There has been a 20 to 30 percent increase in such purchases as compared to last year.
There was a crowd of people in jewelery shops in Shimla.
A huge crowd was also seen in the decorated utensils shops from Lower Bazaar to Mall Road.
Although this year there was an eclipse of inflation on such items, people still did not show stinginess in shopping at the auspicious time.
The auspicious time for shopping on Friday was from 7:52 to 10:12 am, from 1:56 to 3:37 am and from 6:17 am to 8:12 am.
During the said three auspicious times, large crowds of people gathered in the suburbs including Shimla for shopping.
People did not find a place to set foot in Shimla Lower Bazaar.
There was a similar crowd in every small and big shop.
In such a situation, shopping on Dhanteras, which is celebrated as Dhantrayodashi, the Trayodashi of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
According to the information, on Thursday, an urbanite named Habibullah Malla was going towards Willow Nursery in Haritara-Sopore.
Suddenly he was attacked by a bear.
He resisted the bear and shouted for help.
By the time people from nearby reached the spot to help him, the bear had badly scratched his face.
People made noise by throwing stones at the bear.
On this he left Habibullah and hid in the nursery.
The villagers took the injured Habibullah to the hospital for treatment.
$325 million rescue package for Taiji&#39;s health
The Federal Government has insisted a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania&#39;s ailing health system comes with strict strings attached that will ensure the state government does not squander the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking &quot;urgent action&quot; to address the ongoing crisis caused by the island state&#39;s aging population, high rates of chronic disease, and system limitations.
The decision on the funding, to be made over four years, was made after consultation with the Government with Tasmania&#39;s independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The Government has introduced an emergency rescue package which we believe will address the particular challenges facing the state,” Ms Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million elective surgery plan.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract surgeries, will help address the backlog of cases.
It also includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Longstation, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and the rollout of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are in line with the best practices I have been told by leading practitioners to improve Tasmania’s health system,” Ms Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that Tasmania&#39;s government will face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state must maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth money, and report each month on where the additional funding is being spent.
A commission of three members will be constituted to ensure service delivery by the state in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said the $325 million would not mean much &quot;unless real reforms are made to get Tasmania&#39;s public health system to a more sustainable level.&quot;
“Yet he praised the government for responding to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May.”
&quot;I am hopeful that the federal aid package will go a long way toward removing state public health systems from the distressed list,&quot; Mr. Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will largely undo the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today&#39;s announcement is &quot;a Band-Aid solution.&quot;
He A.B.C. TV. Said, &quot;The reason we&#39;re here is because the Labor State Government has taken $430 million into its health system.
You cannot consider the state government taking almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth giving $300 million as a day of good news.
Mr Dutton demanded that Ms Plibersek guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
NSA&#39;s revelations about state surveillance fuel corporate fears.
Late on a calm day in August, a German police helicopter buzzed over the US Consulate in Frankfurt, Germany&#39;s financial capital.
On instructions from the Office for the Defense of the Constitution (BfV), Germany&#39;s domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to photograph the roof of the US outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked the BfV to hopefully identify the presence of listening antennas and prompted an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, the US Director of National Intelligence, stressed that the US could use its foreign intelligence capabilities &quot;to steal trade secrets of foreign companies and to help American companies enhance their international competitiveness or enhance their bottom line.&quot; Then do not use it in September.
But ever since Edward Snowden, a contractor turned whistleblower, began revealing his trove of secrets to American surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether the director will keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The final tip came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel&#39;s phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe&#39;s most powerful individuals could be targeted, then surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made transparent the intense cooperation between US intelligence services and companies.
I think it would be feasible to use these data for mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
German companies believe the US has now become almost as big a risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by a consultancy.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that the US obtained the trade secrets of foreign companies for its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the EU&#39;s lack of Internet capabilities. And it should try to reduce its dependence on America.
Business leaders are having doubts about this.
Someone in the German parliament said that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
&quot;That&#39;s no way,&quot; said Hasso Plattner, chairman of German business software company SAP.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, one should not have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal, to cars, to farmers.
But IT industry is everything.
Snowden&#39;s revelations about American technological sophistication and spying reach have come as a blow to some companies that previously believed China was the biggest surveillance threat.
A major change is occurring in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore has become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade association, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider following revelations about the Data Prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-CEO of SAP, says: “We saw a new question that customers didn&#39;t have a year ago – where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it&#39;s physically there? Will it remain within the jurisdiction?
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want their most prized secrets and data stolen and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage occurs is not a surprise.
This has always happened.
&quot;This has been a topic for many years, and fundamentally through the current discussion, nothing has changed,&quot; says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us commercially and industrially and so do we, because it is in the national interest to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders are generally not keen on defense and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, messages have been recording for a long time. Whether leaving one in a business home with a USB stick, or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is unwise to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member at carmaker Audi, says it has a years-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings to prevent them being used as remote listening devices.
Germany&#39;s BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to the risks on trips abroad.
The prepaid mobile phones were then later thrown away.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring, it is a matter of concern.
In Germany, it holds a special place for many companies as global market leaders.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” the BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned about economic spying on its own companies by other countries.
France In February, US national intelligence named China in a second tier of criminals engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, along with Russia and Israel, according to The Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, &quot;the French are the worst
Bernard Squarcini, the former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in an interview: &quot;The services know very well that all countries, even if they cooperate in non-terrorist operations, spy on their allies.&quot;
Americans spy on us commercially and industrially and so do we, because it is in the national interest to protect our businesses.
No one was fooled.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the period of seven days, all the participants were given information about many skills including tent pitching, flag pole etc.
The responsibility of training is being fulfilled with the help of Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
By participating in the inter-religious prayer, all the participants are spreading the feeling of unity.
Camp head Vipin Kumar, State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
State media member Ajay Rai said that he will go on a vigorous campaign there from November 4.
Bhagat will focus himself on the assembly constituencies of Chhattisgarh adjoining Jharkhand.
They are also well aware of these areas.
He will continuously stay in Chhattisgarh till 16th November.
Jharkhandi leaders are in great demand in the election season of Chhattisgarh.
More than two dozen BJP leaders are already gathered there.
Congress had also requested JMM supremo Shibu Soren and Chief Minister Hemant Soren to campaign in favor of the party in Chhattisgarh, which has been accepted by the top leadership of JMM.
JMM has also withdrawn its 10 previously announced candidates from the election field.
JMM has directed the Chhattisgarh State Committee that all the leaders should get involved in the election campaign in favor of Congress.
Screams of despair from Obama voters
I voted for Obama twice expecting change
He says the G.O.P. Obama&#39;s great efforts have been hampered by America&#39;s policy of obstruction
Blockade policy can&#39;t excuse Obamacare website troubles, drone attacks
Obama&#39;s 2008 campaign memoir is a reminder of what could have been
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I&#39;m reading a lot of sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will cheer me up and give me hope during the sadness of second year medical school.
It is titled &quot;Dare to Win&quot;, and is a memoir of Barack Obama&#39;s 2008 presidential campaign.
As I read my patients&#39; prescriptions at night and go to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The election proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took pauses to reflect the historical significance of the moment.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved every newspaper they found.
A group of young visionaries were headed to the White House, and the entire country was ready for change.
When Obama became president in 2008, he had an 82 percent approval rating.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh truth, like coming back from a dream world.
It&#39;s hard to remember those days of hope – they seem a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
Change really happened after I voted for the first time.
Simply put, I couldn&#39;t have imagined any of this.
I credit Obama with many accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to withdrawing our troops from Iraq to ending &quot;don&#39;t ask, don&#39;t tell&quot; to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
Additionally, I believe that partisan opposition has hindered many efforts to move our country forward: including immigration reform, a public option for health care, closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, and more.
But in the countless times in which I have found myself defending the Obama administration in front of colleagues and associates, I have run out of answers that I could give them.
I have reached the point of political despair.
The Republicans&#39; protest policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot answer for the National Security Agency&#39;s collection of data about the private lives of ordinary Americans, nor for the prosecution of people who expose government wrongdoing.
It cannot explain the reason for the murder without trial of American citizen Anwar El Awlaki, nor the shrinking public funds and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
It cannot respond to the report&#39;s findings, which said the White House&#39;s efforts to silence the media were &quot;the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.&quot;
And most recently, it can&#39;t excuse the failure to design a simple website, even three years after the Affordable Care Act was signed into law.
I don&#39;t know if this is what I expected.
If, at age 18, I should have anticipated that the system of governance might contradict the political campaign that brought it forward.
Obviously, elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events, such as the Newtown massacre, will shape our public discourse.
Yet, most of the examples I have given above appear to have been self-selected by the administration.
This thing troubles you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative that did not seem to define his policies or his position.
I thought that a second term for Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have long heard about.
Still, with Obama&#39;s approval rating down to 45 percent this week, that book makes it much harder to return to 2008.
Looking at him reminds me of his vanished promises.
This week I was reading a section of the book that described how Clinton suffered a huge loss in the Pennsylvania primary to Obama.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting he told his subordinates that they needed to get back on track, and remain true to their objectives.
“I want to get my mojo back,” he said.
We must remember who we are.
Today, after five years, Mr. President, I cannot agree with you more.

Monitoring group says Syria has destroyed its ability to make chemical weapons
Syria has destroyed vital equipment for making chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, a monitoring group said Thursday, while fierce fighting erupted in Syria&#39;s north, very close to the site where the poison gas was released. Agents are considered hired.
Also Thursday, the Syrian movement group said some 120,000 people had been killed since Syria&#39;s civil war began nearly three years ago.
This announcement by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has come a day before the deadline of November 1.
The Hague-based organization had ordered Damascus to destroy or &quot;render ineffective&quot; all chemical weapons production facilities and machinery used to mix chemicals into toxic gases and fill munitions.
The completion of the primary phase of destruction is a significant milestone in the ambitious undertaking that aims to destroy all chemical weapons in Damascus by mid-2014.
Destroying the equipment means Syria can no longer make new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the weapons and archives present.
Syria is believed to currently have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came as fighting escalated on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production facility as well as a storage facility.
The Syrian Movement, which keeps track of the death toll through its network, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
He has said that out of this, 61,067 civilians including 6,365 children are included.
The government said 29,954 were members of President Bashar Assad&#39;s military, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said the dead included 2,202 army deserters and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, U.N. estimated that approximately 100,000 people have died in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the figures since then.
Due to this conflict, approximately 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad&#39;s forces have been battling rebels in Safira for weeks, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything specifically.
The war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors, who have the mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war, in a very short timeframe.
OPCW working closely with the United Nations. The statement said its team &quot;is satisfied and has confirmed – and has observed – the destruction of all Syrian declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment.&quot;
It also said, &quot;No further monitoring activities are being planned.&quot;
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of verification work by visiting 21 of the 23 centers declared by Damascus.
Inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centers due to security reasons.
OPCW on Friday It said that according to Syria, the two facilities &quot;have been abandoned and ... the chemical weapons products stored there were transferred to other declared facilities, which have been inspected.&quot;
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira was one of the two centers where the OPCW was working. The inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be approved by the OPCW next month. To be approved by the Executive Committee.
OPCW &quot;I salute the determination and courage you have shown in completing the most challenging mission this organization has ever undertaken,&quot; Ahmet Uzumcu, director general of the monitoring group, said in remarks released by the organization.
The three-year-long civil war is primarily a conflict between Assad&#39;s government and its security forces, which include members of the Alawite sect, which is descended from Shia Islam, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In other developments, Observatory head Rami Abdurrahman said that a massive explosion occurred on Wednesday at an air defense center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
He said that the cause of this explosion is not yet known.
Financial lawsuit filed against Google, Samsung and Huawei in Nortel patent case.
A group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents filed patent lawsuits Thursday against cell phone makers including Google, which it outbid in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The consortium called Rockstar, which had purchased the Noretel patents for $4.5 billion, filed suit in the U.S. in Texas. Samsung Electronics Co. sued for patent infringement in District Court. Ltd., H.T.C. Corporation, Huawei and four other companies have been sued.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of infringing seven patents.
The indictment said the patents also cover technology that matches search terms on the Internet with words from relevant advertising, a core part of Google&#39;s search business.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC And Rockstar representatives could not be immediately contacted.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC All of them make phones that run on Google&#39;s Android operating system, which faces tough competition from Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an opening bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased the bid several times and ultimately offered $4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar over Nortel patents, Google purchased Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, largely due to Motorola&#39;s long list of patents.
The lawsuit states that &quot;Google has infringed, and continues to infringe, despite losing an attempt to acquire the patents-in-suit at auction.&quot;
Rockstar is seeking enhanced damages against Google because it alleges Google infringes its patents by willful intent.
FAA: Airline passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but can&#39;t make calls from cell phones)
Air travelers will be able to use their electronic devices to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from the time they enter the gate until they disembark - but will not be able to talk on their cellphones - Federal Aviation Administration said on Thursday. This is under the highly-anticipated new guidelines issued by the administration.
But travelers should not expect these changes immediately.
At a news conference, the F.A.A. How quickly these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline, said Michael Huerta, an airline administrator.
Airlines are required by the F.A.A. must demonstrate how their aircraft meet the new guidelines, and how they are updating their crewmember training manuals and device storage rules to reflect the guidelines .
F.A.A. has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
F.A.A. &quot;Depending on the status of the plan, we may very soon approve expanded use of the electronic device,&quot; it said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane&#39;s door is closed.
They are expected not to start them until the aircraft reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and permission is given by the Captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the aircraft lands, and not to turn them on until the aircraft has completely landed.
F.A.A. Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic interference can allow their passengers to use the devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, it said.
Most new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gladding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
“When the policy is implemented safely – and we will work closely with airlines to do so – it will be a win-win for both parties,” Glading said in a statement.
We&#39;re tired of feeling like &quot;hall monitors&quot; when it comes to this issue.
But at altitudes below 10,000 feet, connecting to the Internet to surf, exchange emails, send or receive messages, or download data will still be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So you still won&#39;t be able to talk to friends, an online Scrabble-like game, the famous incident of which is when in the year 2011, actor Alec Baldwin was playing on his smartphone while the plane was parked at the gate, and he turned off the device. When he refused to do so, American Airlines removed him from the plane.
And heavy equipment such as laptops will still need to be stored as there will be concern about injury to another person in the cabin if they bounce.
Cellphone calls will also continue to be prohibited during flights.
Regulatory authority over phone calls rests with the Federal Communications Commission, the F.A.A. Not near.
During takeoff and landing of aircraft, F.A.A. May lift restrictions on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rosenken of the National Transportation Safety Board, who told CBS. News&#39; national transportation safety expert, said cell phones are still considered a risk.
&quot;Cell phones are a really serious issue, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation-related devices, but also because they can interfere with cell phone towers when they&#39;re in the air,&quot; Rosenker said. .
The F.A.A. is set to investigate the issue. An industry advisory committee set up by ICICI Bank last month recommended that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
To reduce restrictions on their use, the F.A.A. But the pressure has been increasing in recent years.
Sen. Critics such as Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., have said there is no legitimate safety reason for the prohibition.
These restrictions are becoming more difficult to enforce because of the ubiquitous use of the device.
Some studies also indicate that nearly a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
F.A.A. The airline began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when passengers started using FM radio. There were reports of interference with navigation and communication equipment due to radios and other high technology gadgets of the time being carried.
Newer airline companies are more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also required by the F.A.A. Designed and approved by the FDA to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been asking passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
Huerta said most airlines must meet eligibility criteria for increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today&#39;s electronic devices emit much lower power radio transmissions than electronic devices of previous generations.
For example, in e-readers, there is absolutely nominal transmission during page turning.
But transmissions are stronger when the device is downloading or sending data.
Amazon.com has also been among those advocating for loosening restrictions on device use by travelers.
In 2011, company officials loaded all of their Kindle e-readers onto airlines and flew them to test for problems, but no problems were found.
The F.A.A. regarding the risks associated with use of the device. The advisory committee has expressed mixed feelings.
Douglas Kidd of the National Air Passengers Association said he believes the interference from the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee noted that the only evidence supporting the device&#39;s interference with aircraft systems were reports described by pilots, most of which are very old.
However, committee members recommended that the F.A.A. Allow pilots to order passengers to turn off devices when landing in low visibility conditions.
Travel industry groups have welcomed the changes, calling them common sense conveniences for travelers in the latest era of technology.
U.S. CEO of Travel Association Roger Dow said that we are pleased that the F.A.A. It has been recognized that pleasure traveling is not incompatible with safety and security.
Mick Jagger says he didn&#39;t hit on Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview with an Australian radio show this week, Pawn Star said he sang backing vocals for Jagger&#39;s 2004 song &quot;Old Habits Die Hard&quot;.
Perry said she had dinner with the veteran rocker, and &#39;he hit on me when I was 18.&#39;
&quot;It&#39;s over, and he treats me well,&quot; she said.
A representative for Jagger, 70, said in a statement Thursday that he &quot;categorically denies ever assaulting Katy Perry.&quot;
The representative also said: &quot;Parry is likely referring to someone else out of a misunderstanding of him.&quot;
Perry was one of the singers to guest on the Rolling Stones&#39; tour this year.
His new album &quot;Prism&quot; reached the top spot this week.
BJP National Executive member and chief spokesperson Dr. Jitendra Singh said that Pakistan is working on a new policy of infiltrating terrorists under the guise of this sham peace.
Citing the reports of intelligence agencies, Singh said in a statement issued here on Thursday that Pakistan is trying its best to infiltrate around 2000 terrorists prepared in its training camps.
For this he will never allow peace on the border.
Pakistan is further torn after the failure of the plans of the separatists to worsen the situation on a large scale by provoking the people in Kashmir.
Referring to the visit of separatists to Pakistan last year, the BJP leader said that ISI Chief Lieutenant General Zaheer ul Islam, Lashkar, Hizb chiefs Hafeez Saeed and Saeed Salahudin had assured that terrorism would be fueled in 2014.
Pakistan is seriously engaged in fulfilling this promise.
Murder of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
In such a situation, terming the demand for abolishing the privileges of the army in the state as fatal, the BJP leader said that talking like this till there is permanent peace in the state is also anti-people.
This encourages anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements by leaders that demoralize the army and security forces should be banned.
Apart from this, MP Badal organized Sangat Darshan in village Bhagivander, Bandar Patti, Laleana, Jajal, Phullokhari, Gatwali and Malkana, after listening to the problems of the people, he gave instructions to the officials on the spot to solve them.
The MP also released grants for the development of villages.
He ordered the Panchayat to properly utilize the grants issued for the development of villages, so that the village residents can get facilities. He took stock of the ongoing paddy procurement arrangements in village Bhagivander.
He gave a sewing machine, plants and certificates to 15 girls who had received sewing training.
During this period, 400 Congress and PPP families in village Bhagivander, 35 Congress and PPP families in Laleana and 71 families in village Jal left Congress and PPP and joined Shiromani Akali Dal.
Badal said that due to the parameters set by the Center for the purchase of paddy, the farmers of Punjab are being insulted in the mandis, while the Center has always been showing favoritism to the farmers of Punjab.
DC KK Yadav, SSP Ravcharan Singh Brar, ADC D Sonali Giri, ADC Rajeev Parashar, SDM Shruti Sharma, Talwandi Sabo area incharge Balveer Singh, Sarpanch Kulwant Singh Virk, besides administrative officers of various departments and Akali leaders were present with him.
A recent media report said that NSA stole information from Yahoo and Google&#39;s data centers for spying.
The Washington Post has made this disclosure on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the name of this NSA program was &#39;Muscular&#39;, which it ran in collaboration with its British counter part - GCHQ.
Both agencies stole data passing through the huge fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post, quoting a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, said that more than 18 crore documents were collected in just 30 days of the program&#39;s launch.
These also include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run outside the US and an unnamed telecommunications provider helped the NSA access this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run this program outside America, because court orders are necessary for such operations in America.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied these allegations during a press conference in Washington and said - As far as I know, this never happened.
NSA has always collected all the information within the ambit of law.
NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the US administration has assured that its communications system will not be monitored.
The US has also said that the UN communications system is not monitored.
GM to fix seatback The US Pickup trucks recalled in
U.S. on Friday General Motors Co., according to a filing from auto safety regulators, is recalling its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and G.M.C. Nearly 19,000 trucks have been recalled to fix a defect in the manually operated seatbacks in Sierra pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a flaw in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the seatbacks failed to comply with federal auto safety standards regarding head restraints.
&quot;If the vehicle is struck from behind, the head restraints may not adequately protect the driver, increasing the risk of injury,&quot; according to a notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration&#39;s website.
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
G.M. Trucks began shipping in June and, following a 2009 bankruptcy renewal, became the top U.S. This marks the most significant vehicle launch for the automaker.
G.M. It informed truck owners about the defect in late October.
N.S.T.M.A. The owner could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which disrupted auto sales growth in October.
G.M. Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, were up 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, the company said Friday.
GM in October It sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
On Friday afternoon at the New York Stock Exchange, G.M. There was a rise of 1.4 percent in the shares.

Schools urged to pay more attention to math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students must read at least one Shakespeare play, one 19th-century novel, a Romantic poem, and a post-1914 contemporary British story.
The test will also include &quot;unseen text&quot; to encourage more reading.
A combined English literature and language course will be abolished.
Since 2015, students have been offered a separate GCSE in Languages. and there will be much motivation to choose English Literature as a separate qualification.
The Department for Education will tomorrow release new curricula for English and maths – the first subjects to be radically changed.
It will also make changes to other core subjects next year.
In a separate move, exams regulator Ofqual introduced GCSEs with a new grading system and a reduced syllabus. Will show the changes taking place in the structure of.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that &quot;there was overwhelming consensus that we need to reform our examination system to rebuild public confidence&quot;, adding that &#39;GCS. E. It will be &quot;more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous&quot;.
Studies have found that English schools devote less time to mathematics – 116 hours a year or 3 hours less a week during term time – than most countries.
By comparison, Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said comprehensive mathematics GCSE. - The greater weighting given to subjects in the league tables was likely to encourage schools to provide additional teaching.
This course will focus more on &quot;real world problems&quot; including financial mathematics.
Jet manufacturers&#39; big orders at stake due to seat width dispute.
A race is underway between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights, setting the tone for the showdown ahead of this month&#39;s Dubai Airshow.
The controversy centers on the width of economy class seats on long-haul aircraft, not always the same as those offered by airlines but whose allocated space efficiency has been claimed to be key by the latest jets of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week hopes to set an industry standard for seat width of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the economy cabin, but this should be decided by the airlines, says its chief rival Boeing.
The dispute comes as aircraft manufacturers race to sell larger versions of the twin-engine long-range aircraft from potential orders placed following the 17/21 incidents.
How is the rear section of the aircraft designed – specifically whether seating is 9 or 10. Are mini jumbo jets being designed with claims of greater capacity in mind?
Boeing says it has created the &quot;777
Airbus says that it will compete with the A350 and will carry 350 people in nine seats placed 18 inches apart.
Aircraft giants often make trade strikes on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, with the Airbus 777
Recently it is being seen that whatever may have been the beginning of the marketing war, these three of them are showing it to the financiers together in a restaurant. Will you accept this?
&quot;Boeing is offering long-haul flight in even narrower seats than regional turbos,&quot; said John Leahy, Airbus sales chief.
In terms of change, people may be getting bigger seats, but the way aircraft sit has not changed.
According to US Department of Health data, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 Jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the weight of the average 40- to 49-year-old American male increased by 10 percent.
According to US Health Statistics, the average American male in the 21st century has a waist circumference of 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to the single-seat concept of the 1950s, when the average circumference of the newly named &quot;jet set&quot; was narrower.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission that suggests an additional inch of seat width improves sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing disputed Airbus&#39; seat measurement data, saying it was independent of manufacturers&#39; decisions about how airlines balance fares and amenities.
It also says that research shows that more than the width of a seat depends on the cabin experience.
&quot;It really gives airlines the flexibility they need to do and the things they believe they need to do to be successful,&quot; said Kent Craver, Boeing cabin specialist.
&quot;They don&#39;t want to tell us what benefits them.&quot;
They know their business better than anyone else.
For fliers it&#39;s about elbow room, but for suppliers it&#39;s increasingly an issue in that it can impact income.
The trade behind this dispute is estimated to be worth at least $700 billion. The competition for aircraft orders is enough to tip the scales of American and European exports in the coming decades.
Reuters reported, for the first time in July, whether seat layout is actually the issue in the battle between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent efficiency gains per seat with their new twin-engine design compared to the segment leader, the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 Air.
Boeing&#39;s performance claims depend on the 10-engine 777X1 compared to the original 9-engine 777 design.
The comparison is now used with a profit in unit cost equal to 10.
Kevin Kenniston, Head of Passenger Services for Airbus Europe says &quot;Boeing is doing this to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, and to occupy more seats&quot;.
On the other hand, analysts say the full 10-seat-per-row cabin for the current 777 S suggests many passengers favor the denser layout, which may go along with cheaper fares.
Cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network, said &quot;Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that this business point of Airbus is driven by the threat of the 777 proposition&quot;.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply the seats but are providing a list of suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Jet vendors around the world also take careful measures to investigate this layout competition.
More comfortably, all builders are also offering high-density layouts of jet aircraft for low-cost airlines and regional travel.
Airbus is offering a 10-equal A350 but says it has not been sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus insisted on wider cabin seats on some of its jets in need of more cabin comfort.
Modern jets are unlikely to take off at a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it could detract from the wave of 777

Precocious Puberty: Growing Up Early
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls attain puberty at an earlier age than white girls their age.
Physical changes do not mean puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe obesity outbreak may be a cause of early puberty
Precocious puberty is not as effective in boys
CNN Former correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children&#39;s health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts and growing pubic hair as early as age 7 or 8?
These early physical changes reflect a new trend that is common in American girls, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained at the American Academy of Pediatrics annual conference in Orlando, Florida, this week.
&quot;I spend a lot of time reassuring parents that this doesn&#39;t usually reflect rapid progress toward full puberty,&quot; says Kaplowitz.
Visible signs of development such as the sprouting of breasts, genital and armpit hair, and body odor appear prematurely in girls.
But there has been very little change in the age at menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
&quot;When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years until the first menstruation,&quot; explains Kaplowitz, author of &quot;Precocious Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.&quot; He is also the author of
The most accurate test of pubertal development is time.
There is debate about when puberty begins, but when growth accompanied by breast development occurs before the age of 8 years, it is called &quot;child-adulthood&quot;.
In most cases this process will slow or stop - which can be monitored closely by the pediatrician.
In case of more rapid progression, testing by an endocrinologist may be required to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments to delay premature menstruation and other consequences include: Premature bone aging, which can lead to stunted growth and short stature as an adult.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child&#39;s age, growth rate, and emotional maturity.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs but admits, &quot;Suppressing puberty can increase behavioral issues, and girls may begin to feel isolated from their peers.&quot;
Another major problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their underage daughters to menstruate.
&quot;They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they&#39;re going to maintain hygiene,&quot; Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were symptoms and we had talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She returned from school scared and worried that she was the first among her friends to start menstruating.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of precocious puberty.
Still, there is no consistent evidence to blame hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexually oriented messages in the media.
Boys - just like girls - are experiencing precocious puberty.
Kaplowitz rules that the main cause of this is the prevalence of obesity.
She helped conduct a 2001 study of 6- to 9-year-old girls that linked body fat to the timing of puberty.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors as well.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to attain puberty earlier than white girls their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, patterns of precocious puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although boys are gaining facial and genital hair at an earlier age, the trend toward full puberty is not as pronounced as that of girls.
A.A.P. Other physicians attending the conference echoed the complexities of the topic.
Even in infants and children, acne and pubic hair have become common.
&quot;We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,&quot; says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children&#39;s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician for advice about how to talk to their children.
“This may mean negotiating earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz advised.
If you remain calm your child will usually respond well.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be reassured that even though this is happening prematurely, it is a normal part of life.
Poonch assembly constituency MLA Ejaz Jan inaugurated the water cooler in the Gurudwara complex.
The MLA said that a large number of people keep coming and going to the Gurudwara, but due to lack of proper arrangement for drinking water, a water cooler has been installed here.
With this, people will be able to get cool water during summer days.
Pure plain water will be available during winter season.
Due to which the problem of drinking water for the visiting devotees will be solved.
On this occasion, along with members of the Gurdwara Committee, other people were also present.

The tripods deny being influenced by Obeid.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joey tripodi will be investigated by the state corruption watchdog.
Former NSW Labor Minister Joe tripod has refused to disavow the marine leases policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, the former New South Wales Conservative who had a hidden interest in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday detailed its investigation into whether Mr Obeid lobbied several state ministers to violate the leases policy circulars. Where two restaurants and cafes, owned by Obeid, were renewed without tender after their expiry in August 2005.
The allegations follow evidence given on Thursday by Lynn Ashpoole, the former deputy chief of staff, alleging that Mr tripodi knew of Mr Obeid&#39;s hidden interests? Which is now being investigated.
During years of discussions in 2005 the government had pushed for a public tender to be introduced for the leases.
The lessees were against this and wanted more time.
In 2009 the leases for the circular enterprises, from which Obeid earned $25 million annually, were renewed without the leases being tendered.
Mr Tripathi, who was minister for dargahs from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favor of a public tender.
But he refused to make the change at Mr. Obeid&#39;s request; Mr. Tripodi had requested for a change in the government lease policy.

Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr Tripodi. &quot;Was the matter of development of commercial leasing policy being discussed in the telephone conversation?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; replied Mr. tripodi.
I can&#39;t remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn&#39;t.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obeid.

Outrage over the punishment of the person who planned the bomb blast in Bali
Family members and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 bomb blasts have expressed anger over the punishment given to the mastermind behind the bomb blasts, saying Omar Patek should face the firing squad.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia&#39;s most wanted men, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in manufacturing the explosive device used in the bombings.
If granted parole, he could be released in 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder in the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured scores more.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings at a church in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could have also sought the death penalty for the man known as the &quot;Demolition Man&quot;, notorious as a master bomb maker.
The decision revived painful memories for Perth woman June Courteen, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in the devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Holding back tears, he said that Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have received the same punishment as other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courteney A.A.P. Said, &quot;He should be made to stand before the firing squad.&quot;
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On October 12, 2002, just after 11 pm, The Sari Club was destroyed when a bomb loaded into a van parked outside exploded.
Peter Hughes was in Paddy&#39;s Bar when the suicide bombers detonated a backpack full of explosive material just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a month-long coma as a result of the bombing and &quot;died&quot; three times while on life support.
Mr Hughes says Patek should have received the same sentence as three other members of the Jemmanah Islamiyah terror group responsible for the massacre - Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were given the death penalty four years ago.
In fact, this person should be given the death penalty before anyone else.
Look, there&#39;s no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless others, getting a sentence of 20 years is not enough.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be sentenced.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was finally arrested in January 2011 in Abbottabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. The military killed former al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial the F.B.I. The agent presented evidence that reports showed Patek was in Pakistan to meet with Bill Laden in an effort to re-establish contacts between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
“He didn’t surrender,” Ms. Courteney says.
Even today, he doesn&#39;t really regret causing mental pain to so many people.
The decision comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears shed this year,” Ms Courtin said.
Patek can still appeal its punishment.
When the hotel staff protested, they started fighting.
The drunken MP&#39;s son started a scuffle with RK Singh, younger brother of the hotel owner, who came to his rescue.
Meanwhile many more people came there.
When he tried to catch the young man who was assaulting him, he opened fire with his revolver.
The firing spread sensation in the area.
On this, the hotel staff caught him and informed him and called the police.
Hotel owner Munna Singh reached the police station and lodged a report against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, resident of Berwa Paharpur of Koirana police station in Bhadohi district.
On which the police arrested Anand and seized the revolver.
According to Handia Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor, Pratapgarh, runs a hotel named Raag Darbar on the National Highway.
Anand Pandey reached the hotel at around 8 pm and ordered food.
When there was a delay in cooking, he started abusing, beating and firing.
Anand was under the influence of alcohol and even threatened to kill the hotel staff.
Inspector says that the hotel is near Bhiti village and is adjacent to Bhadohi district.
Cocaine addict lawyer who gave secret information about police investigation to Mr Big jailed
Basharat Ditta, 42, used to provide information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough.
The lawyer felt that people might find out about his secret drug addiction.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
A top defense lawyer who tipped off Mr Big about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would become known was jailed for three years.
Barashat Ditta, 42, provided sensitive confidential information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough regarding an investigation into his drug trafficking activities, after being compromised by his cocaine addiction.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed &quot;Bash&quot; and praised by criminals as &quot;Top Brief&quot;, was arrested at his home in 2011 following a police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he Was represented in previous narcotics trial.
Scarborough, 32, was spotted by officers placing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer&#39;s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out with colleagues at a Law Society dinner.
After traces of cocaine were found in Ditta&#39;s hair, her wallet, and her credit card, the investigation determined that Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of the Class A drug.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to illegally obtain information regarding the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by police at the time as part of a major investigation into a heroin and cocaine ring operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
He was among 32 other people who were jailed after police seized £1.5million worth of heroin and cocaine, and more than £200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, used to provide information to criminals because he was afraid that people would know about his cocaine addiction.
Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, faced disgrace at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of obstructing the course of justice following a three-week trial.
He had admitted cocaine possession at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer&#39;s ordeal began when police, while investigating Scarborough, discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and saw him come into Ditta&#39;s house and put drugs with a purity of more than 60 percent under the lawyer&#39;s bin in a black golf glove.
After the drug bust Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta, who went out for dinner at Ewood Park, the Blackburn Rovers football stadium.
When the lawyer reached the house, he found out that drugs were kept there and that there had been communication between them nine times.
Tests found Ditta was a &quot;regular user&quot; of cocaine after traces of the Class A drug were found in Ditta&#39;s hair, wallet and credit cards, the court heard.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and said their discussions were a matter of &quot;legal privilege&quot;.
During his arrest Ditta attempted to remove several credit cards by taking out his wallet, but they were confiscated, and a sample of his hair was taken.
In police interview he said that he ran an office from his home as well as his workplace, and that his clients would call his home for legal matters.
After the key men arrested revealed what detectives knew about them, the court hearing was told that Ditta had been making phone calls to key people in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented.
Anne White, prosecuting, said: &quot;The criminal lawyer must know best not to break the law.&quot;
Mr Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, becoming too attached to his elite clients.
We&#39;re not talking about the typical drug dealer relationship, but about a dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of their conversations must have been legal without a doubt, since he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond the limits of the lawyer-client relationship.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as possible so that they were able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not bringing respect to his profession but was insulting it.
He became too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be negotiated.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: &quot;If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.&quot; Does.
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: &quot;The moment Mr Ditta began obtaining drugs from organized criminals he transformed himself from a criminal lawyer to a criminal.&quot;
Due to his cocaine addiction, he became highly compromised and highly vulnerable to the motives of leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to obtain vital information relevant to police investigations.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity, and inspire trust and confidence among the public.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this trust and has tried to escape under the guise of his profession.
Mr Ditta was investigated by Lancashire&#39;s Serious and Organized Crime Unit, who has now found him guilty of cocaine possession and three counts of obstructing the course of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing criminals to court.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other gang members were jailed for a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about himself, in which he said that his fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for death row clients in the US, with Muhammad Ali being his dinner guest and inequality being an inspiration for his work.
Bombardier&#39;s profits fall as plane deliveries, orders decline
Canadian airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc. on Thursday reported a 15 percent drop in net profit in the third quarter and contract issues at its train unit, as pressured by lower aircraft orders and deliveries.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or offer an update on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service next September.
Nearly a month and a half after the test aircraft&#39;s first flight, it has been flown just three times, raising questions about whether the testing phase is on track.
The results fell short of forecasts and sent the stock sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, lowered his stock rating to &quot;sector perform&quot; from &quot;outperform&quot; on Thursday. The stock&#39;s upside during the next one or two quarters is limited.
&quot;While weak aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are clearly disappointed by the margin performance in transportation,&quot; Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for the Bombardier CSeries as the flight test program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, the suspicion is that the market will be skeptical of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can catapult it into the low end of a market now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
Potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company&#39;s claims about the new jetliner&#39;s fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but confirmed orders for the CSeries have averaged up to 177.
403 completed orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Baudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order target by the time the first jet came into commercial use.
Officials reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the event was going on as scheduled.
&quot;The test aircraft remained on the ground longer than anticipated,&quot; Baudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground testing and software updates were scheduled during the aircraft&#39;s downtime.
Every manufacturer creates schedules in a different way.
We decided to do a first flight and do an update period and that&#39;s what we did.
That will happen all through the flight schedule.
The second remaining portion of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the remainder following shortly after, the company said
Still, analysts are skeptical customers could begin operating a CSeries aircraft in the first 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it was evaluating the entry-in-service schedule (EIS) and will provide an update in the next few months.
&quot;This slow pace of flight testing – although in line with Bombardier&#39;s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be pushed to Q1/15,&quot; Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Bombardier&#39;s net profit fell to $147million, or 8 cents per share, from $172million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of 10 cents a share and revenue of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world&#39;s fourth-largest aircraft maker said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, down from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
Backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion at September 30, no change from December 31.
&quot;Aerospace results were in line with our guidance, but low order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment,&quot; Baudoin said.
13 percent decline in aerospace revenue to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world&#39;s largest train maker, said revenue in the division was up nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Order backlogs in the transportation unit were approximately $32.6 billion as of September 30, up marginally from December 31.
Margins in the transport division were also affected by execution issues in some large contracts.
Executives said new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which announced Google Inc. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette is joining the board, were also down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil&#39;s Embraer SA, the world&#39;s third-largest commercial aircraft maker and Bombardier&#39;s closest rival, on Thursday reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit.
Parents of intersex kids can choose to have their children &#39;gender indeterminate&#39;
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognize a third gender for children born with ambiguous genitalia.
Newborn babies will no longer be assigned male or female in a stereotypical manner.
The new law does not require parents to declare the gender of such children, but allows them to declare the gender as &#39;undetermined&#39; or &#39;unspecified&#39; on the child&#39;s birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who may make hasty decisions regarding gender-assignment surgery for newborn babies, and combat discrimination against intersex children.
BBC. According to one intersex person who said years later, &quot;I am neither male nor female.&quot;
I will remain a scarred, scarred patch made by doctors.
According to estimates, every year one in 2,000 children is born who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under the umbrella term disorders of sex development, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, gonads (ovaries or testicles), or an abnormally developed penis. Is.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still poorly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex determination cannot be done it is best to use the best information available to assign gender and to avoid surgery if Before such a situation arises, observe the psychological and physical development of the child.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychologist who specializes in gender-identity issues, said Germany&#39;s new law &quot;seems like a good thing.&quot;
Intersex children create moral dilemma.
&quot;Some people are in life-threatening situations that require surgery, but that&#39;s not the case for most children,&quot; he said.
You can assign gender without surgery, and then watch how identity evolves.
The science of knowing how a baby&#39;s gender will develop is not very precise.
No one can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It&#39;s kind of a puzzle why people are gay.
A report filed with the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their condition is not related to sex but to biological makeup, which is neither clearly defined nor defined. In appearance it is neither male nor female, rather it is either a combination of both or neither of the two is clearly defined.
These characteristics may manifest themselves as secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breasts, and height; Primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; Or in chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in the workplace, as well as harassment, violence and discrimination crimes.
There are now special camps for gender non-conforming boys.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark themselves as male, female or &quot;third gender&quot; on their official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby, 52, became the world&#39;s first recognized &quot;genderless&quot; person after winning a legal appeal to keep her lifelong &quot;unspecified&quot; gender status.
According to the Interior Ministry, in addition to M or F, German passports will also have a third designation in the form of X for intersex individuals.
Gender-related issues are still controversial in neighboring France, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition calling for &quot;gender theory&quot; to be withdrawn from school textbooks.
U.S. The German website Catholic Online also opposed the German law, saying, &quot;As the world moves towards a state in which gender is a matter of choice, but sexual activity is not, we cannot help but protect two more pillars of civilization.&quot; Taking you in the opposite direction.&quot;
The mother of a newborn in Maryland also told Baby Zone she would like to see babies&#39; gender assigned at birth.
&quot;Parenting is stressful enough without additional boundaries, especially if you don&#39;t even know what your child&#39;s gender is,&quot; she said on the website about parenting.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites, after the Greek god of beauty who was hermaphrodite.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world treated gender as a slate that could be erased and rewritten.
But many people are now challenging the ethics of surgery, realizing that gender identification is a complex matter, and that sometimes mistakes can be made by doctors who do not understand that children will change their gender as they grow up. But how would you feel about your gender specification?
“In the mid-twentieth century, this was called a “psychiatric emergency,” says Drescher.
When these babies were born, you didn&#39;t call the psychiatrist, you called the surgeon.
The current theory regarding the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia was put forward by Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, who believed that the penis was malleable.
He coined the term &quot;gender identity&quot; and argued that social and environmental cues – including how parents raise a child – interact with a child&#39;s genes and hormones to determine whether he or she identifies as male or female. In form of.
But his theories became controversial in a 1966 case, known as the &quot;John/Joan&quot; case.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis was accidentally removed during circumcision to completely sterilize the child, remove his testicles, and bring him up like a girl.
&quot;Money presented that case as a successful transition case, but that&#39;s not what happened,&quot; Drescher said.
At the age of 15, the child transformed himself back into a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Drescher said some physicians are still &quot;following the same pattern.&quot;
But with the advent of the Internet in the late 1990s, individuals undergoing these penis surgeries began to come out &quot;not happy with the results.&quot;
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who lived in X.Y. Was born with male chromosomes, but his genitalia were ambiguous.
Doctors did not clearly understand whether his penis was small, or whether his clitoris was large, but they were certain that he could never live a &quot;satisfying life&quot; as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce&#39;s external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
&quot;I knew I wasn&#39;t a girl,&quot; she told ABCNews.com.
I wasn&#39;t happy, but it was very difficult to question.
At the age of 18, she was scheduled to have vaginoplasty.
But feeling depressed and feeling something was wrong, she asked for medical records.
This revealed the horrifying truth to him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce D.S.D. He was born with HIV, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone, causing his genitals to not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, took testosterone supplements and had his breasts removed.
Due to the surgery he became infertile.
Today, he works with an organization called the Intersex Project to normalize people&#39;s perceptions of intersex individuals.
But Anne Tamer-Mattis, executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that Germany&#39;s law &quot;invites stigma and stigma.&quot;
&quot;Many activists feel the German law will lead parents to make hasty decisions and designate a child as &#39;undesirable,&#39;&quot; she says.
We fear this will encourage interference.
We feel that instead of waiting, assigning male or female gender is a better process.
But we don&#39;t know how the law will play out, so we can only guess.
Tamar-Matis said her organization supports the Australian law because &quot;it allows adults to identify with a third gender.&quot;
&quot;Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender,&quot; she said.
German law relates to specifying it at birth.
This is not a war to be fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body on their own.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a breast radiologist in Pittsburgh whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany&#39;s law will &quot;give power to both parents and children.&quot;
Baratzy&#39;s daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she has a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Was.
Because her androgen receptor was defective, Katie developed female characteristics.
Her body has a vagina but no uterus or ovaries.
Now 29, Katie is married and a resident in the department of child psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
&quot;This law gives parents the flexibility to not make hasty decisions on their own,&quot; Baratz said.
It provides them time and understanding in proper way by some testing before writing &#39;Male&#39; or &#39;Female&#39;.
This way, you are fine – raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely baby and enjoy him.
We do not need to rush into surgery that cannot be reversed.
&quot;It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from the anxiety that drives them because they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re doing the right thing,&quot; he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he or she is more comfortable with -- and that can be a great thing.
It enables children to take decisions for themselves.
A beautiful expression was presented in accordance with the story of &#39;Ek Aur Dronacharya&#39; showing harmony between the Dwapar era and today&#39;s circumstances.
It was shown under what shackles a Guru is forced to follow the wrong path in today&#39;s context.

Clive Palmer claimed that the P.M. Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest regarding the parental leave scheme because his daughters could become pregnant and take advantage of it.
Mining magnates are in a dispute over paying a $6million carbon tax bill, he has made the claims as he attempts to answer questions about the conflict.
Palmer&#39;s United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining whether carbon and mining taxes are reduced.
But mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott&#39;s daughters could personally benefit from the policies.
Mr. Palmer said &quot;he may have a significant conflict of interest in the matter of paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters become pregnant he will have a direct interest in whether she gets the leave or not.&quot;
Two months after the election, the Election Commission again officially suspended Mr. Palmer has been declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for an overhaul of the election count to speed up the process.
Tony Aott&#39;s daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should election results come two months after we cast our votes?
He said &quot;We must have a better system.&quot;
Why can&#39;t we have a system where we fill in our details on the computer, vote instantly and at 6:30 in the evening we have the results.
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
This is because if someone doesn&#39;t like it then they can delete it?
In today&#39;s times, using a pencil seems completely absurd.
The Electoral Commission is studying options for electronic voting, and recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
59 year old Mr. Palmer said his policies included building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would take his new job &quot;very seriously&quot;.
Public office is for public service.
&quot;We don&#39;t want any reward other than the reward of history for serving the community at this critical time,&quot; he said.
George Kerevan: Euro collapse gives Scots a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that the E.U. An independent Scotland would be required to join as a free travel zone across Europe as a condition of membership.
The stories allude to passport control at Barwick and the barbed wire border at Hadrian&#39;s Walls.
True, the Strathclyde Paper did describe the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although – predictably – not in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that the E.U. Members spend most of their time changing its formal rules as they see fit.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession to Brussels in exchange for getting exactly what it wants from Scotland.
So, again, non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has become solid. I first heard the baseless “freedom means passport control” hoax about 40 years ago.
Yet the point is lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to do Europe&#39;s bidding anyway?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
Here&#39;s the real European news: The great, post-war plan to unify Europe has finally come to a halt.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the E.U. In E.U. Groups dedicated to opposing or abolishing the euro as a common currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany the Eurosceptical Alternative for Germany party – founded just this year – suddenly swept the September federal election, garnering nearly half a million votes, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (equivalent to our own Lib Dems). Formally expelled from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a game-changer.
The strict regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, as well as the constraints imposed on national economies through adherence to the common currency, have led many to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not play much of a role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments – this was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system gave its members fixed currency exchange rates in favor of German exporters – something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself at an inherent productivity disadvantage compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
The deeper European productivity malaise goes beyond ongoing budget and currency problems.
As a result of &quot;green&quot; energy policies imposed by Brussels – providing rebates to French and German energy firms at consumers&#39; expense – European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as in the United States.
This is a crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
An all-wage freeze in the world would also prevent the European petrochemicals industry from getting access to cheaper U.S. oil. Shell cannot protect against being affected by gas.
As a result, there is a growing feeling of rebellion among the people, especially in France, which was once a member of the E.U. Was a major fan of.
After the war, France&#39;s top politicians supported the E.U. It was seen as a way to keep Germany in check, and give Paris equal billing in the world with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing France&#39;s economy to falter.
The result: Marine Le Pen&#39;s right wing, the E.U. The opposition National Front won a recent by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists to third place.
Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labor that they cannot assume that disruption for the left will automatically be gains for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound fame among French whites, the working class?
This team will participate in next year&#39;s E.U. Elections are used to elect the European Parliament in the E.U. The opposition wants to form a united anti-currency group.
If, as is very likely, these elections lead to an E.U. If the opposition parties perform well, this type of group could influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My view is this: Soon Europe will have an E.U. The confluence of anti-currency and general anti-currency sentiment will destroy the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will return to some form of &quot;Europe of (sovereign) nations&quot; that General de Gaulle would support.
Germany and some of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will reset their currencies.
I expect the U.K. to move closer to the U.S. Will keep himself away from this project.
However, Washington&#39;s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can choose to remain (essentially) an area of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – which includes telling Berlin and Brussels to leave at the right time.
I think Scotland could do better in a looser European system provided we kept our own currency.
It would be easier for non-unionized nations to work together with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise we should consider maintaining our economic independence by following the path of Norway.
SNP in Scotland The government has – remarkably – led the most successful anti-austerity political campaign in Europe, winning a surprise majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing the cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labor Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition. Had won.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as it would have to accept austerity rules imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
So, travel agents seemed to you to be from the last century, thank the internet?
Flight Center is bucking this trend.
The company has increased its full year profit forecast, and is expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full year underlying profit before tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with a previous forecast of between $305 million and $315 million.
If the target is met according to current guidance, it will be a 12 to 17 percent increase on the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/12.
Managing director Graham Turner said Flight Center had made a profit of 8 per cent in the first half, and had made a good start to its second half, particularly in Australia and the UK. In non-business travel.
“We have 10 countries that are profitable so far, and many more on track to record full-year earnings before interest and tax contributions,” he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally our most profitable centres.
The leisure business in Australia has regained momentum in the second half, offsetting a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, UK Flight Center&#39;s leisure business also performed well in 2017, while corporate clients were spending less.
U.S. The business recovered its losses in its seasonally weak first half, and is expected to deliver its third consecutive full year of profit.
Flight Center shares were up 3 cents yesterday at $38.20.
Bird airlifted back into the wild to safety from North Sea rig
A bird found dead on a North Sea oil rig has been airlifted from the coast and released back into the wild.
The bird, named Water Rail, was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen before being nursed back to health by the Scottish SPCA at their rescue center in Alloa.
Center manager Colin Seddon said: &quot;This water rail was probably a winter migrant bird from Northern Europe, caught in the strong winds over the North Sea.&quot;
It seems this bird was tired and took shelter on the oil rig.
He further explained: &quot;It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help.&quot;
The water rail was healthy and fit before being released.
Nita Ambani, wife of India&#39;s biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani, is celebrating her 50th birthday on 1 November 2013.
Neeta is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a huge party on this occasion.
Many big Bollywood stars reached Jodhpur to attend this party. Late in the evening of 31st October, many big stars were seen at Mumbai airport to catch a flight to Jodhpur.
These stars include the names of Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapur, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously, when such big names join the party, you can imagine how big this gathering will be.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In fact, contrary to Modi&#39;s claims, during the NDA rule (between 1999 and 2004), during Atal Vihari Vajpayee&#39;s tenure as PM, there was a period when the government did not issue any advertisement against Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002). to be done.
While laying the foundation stone of the 182 meter high &#39;Statue of Unity&#39; statue of Sardar Patel in Kevadiya, Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, &#39;Earlier there was no advertisement on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
Whereas DAVP records show that UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements of Sardar Patel.
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi&#39;s claims, he said that BJP&#39;s PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
UPA was not able to launch any advertisement on Patel in the year 2008.
About which Tiwari said that this happened due to the economic recession that year.
However, the amount spent on advertisements of Sardar Patel is much less than the amount spent every year on the birth anniversaries and death anniversaries of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family.
DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print advertisements for the birth and death anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawahar Lal Nehru.
When Manish Tiwari was asked about this difference, he said, &#39;It should not be seen from the perspective of expenditure on advertising.
Because the cost of advertisement depends on many things, which include things like the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertisement for that year etc.
The real thing is that this shows our dedication, which the people opposing are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.

Supreme Court backs Obama health care law
In a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. The Supreme Court today declared the health care law named after Barack Obama constitutional.

In a letter presented by Mr Snow Dane to the media in Berlin on Friday, the MP said: &quot;Although the results of my efforts are demonstrably positive, my government regards dissent as defection, and offers no defence. &quot;which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with felony charges.&quot;
However, telling the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr Snow Dane said he believed he could persuade the US government to drop the criminal charges against him with the support of the international community.
The charges filed by the US Justice Department include espionage and theft of government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, the German interior minister, told Zeit online: &quot;Mr Snow has been willing to talk to the Dane German authorities, so we have to find ways to make this possible.&quot;

Gazprom&#39;s Alexey Miller calls pipeline the beginning of a new era in Bulgaria
The head of Gazprom said the start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe&#39;s largest energy projects.
&quot;Today a historic event took place: construction began on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the most large-scale and important project in Europe,&quot; Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement Thursday.
The project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia&#39;s export routes to Europe.
A dispute over a contract between Gazprom&#39;s counterpart in Ukraine, where most of Russia&#39;s gas is destined for Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes, officials said.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, an EU member, would mean eliminating &quot;forever&quot; the gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
Once the project is fully operational in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Report: Biden Considers Dumping Obama Campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to The New York Times, President Barack Obama&#39;s closest advisers secretly considered Hillary Clinton as a replacement for Biden on the vice presidential ticket for 2012.
The most notable bombshell of revelations is the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, &quot;Double Down: Change the Game 2012.&quot;
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president&#39;s top advisers conducted &quot;extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011&quot; to learn whether dumping Biden could help Obama&#39;s declining re-election hopes. Is .
According to Times national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book details the efforts of key campaign officials and the White House, including former White House chiefs of staff billed for the name, to find out how former Secretary of State Clinton met the Vice President. What effect does the change have on the pole?
The potential switch was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago campaign infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only a half-dozen of the president&#39;s closest advisers – including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew the change was under consideration.
&quot;Double Down&quot; claims Daley tried to replace Biden despite their personal rapport before ultimately deciding when his information suggested a Clinton ticket would not improve Obama&#39;s chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Clinton with Biden.
&quot;I looked at the whole scene, and one of them was this,&quot; Daley told the newspaper.
You remember, at that time the presidency was in jeopardy so we were like, &quot;Holy Christ, what else are we going to do?&quot;
While Daley described the research as &quot;cautionary&quot;, Martin told CNN&#39;s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made a significant investment in finding out how much the bet would pay off if polled.
&quot;Campaigns don&#39;t spend money like that on polling and focus groups unless they&#39;re seriously considering something,&quot; Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was exploring changes.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss knew about the possible reshuffle.
While Daley said he &quot;doesn&#39;t think the President knew about the potential change&quot;, the former chief of staff acknowledged that it was &quot;possible&quot; that Obama knew.
&quot;Double Down&quot; fixed: Will not answer whether political investigation reached Obama&#39;s desk? Martin explained more.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn&#39;t know about Biden dumping ticket research.
&quot;Possibly,&quot; said Martin.
Today he will meet the families of those killed in the Patna rally last Sunday.
In view of Narendra Modi&#39;s second visit to Patna just a week after the blast, tight security arrangements have been made everywhere.
The police conducted a strict investigation of Modi&#39;s travel route and meeting places.
The police will keep an eye on the people coming to the meetings.
Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and State Police will keep an eye on the security.
Modi&#39;s security cordon will be further tightened.
Meanwhile, questions are also being raised on BJP&#39;s Asthi Kalash Yatra for the people killed in the Patna blast.
State Chief Minister Nitish Kumar alleges that BJP is trying to spoil the atmosphere.
Congress has again given tickets to all the old MLAs.
The list includes 6 old and 2 new faces.
Among the new faces, Nirmala Sapre from Bina assembly constituency of Sagar district and Pratapsingh Lodhi from Jabera assembly constituency of Damoh district have been given a chance.
Three MLAs from Sagar, two from Tikamgarh and one from Chhatarpur have been given tickets again.
As expected, Govind Singh Rajput from Surkhi, Arunoday Choubey from Khurai and Narayan Prajapati from Banda have again been made candidates in Sagar.
In Tikamgarh, ticket has been given to Yadavendra Singh from Tikamgarh, Brijendra Singh Rathore from Prithvipur and Vikram Singh Nati Raja from Rajnagar in Chhatarpur.
All of them are sitting MLAs of these areas.
After the first lists of BJP and Congress, there will be a contest in Bina between new faces from both the parties.
Mahesh Rai of BJP and Nirmala Sapre of Congress are face to face in Bina.
In Prithvipur of Tikamgarh, the current Congress MLA Brijendra-Singh Rathore will face former minister Late. Sunil Nayak&#39;s wife Anita Nayak.
BJP&#39;s Ramakrishna Kusmaria will challenge Rajnagar&#39;s current MLA Vikram Singh Nati Raja.
Khurai MLA Arunoday Choubey and BJP MP Bhupendra Singh are face to face.
Youth BJP leader Parul Sahu is contesting from Surkhi MLA Govind Rajput.
Guillaume Nicloux&#39;s adaptation of Denis Diderot&#39;s novel has great production design and period detail, but it becomes much more than it should have been.
Set in 1760s France, the novel tells the tragic story of a young aristocrat named Suzanne who is sent to a convent by her family members.
When she rebels, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the autocratically sadistic Mother Superior, and becomes the object of sexual attraction to the latter.
The film never goes into sensuality or sensationalism – and that&#39;s the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narrative, it also runs the risk of becoming a boring film for the audience.
Own railway found in U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel
USA One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels has been found between Mexico and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. Officials have described the four feet by three feet tunnel as one of the most complex secret passages ever discovered.
The tunnel is approximately the length of six football pitches zig-zagging between the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA. Connects.
The area is filled with similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide trucks being loaded with drugs.
Officials said the tunnel was closed before any drugs could pass through it.
According to court records, authorities seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the tunnel discovery.
Three men, who authorities said were acting as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to distribute.
If convicted, he could face a punishment ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of the vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following central Mexico&#39;s marijuana harvest in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels to figure out how to get product to consumers faster.
In 2010, authorities found about 700 yards of rail track that stretched from the kitchen of a Tijuana home to a San Diego warehouse.
Greetings were exchanged between the two in the cabinet meeting.
When the meeting ended, Singh praised the Chief Minister&#39;s speech at the Chintan Shivir to counter attack on Narendra Modi.
Regarding his speech he also said that he had no other feelings in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be faced boldly.
The Chief Minister also had the same expression on his face that he took Singh&#39;s speech positively.
It is known that in the Chintan Shivir, Singh had requested the Chief Minister to give respect to the workers and protect them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he had also said that he was ready to be dismissed from the cabinet to express his point.
By the way, after the opinion emerged in the thinking camp, there are chances of fresh thinking in the matter of appointing workers on government posts.
In the camp, State JDU President Vashishtha Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in 20-point committees will be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list is almost ready.
The news is coming that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will inspect the list from his own level.
They will also check whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list or not.
If necessary, there will be a major reshuffle in the list to make room for old and committed workers.
The common allegation of MLAs and MPs is that their opinion was not taken while preparing the nomination list.
The names of people who came much later from other parties have been registered in the list, while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have remained neglected.
Halloween 2013: by the numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I&#39;ve become more of a covetous
I haven&#39;t even had a sign to give out candy from my apartment for the past two years and probably won&#39;t this year.
But statistics show that I&#39;m a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans will actually be celebrating $158 million this Halloween, spending $6.9 billion on candy and costumes and decorations.
One thing that I have always observed is that every Halloween trends.
According to the NRF, apparel spending is estimated to be $1.2 billion of the total expenditure of $6.9 billion.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are all the rage.
Women do not have to do prostitution; Because that&#39;s sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots too.
For men, I hope a lot of zombies, and thanks to the walking dead, space makes up our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be zombies, Batman, robbers and witches.
I guess there&#39;s no harm in being traditional.
Last year we dressed up dogs and surprisingly we were not alone.
According to the NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million on pet apparel.
This is the irony that so many hotdogs are with dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don&#39;t look around.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nilsen company.
Hairy Bars, Lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clarks Bar are worth around £600 million.
It is good news that according to the US Department of Commerce, 41 million Tricks and Tricks are going to be taking part in our neighborhood.
But in reality, we, and those who are joking, will buy 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
One thing we won&#39;t be using during Halloween is candy corn, but they will also sell about 35 million pounds, according to the Confectioners Association.
That&#39;s about 9 billion individual kernels of corn.
It&#39;s a mystery. yet to resolve
Nothing is more elemental than Halloween haunted houses.
The best ones were like, &quot;Terror Behind the Wall (which is actually a prison), &quot;Scream-O-Scream&quot; and &quot;House of Shock.&quot;
In fact, according to American authorities, there are 1,200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue. And those awful nice pictures your friend posts on Facebook and that guy who likes and comments nice face when he sees you.
Finally, let&#39;s talk pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o&#39;-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it&#39;s something we&#39;ve done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the &quot;baby in a pumpkin trend&quot; started just last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards, not living with them.
This year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The slowly fading jack-o&#39;-lantern on your front porch probably hails from Illinois, which grew 542 million pounds of pumpkins this year.
If you&#39;re looking for extra credit, call Tim and Susan Matistas in Napa, Calif., and try to carve their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Some people are born with a silver spoon while some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One name among such personalities is Late. It also comes from Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on 28 December 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third among five siblings.
The five children of the family include Ramaniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the family financially in his childhood itself.
At this time he used to set up a Bhajiya shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited on the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai&#39;s first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he reached Aden city of Yemen in a ship named Cabota.
Here his elder brother Ramaniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem in getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai&#39;s mind.
Therefore, in 1954 he returned to his country.
In 1955, with Rs 500 in his pocket, he reached Mumbai to try his luck.
And his business journey began from here.
From here Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on 6 July 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
Presently his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling his kingdom.
Like their father, today the names of these two brothers are also included among international level businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.

Business for Britain was launched in April with a pledge to bring businesses together and determine how the U.K. The jobs and prosperity creator of the E.U. What changes would you like to see in our relationship with?
To do that, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders, asking them what they think about the E.U. What are his views on Britain&#39;s trade relations with the United States?
You-Gov polled the views of 1,000 business leaders, representative of UK business sizes, sectors and locations.
The findings of this survey may be surprising to many people.
We found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and want to focus on countries that are modernizing and growing, while the E.U. Member states are becoming stagnant.
They want the government to give priority to new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil, and not the EU. remained entangled in the long and arduous process of reforming the mysterious institutions of India.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas ranging from antitrust regulation to excise laws, most business leaders believed that control of these decision-making powers should come back to Westminster.
The general dissatisfaction with the single market was readily apparent, with businesses saying that the costs of Brussels regulation outweighed the benefits of remaining part of Europe&#39;s trading zone – even among giant businesses that traditionally Among those who were in favor of European companies, 40 percent agreed on this point.
Finally, and most tellingly, our survey of business leaders found that an overwhelming majority clearly want Britain to leave the E.U. Instead of politics, we moved forward on the path of trade-based relations and treaty changes.
The findings, which were seen across levels of major business groups, showed that businesses are pushing for &quot;meaningful change&quot; in the U.K. Give back its lost power.
This has a very high cost – the issue of treaty change and getting a better deal for Britain has led in the referendum, the E.U. There was a change of 16 percent votes in favor of remaining in the House.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this survey shows that British businessmen, the E.U. Support their plan to negotiate the terms of Britain&#39;s membership.
It also showed that businessmen, the current balance of power in the U.K. We look forward to renegotiations with a meaningful change in our favor.
A better deal for British businesses is possible, and increasingly inevitable, as the Eurozone moves towards a closed economy and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey findings show For businesses this means a new focused focus on trade and fundamental changes to Brussels&#39; regulation methodology.
Even after post-mortem, the real cause of death of the tigress could not be revealed.
The Forest Department, while giving a vague answer in this matter, is prima facie calling the death of the tigress natural.

Kenya&#39;s press angry over controversial media law
The newspaper challenged the bill as unconstitutional, saying &quot;This is a dreadful place, and it is legitimate to ask: what is to prevent Parliament taking away the independence of the judiciary tomorrow?&quot;
Capital Group – home to Kenya&#39;s most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM. &quot;This law is cruel and extremely punitive, and we reject it,&quot; said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of the company that operates the company.
He said the new media tribunal &quot;will always be biased because it is part of the government&quot; and said imposing restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya&#39;s standing in the global economy.
He said, &quot;I hope that the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject this bill and send it back to the MPs.&quot;
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will give the government &quot;tighter control over the media&quot;, while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been &quot;dealt a severe blow&quot; and described the bill as draconian.
The bill is being passed as part of measures to strengthen national security following the attack by an Islamist gunman at the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenyan media had broadcast security camera footage of squads sent to the scene of the attack, showing them purposefully looting the mall, angering the authorities.
Police chief David Kimao had summoned two journalists and a media person for questioning, although the summons was withdrawn after a media uproar.
Under the new bill, media companies could be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists could be fined up to 10 million Kenyan shillings, with the added risk of being &quot;delisted&quot; or denied official press accreditation.
The tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the violator in case the penalty is not paid.

Kenyan lawmakers have faced public anger in the past.
In May he voted to reject cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and reinstated the top tax-free salary of about 532,000 shillings a month, considered among the highest in the world.
Obama&#39;s health care proposal withdrawn
Amid a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday walked back his oft-repeated, confusing promise that &quot;if you want your health plan, you can keep it.&quot;
With millions of people receiving cancellation notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading American citizens.
Yesterday Obama changed his actual message.
He said in a speech in Boston that &quot;a lot of people who have health insurance, and it&#39;s useful, can keep it.&quot;
Addressing what he called a &quot;storm of news&quot; about the cancellations, Obama urged Americans who received this information to purchase new coverage in the marketplace.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, a comprehensive healthcare plan for the same money or even cheaper than what is being offered.
He said &quot;You&#39;ll get a better deal.&quot;
The administration has said it should be no surprise that the 5 percent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the standards required under the Affordable Care Act. .
&quot;I tell these American citizens straight up, &#39;You deserve better than this,&#39;&quot; Sebelius said in a statement before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace has been &quot;unfortunate.&quot;
“I am just as disappointed and angry as anyone else,” he said.
I want to gain your trust again.
Sebelius angrily uttered this statement, which was captured by a microphone, to a colleague sitting behind her at a House hearing yesterday, following a heated exchange with Republicans. Billy Long, R-Mo., on whether they would need to enroll in Obamacare.
During the hearing, which lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the &quot;architect&quot; of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through Healthcare.gov. Which she is now selling to millions of Americans.

Parents of Georgia teen killed in &#39;freak accident&#39; believe their son was murdered

I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
He said, &quot;My view is that there are environmental reasons for a formal investigation.&quot;
Moore told the reporter that a preliminary autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of &quot;positional asphyxia.&quot;
However, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death, according to Moore.&quot;
He added that &quot;there are a lot of questions that need to be answered or confirmed.&quot;
Moore also said that if he found enough evidence to indict a criminal or conduct a civil rights investigation into Johnson&#39;s death, he would ask the FBI to do so. Will say from.

Love glow-in-the-dark ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world&#39;s first glow-in-the-dark ice cream – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken advantage of the marine animal to develop the ultimate snack.
He got the idea after reading a research paper on jellyfish and convinced scientists in China to use chemical fluorescence to make the protein glow again.
The ice cream will react with the eater&#39;s tongue to raise the pH level of the protein and make the ice cream shine.
Chris says that the ice cream ignites in reaction to the heat of the mouth, meaning the more you lick it, the more it ignites.
Charlie, founder of the Lick Me I&#39;m Delicious ice cream company, said: &quot;It&#39;s incredible stuff but £200 in early production would yield about 2 grams of the stuff&quot;.
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with the neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms the proteins will raise the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We have been testing it for the last few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween as it gives amazing glitter effect
This might be the most expensive ice cream I&#39;ve ever made because jellyfish glitter is four times more expensive than gold.
So each scoop costs me around £140.
Although iska tastes very good.
Charlie&#39;s, the experimental company based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next creation is set to prove even more ambitious.
He said: &quot;I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream.&quot;
This is obviously impossible due to the ice crystals that create refractions on top of the ice cream, but I think we&#39;ll find a way to do it.
Ice cream harnesses the fluorescent properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists

Court blocks NYPD crackdown on stop-and-frisk policy
On Thursday, a federal appeals court blocked changes to the New York Police Department&#39;s stop-and-frisk program that require a judge&#39;s order and removed the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals 2nd Judge Shira Schindler said the judge&#39;s decision will be stayed pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge in the city ruled in August that the way it carried out its program of stopping and interrogating people violated the Constitution.
The city police department has appealed its findings and its remedial orders, including its decision to assign a monitor to help change its policy and the training program associated with it.
The appeals court heard arguments on the requested stay on Tuesday.
The appeals court ruled that because he violated the requirement for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in a series of media interviews that differed from the code of conduct for U.S. judges and the public, he committed wrongdoing, so the judge was removed from the case. Statements made criticizing the court must be publicly held accountable.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of thousands of people by unfairly targeting black and Hispanic men with its stop-and-frisk program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes in policies, training and supervision, including economic reforms, and she has launched a pilot program to test body-worn cameras in some of the campuses where most stops occur. Have ordered.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police stop.
An oral argument on the city&#39;s appeal is scheduled for sometime after March 14, 2014.
The pause and play tactic has been criticized by civil rights advocates.
The pause-and-play policy has been around in some form for decades, but enrollment stops increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, from 684,330 to an all-time high in 2011, mostly from black and Hispanic men. Has been done.
A lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.
Supporters of the changes to the NYPD&#39;s stop-and-frisk program have said that ending inappropriate behavior would create a more reliable and effective police force and could influence other police departments&#39; use of the policy.
Opponents say the changes will reduce police morale, but will not solve a broader problem of crime, wasted money and a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers over the past decade.
The judge noted that stop-and-frisk was not constitutional, but the NYPD had improved its implementation of the stops.
After the general elections, if the new government continues the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through ration, then kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where the sale of kerosene is to be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, there are preparations to stop the sale of kerosene in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some North-Eastern states.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, the decision to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in the states will be taken on two grounds.
The first basis is that electricity connections are being made rapidly in rural areas.
The second basis is LPG connection.
That is, in the states where most of the rural families have been given cooking gas connections, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped.
The Petroleum Ministry has made concrete preparations in this regard.
Sale of PDS kerosene has already stopped in Delhi since October, 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced significantly.
Punjab&#39;s quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilo liters to one lakh kilo litre.
Uttarakhand&#39;s allocation was reduced by 70 percent and Haryana&#39;s kerosene quota was reduced by about 40 percent.
Despite this cut, there has been no news of kerosene shortage from these states.
The Ministry believes that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
At present there is a difference of Rs 37 in the price of PDS kerosene and diesel.
This encourages adulterators.
In the states where sales through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are incurring a loss of more than Rs 39 per liter on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs 31 thousand crore in the year 2013-14.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One might argue that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: nearly a century ago, comedian Frank Fay, who served as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theater on Broadway, Started telling jokes in a conversational manner.
Fey&#39;s quest has expanded over the years, most recently, at the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institution Carolines, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, featuring over sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
&quot;Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolines, and became huge successes, to the point where they became too big to be played in clubs,&quot; says Hirsch.
We created this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year&#39;s event includes appearances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefit for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, &quot;Stand Up for Heroes&quot; featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and other artists including Bill Cosby.
As the festival has expanded, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this year&#39;s festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as Comedy Central, F.X. And shows that air on smaller networks like Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominence with deep-cable sitcoms (FXX&#39;s gleefully raunchy fantasy-football-themed &quot;The League&quot;), and now has his own Comedy Central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot;, although she is best known for her viral video series &quot;Marshall the Shell with Shoes On.&quot;
Other young comedians with diverse voices, including Kroll and Slate (the distinctly despairing Anthony Jeselnik, the satirical, ethnocentric W. Kamau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the highlights of the festival will be an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began his career as a standup comedian, but has become a renowned television and film director, as well as the unofficial comedy historian.
From the year 2005 to 2007, he worked on TV. Hosted the show &quot;Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg&quot; on Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall, in downtown Manhattan.
Steinberg said, &quot;The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of all of Larry&#39;s work.&quot;
He was telling me that, when he was here, he would sometimes go into the alley between two buildings and think to himself that if I ever lost all my money I would stay here.

For 21 years, Georges Weil watched his ailing father go in and out of consciousness, going to and from hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamel Weil was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
Initially he only suffered a broken arm, but an infection developed that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma that affected him for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” says Georges Weil.
If we had money we would have taken my father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Weil continued to take his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals and receive whatever treatment he could.
“It&#39;s not easy,” Weil said.
You leave home at 5 in the morning hoping to be the first one to reach the hospital, but that doesn&#39;t happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people may die while waiting.
The situation did not change much after the death of Well&#39;s father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one physician for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
By comparison, there is one physician for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many Cameroonians cannot afford them.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the private sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country&#39;s healthcare expenditure.
“Their only problem is poverty,” says Weil.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their life.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Vel determined to find some solution to it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a physician, working as a vascular surgeon at the Center Hospital in Yaoundé.
And he started the non-profit organization Eskovim, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped approximately 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 others pile into a van, strap medical supplies to the roof and drive to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck is not on their side.
They have to push the vehicle through rivers and mud more than once.
But when they arrive, they get true hero honors: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
The free medical care in these villages is truly a cause for celebration, and Vel – with his big smile and endless energy – happily joins in.
The next morning his team begins meeting hundreds of patients.
“We&#39;re seeing 500 people on each trip,” Vail said.
They come from up to 60 km away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide different types of medical service.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, donated glasses, or a free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening the team performs simple surgeries with local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, town hall or home; After the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery area, making room for the next person.
The group&#39;s generator lights the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Weil and his volunteers get up early on Sunday mornings to work.
It&#39;s a backbreaking pace, but village musicians usually help keep the crew motivated.
&quot;They keep playing the drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work,&quot; Weil said.
On Sunday his crew returns to town, tired but proud of their work.
The group – which includes Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free surgeries in the last year, and they know their support can change the world for the people they help.
One man said he would be able to go back to work because he received free hernia surgery.
The man said, &quot;This will change my future and that of my family.&quot;
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a hospital surgeon, Wael also works at night in private medical clinics around Yaounde.
He explained that it is his second job that funds 60% of his non-profit&#39;s work; The remaining part is met by private donations.
&quot;I don&#39;t know when they sleep,&quot; said Katie O&#39;Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer with Weil&#39;s group.
They&#39;re always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization so they can keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O&#39;Malley who travel from the United States and Europe to join Well&#39;s expeditions, it&#39;s a hands-on opportunity they might never get in their own countries.
&quot;We&#39;ve been able to gain hands-on experience in surgeries where we help Dr. Weil hold instruments or clean up blood stains,&quot; O&#39;Malley said.
As a second year medical student in the US you will never get the opportunity to do this.
Student volunteers usually pay their own way when they reach Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after reaching Yaounde, the expenses of their stay, travel and instructions are borne by Well.
&quot;There&#39;s no doubt he&#39;s a hero,&quot; says O&#39;Malley.
They give their lives to this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never ending.
For Weil, the nearly identical workload is not a difficulty.
Helping other people live happy lives, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, these are the things that bring him great joy.
“I feel very happy doing this work,” Weil says.
And I think about my father.
I hope they see what I&#39;m doing.
I am doing this to make people laugh, to reduce their pain.

In this regard, a proposal has been sent by ADA to the government, which is going to be approved soon.
In this historical city surrounded by Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, there is no land left on which ADA can make any big residential plan.
In such a situation, it has now decided to make a residential plan beyond Jhunsi in the east, Phaphamau in the north and Naini in the south.
To give a comprehensive shape to this plan, a meeting was held under the chairmanship of District Magistrate Rajashekhar.
ADA has conceived the idea of covering two hundred revenue villages of Phulpur, Soraon and Karchana.
After coming within the limits of ADA, Chaka and Bahadur block will end.
At the same time, half the area of Kaudihar block will also be merged into ADA.
According to ADA Secretary Amarnath Upadhyay, a proposal in this regard has been sent to the government.
ADA wants to take the limits of these Gram Panchayats under its jurisdiction for planning, work on which will start soon.
If this happens then the rising prices of buildings in the city will come down.
There will also be easy availability of housing for the common people.
Soon residential palaces will start coming up in this new area on the lines of Lucknow and Noida.

Mozambique&#39;s security concerns grow as powerful figures clash
With a statue of Mozambique founding President Samora staring down at them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo to chant for peace in a rare public display.
&quot;We want peace back, we want stability,&quot; said Vanessa De Sousa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearful about the future of her country, she changed her corporate attire for a T-shirt emblazoned with &quot;We demand security&quot; in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital&#39;s Independence Square on Thursday.
Clashes between government forces and Ray Namco have been reported almost daily for two weeks, since a peace agreement more than 20 years ago.
Ray Namu was a notorious rebel in the movement initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country&#39;s independent government.
After the 1992 peace accords, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy. The discovery of the Northwest&#39;s vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves could bring in investments of more than $50bn next year from some of the companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil&#39;s Vale, Eni. Is.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political power since 1975, and Rey Namco blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namco says the government started the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofala province, traditionally a Ray Namco stronghold
Attacks on former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked RENAMO bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group&#39;s leader, Fernando Majang, a RENAMO spokesman, told the Financial Times.
Ray blames Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing government soldiers of attacking him.
President Armando Zibuzhan has sought to downplay concerns about instability.
Mr Djibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Mr Dhakama saw himself as a &quot;loser&quot; &quot;whose forces remain to try to prove that he can impose his own decisions on the government.&quot; can do .&quot;
Both Free Limousine and Ray Namco insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr Majang was quoted as saying that the 1992 peace accords were canceled but later became a matter of concern.
He told the FT that meant that the agreement was not being honored by Free Limo.
Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but seriously,” Mr Mazangang said.
Previous talks between the two sides did little to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
&quot;It&#39;s about two big men (Zibuzhan and Dhakama) fighting side by side,&quot; said Joseph Hahn, a lecturer at the Open University of London and a Mozambique expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators and neither of them have been willing to make the kinds of concessions necessary.
Ray Namo, who has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already called for a boycott of the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as a sick movement&#39;s attempt to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
Rey Namo&#39;s share in the polls has been declining since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was formed by a former Rey Namo member, is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr Majang says Mr Jibujanko – who is leaving office at the end of his second term next year – wants to destroy the country&#39;s democracy.
&quot;He doesn&#39;t want multi-party democracy, he doesn&#39;t want to give up the presidency because he doesn&#39;t want peace, doesn&#39;t want transparent elections,&quot; Mr Majang said..
What type of capability Ray Namco has is not made clear, but it appears he has carried out disruptive hit-and-run attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway.
Most of the clashes are in Sofa La province, several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, which hosts the port of Beira that miners, including Rio Tinto and the valley, rely on to export coal.
The Rio Railways suspended its operations for about a week in June following threats of an attack on the Namo Line.
When asked whether Re Namo would be able to repeat the threat or not, Mr Majang was coy.
Re Namo “wanted to warn the international community that things were not going well in Mozambique,” Mr. Majang said.
Government instability adds to frustrations, says Fernando Lima, head of Media Cop, an independent media company. Many are also concerned about corruption, the slow pace of development and a recent spate of kidnappings.
&quot;People think the people responsible for the country&#39;s future are the government and the president, and he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,&quot; he says.
Omar Sultanat, an exhibitionist, says people still want stability.
&quot;Nobody cares about Re Namco and free limos, they just want peace, they want free access to the roads,&quot; he said.
Para military forces have been deployed for security both in the forest and in the city.
The force is keeping an eye on the polling stations of Bastar, Rajnandgaon, Dhamtari.
According to police officers, Naxal operation is going on on the border.
Since it is a Naxal affected area, 80 companies have been deployed in the district.
All the forces have reached their respective areas.
Intelligence has informed about the possibility of Naxalite attack during the elections.
Since then an alert has been issued.
Force searching and Naxal operations have also been increased.
CSP Mohan Dubey said that before the elections, security arrangements have been made tight on the festival.
10-10 paramilitary personnel with arms have been deployed in Manav Mandir Chowk, Bharat Mata Chowk, Basantpur, Jaistambh Chowk, Imam Chowk, Ganj Chowk of the city.
Police patrolling is also continuing.
Also, goons and miscreants are being arrested.
Efforts are being made to ensure that no untoward incident takes place during elections and Diwali.
A case of demanding ransom of Rs 2 lakh from a businessman came to light.
If the money is not paid, the daughter has been threatened.
Efforts are being made to solve the case registered at Hudkeshwar police station with the help of cyber crime cell.
Narendra Bahad (21), resident of Ayodhya Nagar, has an electronics shop.
Between 25th and 29th, someone called his mobile from different mobile numbers.
The caller demanded Rs 2 lakh as ransom.
If he does not give, Narendra has been threatened with death or kidnapping of his daughter.
Narendra did not take this threat seriously at first, but when the series of threats started increasing and the topic came to his daughter studying in class 12th, he got worried.
The family members are in fear.
A complaint was made about this on Thursday.
No clue of the accused has been found yet.
Considering the seriousness of the matter, the help of cyber crime cell is being taken.
&quot;It has been decided to release a postage stamp featuring Sachin&#39;s photo during the pre-match presentation,&quot; MCA said in a statement.

Pope Francis to name first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced Thursday that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, ranking second only to the Pope, and are the ones who select the Pope, so Francis will appoint his first group of individuals who will ultimately help choose his successor.
Currently there are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, cardinals are no longer allowed to participate in the election of the Pope – they fall into the group of 120 &quot;cardinal electors&quot;.
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony to elevate the new cardinals, there would be a meeting of all current cardinals, called a conclave.
&quot;Pope Francis has decided to communicate in advance his decision to hold the February papal council, to make it easier to plan other meetings with the participation of cardinals from different countries of the world,&quot; Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electors was likely to decline by February.
He said the Pope normally names as many cardinals as the number of cardinal electors is below 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Valero said that next year&#39;s papal conclave will be important, because it will be the first papal conclave since Francis&#39;s election in March this year.
At present there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and especially Italy.
He said: “It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance.
Forty percent of South America is Roman Catholic, but their number among cardinals is very small.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis formed the Council of Cardinals – a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
Before this, the Pope used to decide everything on his own.
“Right now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him,” Valero said.
He said it was &quot;possible&quot; that Francis would ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven&#39;t been in this situation before – this is brand new.
Valero said that normally the Pope gives the title of Cardinal to bishops from larger places, but Francis was &quot;a complete surprise – so we don&#39;t know whose name he will announce.&quot;
Foreign workers on 457 visas may undergo &quot;authentication&quot; testing
A &quot;credentialing&quot; test for foreign workers on 457 visas is being considered by the government, as it aims to expand a stricter process.
If adopted, this test would be implemented through a criteria designed to prevent 457s being used to fill unskilled positions in Australia or being secretly transported to family and friends.
A government discussion paper was released today, condemning the government&#39;s rhetoric about foreign workers and former Labor MP M.P. Maxine McCue said today it could infuriate Australia&#39;s neighbours.
He told the America India Institute today that the bombastic rhetoric about &quot;foreigners getting to the end of the queue&quot; and &quot;Australians getting jobs first&quot; is a deeply unpleasant reiteration at a time when unions are demanding a secure labor market. The demand has been made.&quot;
Historically, the implication was that white workers should have been protected – and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if some people in the field saw echoes of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures, which were first considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O&#39;Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday to meet with officials on people smuggling, has implemented five of the recommended changes, while the rest remain under consideration.
If the &quot;genuineness&quot; criterion were adopted, a visa applicant could be examined as to &quot;whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances in which the nominee is a relative or personal associate of the owner of the person sponsoring the visa or the relevant person.&quot; Is&#39;.
Businesses may need to keep count of the number of 457 visa holders, as businesses that previously wanted to sponsor a small number of employees ended up hiring hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man&#39;s distraught nine-year-old son, who had come with him on the trip to Australia, has been consoled by an adult cousin who was on the same ship following his father&#39;s death on Wednesday.
Australian authorities transported the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
