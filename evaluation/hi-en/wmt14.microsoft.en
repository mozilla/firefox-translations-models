RBS suspends two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange division, two people familiar with the matter said, another indication that global scrutiny by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation is proceeding at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in their investigations into the world's largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is exchanged each day.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, who have been suspended as the investigation of the case appears to be a recurrence of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension and confirmed that the bank has received a request for information from regulators this month.
Two weeks ago, the bank said, "Our investigation into this matter is ongoing, and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators." "
Last month, people familiar with the matter said that RBS had sent records of emails and instant messages sent to and received from former traders to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
The trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been relinquished from its current position as European head of forex spot trading at J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in Citi, went on leave last week, while a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been accused of any wrongdoing.
People familiar with the matter said that Mr. Eucher's instant messaging group includes bankers from Barclays and Citigroup.
UBS said it took action against some of its employees this week after the Swiss regulator, FINMA, reported it was investigating suspected foreign exchange market manipulation at several Swiss banks.
At least six authorities globally – the European Commission, FINMA, Switzerland's competition authority VICO, the FCA, the US Department of Justice, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are investigating allegations of collusion by bankers to manipulate currency markets to suit them.
HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted internal investigations, or received requests for information from regulators, people familiar with the matter said.
Banks are closely scrutinizing instant messaging and emails as they have been for many years looking for clues to any wrongdoing.
News about the investigation has caused panic among traders in the sector, who have been among the most profit-making major figures in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing a challenge this year, as low volatility in currencies has reduced opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to brush the matter down, saying that manipulating the huge and highly liquid forex market is an impossible sight, but senior traders say this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that despite the extremely large volume of forex buying and selling, fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means that "you can start influencing the market at a slightly lower ticket price." "
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced this week the retirement of traders from its exchange-traded funds desk in London, which lost about $6 million at the end of last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and is cooperating with its regulators.
Credit Suisse said, "We believe the trader acted alone, and has been controlled. "
A new politics of board changes has begun in municipalities.
Recently, the Trinamool turned into a board in Sainthia municipality in Birbhum district following the defection of Congress-led board councillors.
The change took place after most of the Congress councillors, including the municipal chairman, joined the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors from the CPI(M), CPI and Forward Bloc have also joined the Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy considers this a good sign for the party.
Ten Congress councillors, including Sainthia municipality chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Biplab Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some Left Front councillors, including the CPI(M), have also held the TMC flag.
All of them have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and according to the strength of numbers, the Saithia Municipal Board has also come under the control of Trinamool.
Mr. Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the blueprint for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders from other parties, including the Congress, CPI(M), CPI, and Forward Bloc, are pushing to join the TMC.
Capable leaders from any party are welcome in Trinamool.
The TMC's takeover of the municipal board in Sainthia municipality due to defection of Congress councillors ahead of the November 22 elections to five municipalities is being seen as significant in political circles.
Earlier, there is an example of the TMC capturing the Congress-ruled municipal board in Haldia and Nadia ruled by the Left Front.
When the municipal board in the districts is taken over by the Trinamool due to defections, those who join the party get a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhavan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited about leaders breaking away from other parties and joining Trinamool.
He says that those who break away from any party are welcome in Trinamool.
He claims that people's faith is increasing under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, as a result of which people want to join Trinamool.
However, the main opposition CPI(M) has alleged that lower level leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining the Trinamool Congress terror out of fear.
The CPI(M) is treating the change in the boards of elected local bodies as an attack on democracy.
In a democratic way, any party has the right to expand its base, but questions are bound to arise on the rationale of changing votes for power.

Asaram, who is in jail on charges of sexual assault, once again got disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
Asaram had argued that he was being projected as Dracula who drinks blood of children, but the court rejected his plea to restrain media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order restraining the media from running the story on Asaram saying he has seen every word reported in the media and he does not find any reason to interfere in it.
When they are getting information from police and others, how can we stop them.
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating news about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
But the bench was not impressed by the arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they had other options.
Even before this, the court had rejected Asaram's demand to stop media coverage.
The study has been announced by the British government to increase the benefits of Scotland from the HS2 rail project.
The works by HS2 point to high-speed services in the northern part of Scotland and England, which will start shortly with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would "unite Britain." "
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said they were "excited" to be working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Once the second stage is complete, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The British government, which was in talks with Scottish Transport, instructed HS2 Ltd to consider the possibilities of further improving rail capacity and travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing the possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours or less.
According to Baroness Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is a genuine national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer. "
We are moving forward with HS2, as the benefits will be immense.
Without that, we will face problems relating to the capacity of our rail network.
But it's also about the connectivity of 18 UK cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, that will be better connected because of HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland. "
To the Scottish Government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr Carmichael for Scotland's "clear" return to the HS2 network.
Mr Brown explained: "High-speed rail has the potential to bring huge economic benefits to Scotland, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland as a whole of high speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore keen to work in partnership with the UK Government to examine options to bring high speed rail to Scotland, create a win-win situation and supplement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government already undergoes.
I look forward to reviewing the inquiry report with Ministers of the British Government next year and deciding together on further course of action.
Anti-Terrorism Front National President Maninderjit Singh Bitta will recite Shri Hanuman Chalisa along with 10,000 children at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar Bypass on November 23.

He appreciated the efforts of Shri Hindu Nyayapeeth to connect children with Sanatan culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to give religious education to children including worldly education.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said that it cannot ask the media not to report information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called Dracula in this case.
There are guidelines for reporting in this case but they are not being followed.
On this, the Supreme Court said that you have many more remedies that you can use.
Asaram's counsel said there were thousands of newspapers and 100 news channels across the country but there were two channels in particular, which caused him more trouble.
These people are damaging their image and reporting unilaterally.
Asaram's rights should be protected in this case.
The court refused to restrain the media from reporting but told Asaram's counsel that he had other legal remedies which he could use.
Black box in your car?
While U.S. road planners are struggling with a lack of funds to repair a crumbling highway system, many are looking for a solution in a small black box that neatly fits on the dashboard of your car.
The device, which tracks every mile a motorist travels and transmits that information to authorities, has now become the point of a controversial attempt for Washington and the State Planning Office to renovate an outdated system for financing America's major roads.
Even a boring task like highway planning has suddenly become a matter of intense debate and lively alliances.
You've teamed up with Libertarian environmental groups to rally support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes to keep track of the miles you drive, and possibly the location driven—and then use this information to prepare tax bills.
The tea party is amazed.
The American Civil Liberties Association is also very concerned with raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree on whether to take further action, many states are not waiting.
They are exploring how they can move over the next decade to a system in which drivers pay for every mile they travel on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes for test drives, some of which have GPS. Monitoring is there.
It is really an essential thing for our country.
"It's not a matter of whether we choose or not," says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Government Association, which plans to start tracking every mile motorized in California by 2025.
There is going to be a change in the way we pay taxes.
There is technology to do that.
The main reason this happens is that the nation's highway trust fund is nearly bankrupt, funded by taxes paid by U.S. citizens at gas pumps.
Americans no longer buy as much gas as they used to.
Now in a gallon of gas the car runs more miles than before.
The federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Politicians are reluctant to increase taxes by a single penny because of the high price of gas.
"The gas tax is not exactly affordable," says Lee Munich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota. "
His state recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test a per-mile payment system.
"In the long run, this will serve as the most reasoned option," he says. "
Vonx calls this a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea appeals to urban liberals, because it could lead to, for example, changing taxes to change the way cars drive, which could help reduce congestion and reduce greenhouse gases.
California planners are keen on this system as they develop strategies to meet the goals set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the chairman of the Home Transportation Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (AA-PA) also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent vendors at the Region Foundation are also in favor of pay per mile by the driver.
"It's not just a tax that's going into a blind well," said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the region. "
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been endorsed by two former U.S. Transportation Secretaries who, in their report in 2011, urged Congress to move toward pay per-mile.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million test project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But acting on the concerns of rural lawmakers, who were representing individuals who have to walk a long distance to commute to work or to the city every day, the leadership of the House ended the proposal on the spot.
Yet, many states and cities are moving in this direction on their own.
The most interested is Oregon, which listed 5,000 drivers in the nation's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges instead of gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed initial testing.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is trying out with trucks on a limited basis.
and the I-95 Coalition, which includes 17 state departments of transportation along the Eastern Seaboard (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea did not find support everywhere.
In Nevada, where the device was fitted to the cars of 50 volunteer drivers not long ago, drivers were impatient to think that the government could monitor their every move.
"Concern about Big Brother and other things of the same kind was a major problem," says Alauddin Khan, who directs strategic and performance management at the Nevada Department of Transportation. "
It's not something that people wanted.
As the trial progresses, the ACLU of Nevada is moving forward. "It will be fairly easy to convert these devices into full tracking devices," he warned on its website. "
There is no need to develop vast, unmanageable technology infrastructure that must be stretched to keep a record of everyone's daily movements.
Nevada is one of many States that is making every effort to get affordable technology that allows the State to know how many miles a day a car is running, but not where and at what time.
"If you can do that, people can feel more comfortable," Khan said.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, with drivers having to pay based on their mileage.
But the device it is testing was liked by highway planners because it has GPS. It is not used and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by modem at fixed intervals.
"If you don't track people's movement and their location, they'll be more willing to adopt this approach," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage. "
There have been some major mistakes in these initial state programs.
There are also very less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers different options.
They use GPS. Containing or without GPS You can choose the device.
Or choose not to own any device again, but rather pay a fixed fee based on the average miles that residents of the state decide.
Other places hope that this retention can be sold to concerned citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transportation officials are trying to develop a taxing device that will allow you to pay parking meter fees, provide "pay as you drive" insurance, and build a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists can use to avoid traffic.
The town planning document mentions that "motorists will be attracted to participate in this because of the benefits it brings." "
Although, some transportation planners wonder that perhaps all the discussion over pay by miles is the big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transportation Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said Congress could "very easily" tackle the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust funds by increasing the gas tax.
Additional one-time or annual fees may also be imposed on drivers of hybrids or other cars whose vehicles don't use a lot of gas to pay their fair share.
"Why do you need radical surgery when aspirin can work?" said Randy Rentscheller, the commission's director of legislation and public affairs. "
If we do that, crores of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
Srinagar: Police have reportedly withdrawn the security cover of former minister Ghulam Hassan Khan, who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party.
Khan blamed the state government for the withdrawal, saying his security had been withdrawn due to political reasons.
Ghulam Hassan Khan, who won the 2002 election from Shopian on a PDP ticket, was part of Mufti Muhammad Sayeed's cabinet when he was the chief minister.
Ghulam Hassan Khan said that I have been given security cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, which is called the stronghold of terrorists.
A CRPF security squad headed by a sub-inspector was stationed at my house.
I have bodyguards with me, but on Thursday all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security squad was leaving my house, I spoke to the district deputy commissioner and district SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he will investigate the matter.
When contacted, Inspector General of Police, Kashmir, Abdul Gani Mir, denied knowledge of the matter and said it was a sensitive matter.
I will myself investigate how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been withdrawn.
State Congress chief Prof. Saifuddin Soz said that there is nothing like this in my knowledge.
If Hasan Khan's security has been compromised then it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and coming to Kashmir in next couple of days.
I will discuss the issue with the concerned administration.

CDC issues children's allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines for controlling food allergies in school.
Such guidelines have been issued for the first time by the U.S. government, as the number of school-going children suffering from food allergies continues to rise.
Now the U.S. One in every 20 children in the U.S. has a food allergy.
The CDC found that there has been an 18 per cent increase in cases of food allergy in children between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide information for schools on how to inform teachers and staff about children's food allergies and how to handle them in case of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to stock up on epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen brand auto-injector to combat potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis.
The state assembly recently updated the rules, allowing schools to stock up on epinephrine in greater quantities.
This report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children suffering from allergic reactions.
Children may say "It feels like something is stinging my tongue," "It looks like I have hair on my tongue," or "My tongue is tingling." "
Aircraft electrical equipment regulations will remain in effect in Australia for now
Despite the move to relax equipment regulations in the US, Australian air passengers will have to continue to switch off their tablets and smartphones during takeoffs and landings.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left American airlines open to changing their procedures so that passengers during critical phases of a flight will be able to read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices, provided the devices remain in "aircraft" mode.
Passengers can do this on a lot of flights right now, but many people don't like being unable to access their e-books and so on when they take off and land.
Australian airline companies are considering the decision, which requires much more work to be done by US carriers to meet this requirement, but has indicated that they have no immediate plans to change their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment at critical phases of flight are still in effect in Australia.
"Currently CASA does not have any specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment on aircraft," the authority said, adding, "The issue falls under regulations which require airlines to ensure that safety arrangements are maintained at all times, and that passengers must comply with safety instructions given by cabin crew." "
Virgin, which is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of its in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system, is set to comply with this change, but asked for further action on the regulator's directive.
"We would welcome the review by CASA in terms of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we really feel it will provide a better experience to customers, as we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our planes," the spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would comply with current regulations for now.
"As per our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no immediate plans to change it. "
FAA decisions apply to U.S. alleers.
While we are always interested in regulatory developments that benefit travelers, we will certainly consider the FAA's decision and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary from US airline to US airline and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airline companies will be required to certify that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as amend their manuals, training materials, carry-on baggage programme and passenger briefs.
The FAA said it will "allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at all altitudes after airlines verify the endurance of their aircraft." "
In sparse cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to switch off their equipment during the aircraft landing.
The group has also suggested that heavy equipment should be safely placed under the seat or kept in upper coaches during take-off and landing.
He was accorded a rousing welcome at the airport by select 42 senior leaders of the state BJP.
Modi is in Bihar as part of a consolation yatra organised by the BJP.
The consolation march is an exercise by the BJP to heal the families of those killed in the Patna blasts.
It is noteworthy that on October 27, a total of seven blasts took place one after the other during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna.
The intention of the Indian Mujahideen terrorists, who were involved in the blasts, was to cause a stampede during the rally, so that more casualties would be caused and panic would be created in the state.
That intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyrs by the BJP.
Party leaders have gone on a yatra since Thursday carrying the ashes and urns from his village.
On November 5, the ashes of all of them will be immersed together in the Ganga in Patna.
As part of this journey, a consolation tour is organized.
Its main character is Narendra Modi.
He will visit the villages of those killed in the blasts from 7 am on Saturday morning and meet their families.
During the meeting, he will also hand over a cheque of Rs 5 each to the kin of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial help.
The accused used to open investors' accounts by referring to trading firms and forging them in the name of buying and selling shares.
Probably for the first time in the state, such disclosures have revealed the fraud of crores of rupees.
Who is the leader of the gang, at present, the police have not been able to reach him, but seven people, including the accused who look after his work in the state, have been detained by the police.
The gang operated a fake commodity market in the name of MetaTrader-5.
The company leaders used to take cash from investors and create fake IDs on a fake software.
On trading with this, the shares bought by the investors were visible to the accused.
It even knew which share was bought at what price.
In fact, no shares were bought nor was there any transaction for it, because no demat account of investors was opened and shares were shown false on this fake software.
Police are estimating that hundreds of people have come under the trap of this gang.
Every investor was made to invest two to five lakh rupees in the name of giving profit.
Its main accused Amit Soni has been detained by the Cyber Cell from Jodhpur, while his six other accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohre, it is necessary for any share trading company to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only then can the company get investors to share trading through it.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for him, but this company named MetaTrader-5 was neither associated with any exchange nor did stock trading.
This company bought the server for itself on September 24, 2012 by referring to trading in the name of Wintrade.
Since then, people are being cheated in the name of investment through this company.
At present, eight businessmen from Indore have come forward to complain in the cyber cell.
Even after selling his purchased shares at a profit, his money was not transferred to the account.
On this, he started demanding the amount of profits from the company's leaders.
Investors are even saying that the fake ID given to them always understated the price of their purchased shares.
This price was fixed by the accused at their level.
The company has appointed its CEO and agents in Rajasthan, MP and Maharashtra.
Agents used to advise people to join this company by luring them with more profits.
After this, two lakh rupees were deposited from someone and up to five lakh rupees were deposited from someone.
Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly acknowledged that in some cases U.S. espionage had gone too far.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the intelligence surveillance programme.
Kerry's admission came via video link while addressing the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London.
"I assure you that innocent people are not being victimised in this process," Kerry said.
But in some cases inappropriate methods have been adopted in trying to obtain information.
Meanwhile, a key Congressional committee has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore public confidence that has been hurt by the revelation of mass phone tappings.
The Senate move was welcomed by six US companies, including Google and Yahoo.
The NSA has also broken into the data centers of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the NSA's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reform Bill (FISA) by a 4-11 vote.
The bill mentions several restrictions, including a blanket ban on phone tapping under the American Patriot Act.
Under FISA, the use of data in a deliberate manner and unauthorised collection of data will be considered an offence punishable with a jail term of up to 10 years.
The bill will become law after it is passed by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
"The NSA's phone-recording program is within the law and I believe it made an important contribution to the security of the state," said Senator Dianne Festin, Committee Chairperson.
But despite this, more transparency should be brought in it.
Not only this, the protection of the privacy of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, angered by the revelations of the NSA's Internet surveillance programme, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have come out in support of the legislation.
In a letter to senators, these companies have said that we welcome this proposal of lawmakers to curb the NSA's mass phone recording.
Significantly, the documents released by former CIA employee Edward Snowden exposed the NSA's actions.
There has been a lot of anger in the international community after the NSA revealed that it was monitoring the telephonic conversations of the heads of state of 35 countries, including Germany and France.
In an unexpected confession, John Kerry said that the U.S. Espionage has "inappropriately gone too far"
John Kerry unapologetically admitted this by not allowing the U.S. to overstep his surveillance program. The defensive attitude of softening has indicated that sometimes its espionage "inappropriately goes too far." "
The Minister of State has also admitted that the NSA is not in the process of being implemented. They are also guilty along with Barack Obama in the case of being on an "automatic pilot" as a rebellious disclosure towards informant Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the U.S.
This revelation has made the U.S. The Government has brought diplomatic turmoil in relations with its allies.
Speaking via video link at the Free Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There's no question that the president, me, and others in government were really aware of some of the things that happen to the automatic pilot, because looking back at World War II, and the difficult years of the Cold War,  And then, of course, 9/11 had its potential.
They are in the U.S. He has become the first high-ranking member of government to acknowledge that the U.S. Espionage has crossed its limits but has insisted that no one's rights were abused.
He added that: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately. "
And the President is determined to try to make it clear to the people and is now conducting a thorough review so that no one feels abused.
I assure you that in this process, nothing wrong is happening to innocent people.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that the NSA, however, is not a part of the country's constitution. It was striving for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He further explained that: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow themselves up. "
There is radical extremism in the world, which is determined to kill people and blow them up and attack governments.
So what's the trouble if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We've actually saved the plane from falling, buildings collapsing, and people being killed because we've been able to learn firsthand about the plans of others.
Meanwhile, on Thursday, the chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European Affairs said that the so-called U.S. To help address concerns abroad about espionage, the U.S. Lawmakers will go to Europe, and European countries will be sent to the U.S. We will try to explain the need to continue anti-corruption efforts jointly with the BJP.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connectivity said he spoke this week with members of the European Parliament and others and was concerned about threats by them to cut off participation in anti-terror groups because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
Murphy, the Democrat's first-time election and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington, "The U.S. It is really important for national security interests that European countries are with us in terms of our counter-terrorism efforts.

To make it clear to the European countries that we need to continue to work together to fight terrorism, the NSA is committed to the needs of the European countries. Don't be affected by their anger about the program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations from Europe have prompted the U.S. The U.S. has soured relations with some allies, although the agency's chief said the reports were not entirely accurate, and reflected a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in documents leaked by Snowden suggest that the NSA is not in the case. The US has monitored the cellphones of 34 other top world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended the spying on allied countries, calling it "necessary" and said it was common for both sides to do so.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was arranging a congressional visit that was expected to take place this year, and expressed the hope that the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating lawmakers will be released in the coming days.
He said the itinerary is still being worked out.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip was to improve relations, he said some "impractical relationships" would also have to be sacrificed.
He said that European leaders also have to be honest with their own people, their spying programs used for years.
"Although we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said. "
Meanwhile, this weekend, Mr. Kerry is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland, where he will travel to Syria, Egypt and Iran in the U.S. From strategy to the U.S. They will resolve the hostility about monitoring activities.
NSA blames "internal error" instead of hackers for website crash
"Our website was shut down for a few hours due to some technical deficiency and not hackers as claimed by some people online," the enigmatic National Security Agency said on Friday.
"Tonight NSA.gov was inaccessible for several hours due to an internal error that occurred during a pre-scheduled update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement. "
This problem will be solved this evening.
The claim that this disruption was caused by a distributed denial of service [DDoS] attack is not true.
In the evening, online server trackers had found that the NSA was not in the presence of a man. The website was down for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still inaccessible.
An NSA spokesperson told ABC. He told the news that there was "absolutely no compromise" with the agency's internal, sensitive network.
"No classified information is at risk," the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktivist group has claimed online that they are using DDoS. NSA by attack They are responsible for disrupting the website.
The DDoS attack is designed in such a way that such a high amount of traffic is sent to the target website until the site shuts down due to server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively crude and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly enigmatic NSA, once dubbed "No such agency", has become the subject of discussion and bitter criticism among the general public with the large number of incidents of foreign and domestic espionage programs unfolding in the past months – which are collectively alienated by the former NSA. Secret NSA by contractor Edward Snowden This happened after the files were stolen from the agency and the revelation was made.
Due to such a growing controversy about the agency, there was speculation after tonight's incident that the incident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
A fire brigade was called to rescue a lost puppy at the mouth of a distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker Spaniel Ruby had fled after being hit by a small road collision
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine
Firefighters lowered the front part of the rock with a rope to save the dog from the jaws of death
After the puppy was somehow trapped at the mouth of a distressing mountain 50 feet above the ground, calling firefighters gave him a fortunate life.
Nine-month-old cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away after being hit by a road on Sunday afternoon and spent three days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
Their owner, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, were at the Flappit mine in West Yorkshire to meet Ruby again, and they have thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After he ran away after a minor accident, he searched like a madman for his lost dog, and posted appeals on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker spotted Ruby on a mountain in the quarry at a height of 50 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and lowered Ruby with a rope to rescue her and use a stomach tube to bring her down from the cliff.
Expert technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: 'She was in a critical situation.
It was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet from top and bottom.
She did not make a single movement during the rescue, she remained a stone.
But now she's good.
After that she was eating biscuits.
It was an unusual cry for help.
Rather, it is unbelievable to see the dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has fortunately survived. "
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a vet for a check-up, where she was found to be good except for exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was horrific to see the rescue work"
At first, I couldn't believe how she got there.
It's awesome to have him back in your hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was too tired and fallen, she would definitely fall down.
The fire brigade did a great job.
What they did was really courageous.
We owe them everything, and they were all excellent.
Mr. from Keigali. Alderson also said: "We feared she might fall, but she stayed there. "
The fire brigade did a great job.
I can't believe how he got there.
Due to which the litigants had to suffer.
Addressing the gathering organized on this occasion, Bar Association President Ramesh Singh Negi expressed strong resentment over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said that the increasing attacks on advocates and their families prove that criminals have become fearless.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents that have taken place at different places recently, he said that when the lawyer society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily imagined.
Frontier Airlines will charge carry-on-baggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to store carry-on luggage for passengers on board your aircraft.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging $100 for a carry-on bag and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, though its announcement on Wednesday suggested passengers can carry the entire compartment.
The new carry-on fee is for bags in the overhead bin, therefore, small bags under the seat will nevertheless be free.
Frontier said it will charge $25 if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay until they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to be acquired to take care of passengers charged in advance.
"We don't want to charge that," he said.
Airlines started charging for first and second check bags in 2008.
Passengers who are trying to avoid charges are stuffing as much as they can carry-on baggage that is stationed in the overhead compartment, which means there is often less space in this compartment.
Fees are a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Malley said it's not really about raising new charged money.
It is for the most loyal customers of Frontier that finding the location of the overhead bin has become increasingly difficult.
Passengers buying tickets on the airline's own website do not have to pay this.
That means that the next person in line might pay $100 for an identical bag, while a passenger in line at a frontier gate can get one bag free.
O'Malley said Frontier's website and check-in procedures are being changed to ensure travelers are aware of fees before getting to the gate.
Frontier's new carry-on fee won't start until the summer, although a date hasn't been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that handling baggage costs money, and passengers who want the service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are seeing many as a sign that many airlines are charging enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Most have not even touched carry-on-bag charges, though.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced carry-on charges three years ago, and fellow disoutlets Allegiant Air later launched the charge.
One such fee as well as the other airline is Hungarian Wizz Air, which said airline consultant J. Sorensen, and which tracks add-on fees.
He estimated in the December 2011 report that Spirit brings in a carry-on fee of $50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew in Spirit and expressed surprise at passengers who have encountered unusual carry-on baggage fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was seamless," he said.
I had hoped to grit my teeth and see a fight out at the gate.
"The plane was full and they said it boarded lickety-split."
Frontier is also pursuing Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
Frontier said that passengers who take soda, or juice can keep the entire box, and will give it free coffee for only once.
This will still give the water away.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but after seven months after passengers complained they backed out and followed up with no other major airline being there.
Frontier's move to charge passengers a carry-on fee if they don't purchase directly from the airline is Frontier's latest effort to operate customers per its own website.
Airlines pay online travel vendor Orbitz such $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That's why all airlines have an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from them instead of going through an online travel agency.
Frontier, however, has gone further in this area.
In September many often flew miles giving away half to those customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it slashed the mileage award by 25 percent of the trip meal.
So, a 1000 mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows only passengers to choose their seat in advance when they buy directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and it is losing money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and its flight capacity dropped nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by corporate parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic Airlines are trying to fix the finances of Frontier as part of the sale.
The argument will be "restorated" to the Chinese newspaper
A Chinese newspaper that made a front-page appeal to release a reporter convicted of defamation will be restored, a press regulator has said.
Guangzhou-based newspaper New Express made a rare public plea for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken bribes to write fabricated stories about a partially owned state company.
The regulator said New Express now has to undergo a "full revamp".
The "reform" order came from the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Administration.
"A preliminary investigation showed that Yangcheng Evening News Group's New Express had published a lot of false news about the listed company ZoomLon in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
"The editorial management of New Express was in disarray," the regulator said in a statement. "
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative penalty by revoking the license of the reporter of Chen Yongzhou".
It had "directed Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete revamp of New Express, investigate those responsible for it in New Express, and recommended immediate revamping of New Express's leadership team." "
Mr. Chen wrote several articles in the New Express blaming financial irregularities at a construction equipment company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front page appeals for his release, and said he was not in charge of Mr. Supports Chen's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen admitted to appearing on state television, writing and publishing false stories for money.
He also spoke on state broadcaster CCTV. "In this case, I have damaged ZoomLion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to win people's trust. "
I did this mainly because I greed for money and fame.
I have realised my mistakes.
Mr. Following Chen's apology, New Express issued a front-page apology, saying it had failed to properly investigate their report.
In the recent past, many high-profile suspects have appeared on TV. The circulating blame is of acknowledgement.
Experts say coercive convictions are sometimes enforced, despite a law later this year that prohibited authorities from forcing a person to plead guilty.

The players of this team keep making new records in the Test and now their status is gradually increasing in ODIs as well.
A great example of this was also seen on Thursday when Bangladesh crushed the New Zealand team in the ODI series and won the title by taking an unbeatable lead.
With the sharp bowling of Sohag Ghazi and Mashrafe Mortaza, Bangladesh defeated New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI match and took an unbeatable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive win against New Zealand in ODI cricket.
Earlier, New Zealand lost the series 0–4 in the 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing Bangladesh's target of 248 runs, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals in front of the spin of Gazi (34/3) and the stormy bowling of Mortaza (43/3), which reduced the team to 207 runs in 46.4 overs.
For New Zealand, Ross Taylor scored the highest 45, while Corey Anderson scored 37 runs.
Kyle Mills contributed an unbeaten 27, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but none of the team's batsmen could convert a good start into a big innings, which led to the team to face defeat.
Earlier, Bangladesh's team was dismissed for 247 runs in 49 overs despite the half-century of Tamim Iqbal (58).
Anderson and James Neesham together took eight wickets.
Anderson took four for 40, while Neesham took four wickets for 53 runs.
Tamim has become Bangladesh's highest run-scorer in ODIs.
Tamim, who left behind Shakib Al Hasan, has scored 3702 runs in 124 matches.
The third and final match of the series will be played at Fatullah on Sunday.
The police have recovered fake registry, fake seals, laptops and photocopies of the fake registry from the possession of the accused.
Moti Nagar police have registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said that the arrested accused have been identified as Rajiv Agarwal alias Bintu of Chandra Nagar in Haibowal, Kamal Krishna Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gaggi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh of the registrar's office (East) escaped from the spot.
According to the police, the accused, along with Balbir Singh, clerk and recordkeeper of the registrar's office, used to take out papers from the records of vacant and old lands and then buy new stamp papers and prepare a fake registry on them.
Not only this, after that the original registry was disappeared and put in the fake registry record.
After this, the accused used to sell the land for crores of rupees on fake papers.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land was left to the police and administration.
The accused who prepared the fake registry kept a special eye on the lands of NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the NRIG's land.
Therefore, it is easy to prepare a fake registry of those lands and sell them.
Police Commissioner Gill said that during interrogation, the accused told that they have prepared about 150 fake registries so far.
According to the police, the kingpin of the gang, Rajiv, has already been booked in cases of cheating and theft.
Children should be taught "as models for a way of authoring life", myths and legends.
The stories of Thor could show "there is no match for all the subtle tricks in brutal strength," while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
To teach many of the myths "exceptionally even remotely wild, and in some cases even pornographic and it would not be appropriate to be taught in schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated "careful selection" among age-appropriate actions.
"I find it surprising, in America, myth and folklore already have a part in education," he said.
I've been advocating this as a plan for twenty years.
He called writers and teachers "more enlightening" and that "is a new twist" for children, with messages being "presented" into entertaining stories.
Cross Lee Holland, who translated from Anglo Saxon to Beowulf with Norwegian myths and British folk tales who authored the book Penguin, said: "You may have a lot of intentions but would be better at keeping it out of sight."
Perhaps the big difference between writing an adult writer for a progeny and writing an adult writer for an adult requires some sense of hope.
But because everything has to simplify or come to a happy end, but it is an innate sense of good and evil.
And that should be submitted, rather than told through a story.
Old base is not showing.
BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital, on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election rally.
Modi said on this occasion, "In many states of the country and at the center, sometimes coalition governments were formed, sometimes Congress, sometimes communists and sometimes BJP government was formed.
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits, economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
Which party did what?
If there is a comparative result, then the question in front of the country will not be whether the BJP government should come or not.
Whenever the BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness that inflation was low in the governments of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man used to get food two times.
But when the Congress or its support government was formed, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single leader of the Congress, not a single leader of the UPA is answering what he has done in nine-and-a-half years.
Even the media in our country is not able to reach them.
Congress has become arrogant.
They don't even respond to the media.
The elections are for Lok Sabha, you answer the public.
Modi attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal and said, "Questions are being asked to Modi every day. When the people bless the BJP in 2014, then every year they will present the account of their work before the public.
In a democracy, servants, not rulers, should sit in Delhi.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends keep releasing balloons every day.
Congress friends, we have given the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, it is the people who take the test.

Due to which the cases of violation of code of conduct have started decreasing now.
Till October 21, 313 cases were registered against various political parties since the model code of conduct came into force on October 4.

Political parties are getting information about the election code of conduct and following it.
This is also reducing the cases of violation.
Sood said that the cleanliness system in the city, street lights have completely failed.

But no steps are being taken to invest money on the development of the city.
VK Sood said that the problem of dumping ground is the most serious.
Due to the construction of a dumping ground in Sector 23, people living in trans-Ghaggar sectors are forced to live a hellish life for the last several years.
Municipal Corporation officials have been talking about shifting the dumping ground in village Jhuriwala for the last several years, but the people of Barwala area are already facing a serious problem of flies.
He said that the condition of health services and education system in villages has completely deteriorated.
Till date, no work has been started to provide facilities to the people in rural areas.
77-year-old former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, known for bunga-bunga parties, has secretly married a 28-year-old girl.
This has been revealed by his family friend Marthel Polanco.
According to him, Berlusconi, a three-time prime minister, has married former TV anchor Francisca Pascal in his private chapel.
Francisca met Balusconi when she was a teenage activist at the Forza Italia party.
This is the same Francisca, whose relationship was said to be just a sham with Balrusconi.
Berlusconi's close friend and Bunga-Bunga girl Marthel Polanco has revealed that she too was invited to this secret wedding.
The ceremony took place three weeks ago.
When asked in the revelation on Italian Radio 2 what would happen if the two got married, Polanco said they were already married.
It was not a public function.
The wedding took place in a private chapel in the former prime minister's house.
Apart from this, no one can tell anything.
However, she did not attend this wedding.
He has sent his congratulations to the newlyweds.
Both of them got married about three weeks ago i.e. on October 8 or 9.
About 8 months ago, he got engaged to Francesca Pascal, a 28-year-old woman 50 years younger than him.
To avoid the gritty, Berlusconi had based loneliness on the basis of his decision.

Asaram, who is currently lodged in the Central Jail here on charges of sexually assaulting a minor student, will celebrate Diwali this year in jail.
Besides Jodhpur, Asaram is also an accused in the Surat girl rape case.
At the same time, his son Narayan Sai has been running away from the police.
And that is why now an arrest warrant has also been issued by the Gujarat Police against him.
It is also being reported from Ahmedabad that Asaram's trustees have also started to distance themselves from Asaram gradually.
Apart from this, action is also being taken against those ashrams of Asaram, which are illegally constructed or on government land.
We have already told you that Asaram owns more than 400 ashrams.
One of them is also in New Jersey, USA.
Asaram and his son are facing various types of allegations.
Even on this, the blind faith of many of his devotees is not ending.
Asaram has equal dominance not only in India but also in America.
Here in India, Asaram may be in jail and devotees are getting away from him, but this is not the case in America at all.
In the ashram in New Jersey, devotees are still coming to the ashram as before.
Scientists have shed further light on the subject of what is the relationship between the movements of a dog's tail and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while restless dogs wag their tail more primarily to the left.
But now scientists say companion dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of tail and react to it.
The study was published in the journal Current Biology.
Professor Georgia Wellertigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is well known in humans that the left and right sides of the brain are involved differently in the stimuli that generates positive or negative emotions. "
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
They reported that in dogs, like humans, the right side of the brain was responsible for left-hand movements and reverse movements, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotion.
To learn more about how dogs react to unilateral tail wagging by other dogs, the researchers monitored animals watching movies of other dogs.
They measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
Pro. Vellatigra reported: "We introduced the dogs to films of dogs – in a realistic version or in silhouettes to deal with other issues that might be confusing, and we could see the movement of the tail and render the tail more left or right. "
When the animals saw an emotionless dog wagging its tail to the right (out of sight of the dog), they were completely relaxed.
But when he saw the tail changing direction, mainly to the left (again from the dog's sight), his heartbeat increased and he looked restless.
Pro. According to Vellartigara, he does not think the dogs were consciously communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they think the dogs have learned from their own experience what movements they should be concerned about and what they shouldn't.
He said: "If you have met other dogs many times, and if they wag their tail consistently to one side it is related to more friendly behaviour, and the right side presents less friendly behaviour, you react based on the same experience." "
The findings could provide owners, veterinarians and trainers with a better understanding of animals' emotions, the researchers said.
John Bradshaw, an expert on dog behaviour, who is a guest fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, explained that this is not the first study to examine whether the left or right side is important for dogs.
Last year, a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog and turn their head to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, they reported: "Contrary to the Italian study – when the robotic dog's tail shook to the left rather than the right, the dogs were more likely to approach rather than be restless." "
He said the difference was because dogs in various studies did not fully understand animals or robot dogs in movies.
He explained that studying how dogs react to real dogs can help.
"While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that the two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information has yet to be obtained – and dogs are not an exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take us long to understand why their tail sometimes moves to one side and sometimes to the other.
New research has shown that we work with full honesty and dedication in the morning.
Do not lie to anyone and do not think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal aside and start walking against the rule.
In this research from Harvard University and Uto's David Eccles School of Business, researchers have given many interesting facts.
According to researchers, we prefer moral values without work stress in the morning, but in the evening, honesty decreases due to fatigue or more pressure.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of dots on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point is more on the left or the right.
Participants were told that they would be paid if they gave wrong answers instead of correct answers.
In this experiment, it was seen that between 8 and 12 in the morning, the people who were experimented did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
At the same time, while experimenting on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that they deliberately gave wrong answers by ignoring their principles.
With this, the researchers were able to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not affect our honesty, but in the evening, we stop paying attention to morality.
This research has been published in the latest issue of Psychological Science.

Coulson used phone hacking to confirm the secret information
Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World, has been charged with using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to corroborate a so-called secret information about Charles Clarke's affair when he was Home Secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Addis Q.C. The News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clark was meeting his "charming special adviser" Hannah Paulby, the Old Bailey told the Old Bailey.
The court was told that the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulcair to hack Paulby's voicemail and "keep an eye" on it, but Coulson called and left her voicemail.
Mr. Addis said that "the prosecution suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is currently on NOTW. He is not known for standing outside people's homes and keeping an eye on them, but he puts articles in front of people, see how people react to them. "
He said that NOTW The CBI used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face.
The third one consisted of the editors themselves.
Obviously, he knew about the other way, that is, surveillance, he certainly knew.
What about the first one?
Did he know about phone hacking?
He says no, we say "yes, he knew exactly".
Rumors about Clark's romance have been diverted to AOTW. It was first introduced by the features desk of Ms. Paulby, when a sexually inclined source in Ms. Paulby said: "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles." "
From home in August 2006 to Mulcair, tapes of voicemail were seized at least three times from Ms. Paulby's phone.
Investigators also found entries on the private investigator's computer that referred to Ms. Paulby and her sister as "Project."
During the period they were being investigated, Ms. Paulby's grandparents were made anonymous calls asking for information about her.
Former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Ms. Paulby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson told him via a voicemail: "I've got a story we plan to run tomorrow, which I'd certainly like to talk to Charles about. "
Mr. Addis said Coulson's involvement in the case was similar to the pattern of other important persons, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The bench heard Thursday that Coulson had asked Mr. Collson to have an affair with a married woman. He spoke to Blunkett while he was handling the case of co-defendant Rebekha Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson & Brooks, 3 Oct. 200. He denied colluding with others to hack phones between August 9, 2006 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbek and WeatherUp have admitted phone hacking.
Encouraged by the bang win in the last match, the Indian team will aim to capture the series with a win when they will play in the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
After two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain, India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case to stay in the series and its batsmen performed brilliantly to give them a record win, which made the team equal 2-2 in the series.
In the series, Team India has twice achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice and once again the responsibility of crossing the team's boat will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at the peak at this time and even the biggest target is proving to be dwarfed in front of them.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but the team will also have great expectations from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such an opening pair in the form of Rohit and Shikhar who is making the work of the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he made a great partnership in the opening, giving Virat a chance to play without any pressure.
With the Virat performance Kohli has done so far at number three, he is considered to be the future Sachin Tendulkar.
In fact, many cricket pundits have termed him better than Sachin.
Virat, who will turn 25 next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India has won 16.
His average while chasing the target is above 80.00 and he has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful for the team.
Raina and Yuvraj were flopping badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not been able to open an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODIs can work as a 'lifeline' for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, its batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with their performance.
There are also calls for him to be included in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia has good batsmen up to number nine.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Voges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Huynz and Aaron Finch have not been able to leave any impact in the opening.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling can cost Australia dearly.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly in the series so far, has been sent home for preparations for the Ashes series.
The dream of firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market located in the transport area did not come true.
Firecracker traders are stuck in the middle after the High Court order.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary firecracker market built in Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses to trade in the transport area.
The commission set up by the Punjab and Haryana High Court declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue unsafe during its visit.
A fine of Rs 10 lakh was also imposed on the Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar for lack of proper arrangements there.
In its order, the High Court has strongly reprimanded the administrative officers of Amritsar, saying that what is the use of such an administration which could not solve even a problem of firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not be provided proper space in the city.
After this, by making proper security arrangements, the firecracker traders were asked to issue licenses for business in the market located in Jahazgarh.
Even though the firecracker traders were happy after this order, their happiness was dashed by the police on Friday.
The team of the police's arms license branch reached the cracker market and sold the form by setting up a counter there.
The conditions that were told to him after this, it was impossible to fulfill them in one day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, in-charge of Aslaha License Branch Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the cracker market.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to firecracker traders.
One day is left for Diwali.
Due to this, firecracker traders are upset.
They are seeing a loss of crores of rupees.
Firecracker traders Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni say that if they suffer a loss of crores of rupees, they will stake claim on the district administration.
Angry firecracker traders took out a protest march from Jahazgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They shouted slogans against the police and the district administration.
After this, the temporary firecracker market running in Ranjit Avenue was also closed.

It is true that we cannot do without money.
Money is one of the biggest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to accept it as everything.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Trayodashi of Kartik month.
On Dhanteras, Kubera, the god of wealth, and Yamaraj, the god of death, are worshipped.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No wealth is good or bad.
Our feeling towards money is good and bad.
There can be no more valuable thing than the money which is used for the welfare of humanity, but the money which causes arrogance has no meaning.
We earn money for holy purpose and spend it with holy purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
There should also be a sense of spending some part of it on the society, but the tendency to accumulate money in no way or to accumulate it destroys our conscience, our personality.
The feeling of charity should always remain in the mind.
Even a fraction of the money you give can become the basis of someone's livelihood.
Many people in the society are living in acute deprivation, we all should think about them.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the purushatharas of life.
All people wish for wealth and fame and according to their hard work, they also get wealth and fame.
Only that wealth is durable with respect attached to it.
No matter how rich a criminal becomes, he can neither consume it properly nor can it be of use to anyone else.
If someone else has money, do not be jealous of him.
The true rich are the ones who make way for wealth to flow into innumerable hands.
There can be no better use of wealth than the creation of employment for others.
One more thing, money is not only in the form of money.
It would also have been in the form of your health, character, love for others.
Try to become the owner of this money.
The human population has crossed the 7 billion mark.
If the population continues to grow like this, the time will soon come when it will be difficult to raise a morsel for every hungry mouth.
According to experts, in the near future, humans will have no option but to eat insects.
According to reports, a group of students from McGill University in Montreal won the Hult Prize this year for a unique project.
He has been given this award for preparing protein-rich flour from insects.
As prize money, he has been given a grant of $ 1 million so that he can further his research and experiments.
In an interview with ABC News on September 30, the group's lead student researcher, Mohamed Ashor said his team would now experiment with grasshoppers for food.
This report contains a detailed description of edible insects.
The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed a fraud in the PMT of 2012.
STF has found discrepancies in the roll numbers of 700 students in the investigation.
Of these, about 125 students took admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be canceled.
After the STF revelations, the Medical Education Department has started churning to cancel the admission of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting to get the list of all these suspected students from STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam for cancellation of eligibility of students involved.
However, in this case, the department is also talking about taking legal advice.
Departmental officials say that it has been a year since the students took admission in the year 2012, so it is necessary to seek legal advice in this matter.
With the matter limited to the STF investigation right now, the officials of the Medical Education Department are not in a position to say anything.
Vyapam Director Tarun Pithore says that if the STF submits the list of suspicious students with evidence, their admissions will be canceled immediately.
On the other hand, Director Medical Education Dr. Nirbhay Srivastava said that if the fake admission of the students is found correct, their admission has not been canceled.
According to STF officials, fake students involved in the PMT of 2012 are being investigated.
After investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
It is noteworthy that Vyapam had canceled the eligibility of 345 doubtful students who appeared in the PMT examination held in 2013.
Out of these 345, the medical education department has so far cancelled admissions of 84.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could end the pleasure of smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the pleasure of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine was able to protect the mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further testing is needed before testing on humans can begin, which could take several years, but Ronald Crystal, a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, said the initial signs were positive.
"We very much hope that this type of vaccine strategy may eventually help millions of smokers who have attempted to quit smoking using all the methods on the market today, but finding that their addiction to nicotine is much more powerful than these current methods," said Professor Cornell. "
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, which is designed to transmit genetic information for the purpose of making anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a steady stream of antibodies.
Antibodies detect any nicotine molecules in the blood, and prevent the urge of nicotine inside the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the test, the vaccinated mice that were later given nicotine continued to function normally.
But the mice that were not given the vaccine "felt good," a sign that nicotine had reached its brain, the researchers say.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
It had to be dosed at regular intervals to maintain the level of antibodies, but proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be very high, because the liver will turn the cell into an antibody factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before they are tempted to try cigarettes, so that they can be saved from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They will find that if they start smoking again, they will not get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which could help them quit the habit."
British scientists described the results as interesting, but warned of the need for much more research.

Not even attending school yet and a few months away from taking his first steps, the little boy and his pet Shetland pony Taffy easily completed three stages and won the top prize – surpassing his 30 adult rivals.
At the annual competition organised by the Sunnyback Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff, the inseparable pair – which is the same height as SK – was highly praised for their looks, mannerisms and style.

Shrimat Howells said: "The whole place was full of excitement, and everyone was rejoicing and clapping. "
He was running on the sand all over the amphitheatre, and despite his appearance so small, he did an extraordinary job.
Fenton is passionate about animals – he loves horses, tractors, and ranches, and has raised two hens that he looks after.
The kind of debut he's made will be in the very first horse exhibition of the year – and I'm confident he'll do very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: "Fenton is just three years old, but he knows how to control his pony. "
They are a very good pair.
The judges awarded points based on the manner in which Fenton and Toffee performed and performed in the show ring.
He saw good team work between the pony and its rider – in this case Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm pretty sure Fenton's lovely clothes helped him, he really looked very different.

Tax on foreign property owners will end London's artificial status
The Finance Department has provisionally approved the implementation of CGT. The measures have been calculated, but Mr. The government is awaiting a final decision from Osborne, who introduced a stamp duty of 7 per cent in the 2012 budget for houses priced at more than £2 million, and individuals who prefer to own a home in a company rather than a separate individual.
In the tax year 2012/13, stamp duty from residential properties in Westminster and the towns of Kensington and Chelsea was £708 million, which is already higher than Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook pointed out: "After the increase in stamp duty on high-value homes and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidance Legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is less tax than reasonable on high-value properties, which has no relation to the impact of the outdated council tax system.
He added that "the move, however, could make some foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London and reluctant to sell to existing owners."
Prime Property, the top 5 to 10 per cent share of the housing market by value in affluent south-west London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, saw a record 11.8 per cent rise last year.
According to Savills' research, central London continued to see prices rise steadily at 5.6 per cent each year, but appear to be slightly lower than the growing "domestic market", with the city's southwest, north (7.4 per cent) and east (6.5 per cent) seeing a jump.

Believed in the first freely elected president in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office but his victory day is unlikely to put an end to the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised a "new Egypt" when he took oath of office as the country's first freely elected president to replace ousted Hosni Mubarak 16 months ago.
Upon his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi has become the Arab world's first freely elected Islamist president, and Egypt's fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy nearly 60 years ago.
He took the oath in his chair before the 18 judges in the black cloaks of the court, on the banks of the Nile, which looked like an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are looking for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said during a formal ceremony broadcast live on national television. "
The radical group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years as an outlawed organization since its founding, has been the target of previous governments, is the party's U.S. "Today the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – complete freedom, true democracy and stability," Morsi, 60, said Morsi, an engineer who trained in the U.S. "
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building, and shortly after 11 a.m. local time, Morsi arrived in a small convoy of cars.
Aside from the pomp of the president since Mubarak's era, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courtroom to greet the new president, traffic was also briefly halted so that his motorcade could pass through the normally busy road, which connects the city center to its southern suburbs.
Mocked as the Brotherhood's non-charismatic "empty tire," Morsi's personal reputation rose significantly after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him as the candidate not just of an Islamist but of all those who want to complete the task of the 2011 revolution against dictator Mubarak.
Dressed in a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi sat in a wood-panelled chamber before the judges as he took the oath of office as he said that "today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern nation." "
Morsi then went to the University of Cairo, where he was to deliver his inaugural address.
They were given an official welcome by the military band playing the national tune, while they stood in a posture of caution.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantawi was also present.
Upon his arrival, the hundreds of people present in the lecture hall at the main university there greeted him with the slogan "The army and the people are one hand".
Founded in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic oath in Tahrir Square, the cradle of a revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial rule last year, and vowed to strip the ousted leader last year of presidential powers stripped of his post by the military council.
But by customarily agreeing to take an official oath before the Court instead of competent swearing-in of Parliament, they bowed to the will of the military, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was replete with dramatic popular postures.
You may not believe it, but it is true.
Not only this, Mission Road has been named after Municipal Council President Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has named this to express its displeasure over some of the bad roads in the city.
The event was led by JMM central secretary Sachidanand Pandey.
British police send extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London and requested asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had sent a "surrender notice" to the 40-year-old Australian, requiring him to appear at a police station, adding that failing to do so he would be responsible for being himself arrested.
Assange is facing extradition to Sweden on sex crime charges and his options under British law ended when the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm sent them to the U.S. Fearing that he would be handed over to the Ecuadorian country, he requested asylum at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
A spokesman said Scotland Yard had sent "a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, requiring him to appear at a police station on a date and time chosen by us". "
He is in breach of the conditions of his bail.
The embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the police notice.
Assange fears that more than 250,000 U.S. users on an anti-privacy website called WikiLeaks could be hacked. Due to the issuance of diplomatic cables, he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to face possible espionage charges.
Department officials claim that this is the biggest TDS evasion case ever.
The group operator of the mall deducted TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it to the government treasury.
By doing this, he kept depositing TDS money with himself.
On October 17, the investigation team from Mumbai along with the Jaipur investigation team took action on this group.
In the investigation of this episode, it was found that this businessman has deducted TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team started income tax survey action on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, the group of this mall operator was raided and surveyed.
Angered by this action, this businessman has clearly told the Income Tax Department officials that he is not ready to pay the TDS money to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is constantly targeting them and taking actions.
Officials investigating the case have made it clear that in case of non-payment, recovery action will be taken by freezing the accounts.
Oil continued to decline toward $96 a barrel
The price of oil continued to fall as a report on Friday offset concerns about oversupply as the power-hungry manufacturing sector in China continues to strengthen.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 a barrel by late morning in electronic trading on the U.S. crude New York Mercantile Exchange in Europe.
The contract for the month of October fell down 5.8 percent, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
The adequate supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The Energy Department said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, supply has increased by more than 2.5 million barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand is the uptick in activity that showed two reports on Chinese manufacturing came Friday.
That suggests that growth may continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a two-decade third quarter deceleration of 7.8 percent in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, also a benchmark for international crude used by U.S. refineries, fell 26 cents from $108.58 a barrel on the ICE exchange in London.
Pawan Bansal, surrounded by opposition questions at the rail gate, surprised the opposition by saying at one place that he had not looked at anyone's woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised that where did the woman's talk come from.
Perhaps Bansal was referring to the domestic relations of a big BJP leader and a corporator.
Turning the matter the other way, Bansal told reporters that the BJP had conspired to get a complaint by putting a woman behind him during the last parliamentary elections, which could not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said that he has been questioned by the CBI in the rail bribery case.
If he was made a witness in the case, would he have been made only after a thorough investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam he is talking about, he had written a letter only for a needy person.
If this is their crime, they will commit such a sin forever.
He said that although he did not have the constitutional right to raise this issue in the Corporation House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as the development work is concerned, the opposition will be given a list of development works for 15 years.
The way Chandigarh is being developed or going to happen, these people cannot even think of that.

However, people who left for home from the office had to spend hours in jam to reach home.
The allegations against Jonathan Lord were preceded by the Y.M.C.A. Royal Commission hears two employees charged with sexual offences
Before charges were brought against Carringbah child care worker Jonathan Lord in 2011, the YMCA was investigating the case. Two NSW employees have been charged with child sexual offences.
But in its statement before the commission, it said it had "never brought to light a case of child sexual abuse within its organisation", it was told to the commission.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which the YMCA was involved. An employee of the U.S. was charged with child pornography offenses, and another case in which the YMCA was charged with child pornography offenses. The Carringbah gym instructor was charged with child sex crimes against children in his care in 1991.
Advocate Gail Furness, who assisted the Commission, told Mr. Hare said he knew about the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the YMCA was not allowed before the Commission. The statement that "YMCA An external investigation has been conducted and they have filed an FIR against the YMCA. The "child safety" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA It was notified and received the second lowest rating out of four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare who is YMCA The U.S., who has been associated with the U.S., aged 21, admitted that management "including myself" had failed to appoint Lord, and failed to ensure that employees were clearly aware of their obligations to report child protection policy violations.
Earlier this year, Lord Co, the Y.M.C.A. He was convicted of sexual offences with 12 children during his two-year tenure in the U.S.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that the YMCA should be a part of the country. There was a cultural problem in the U.S., which caused staff not to report a child safety breach by Lord.
The staff gave evidence of what they saw about the violation, including Lord spending time alone with the children, babysitting them privately, making them sit on their laps, telling them he loved them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Oakwell, who was under Lord Oakwell's supervision, and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behaviour, testified that the YMCA who supervised Lord was not a child of the child. Carringbah child services manager Jacquie Barnat was "very threatening and difficult to meet most of the time".
The CEO said that he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable giving above information to their manager.
She said that, rather, her friendship with Lord misled her decision to give information about him.
Mr. Hare said he had joined the YMCA. The NSW had provided the board with its view that the text for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord incident" was "about non-disclosure".
Mr. Hare said that the decision to get the employees to sign the confidentiality agreement was taken immediately after the allegations surfaced. The child service was conducted by General Manager Liam Whiteley.
He said the aim was to avoid mixing of evidence, but it was "overzealous" and not properly executed.
Griffith University's Child Sexual Exploitation Special Professor Stephen Smalbone said that between 2099 and 2011, Jonathan Lord was at work during the YMCA scandal. The NSW was not a safe organization.
He said there were "serious problems" in the appointment, monitoring, admission, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Pawnbrokers' silver due to hardship felt by middle class in Singapore
Janani Amirthalinga at Pawnshop at Bendemeier Shopping Centre in Singapore is accepting cash by giving her gold bangles, rings and earrings to pay her daughter's school fees.
"My husband and I recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it. "
She says that although she earns SGD3,000 (US$2,400) as an administrator, and her husband is employed too, the monthly family income is insufficient.
In fact, there is similar demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is on the rise – Valuemax became the third pawnshop to list on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledging jewellery is not the only way to get cash – 1,300 Singapore dollars in Ms. Amirthalinga's case – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Pawnbrokers in Singapore typically charge 17 per cent per annum, slightly higher than the 15.4 per cent offered by United Overseas Bank, a local lender that has a branch in the same shopping centre.
However, pawnbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit checks or proof of pay, and can provide loans much faster than banks.
Millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as households face hardship due to rising cost of living and increase in household and consumer debt.
With five years of strong growth after the global financial disaster, and cheap credit slowdown due to easy monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income households turning to pawnshops to meet their needs.
This week, rating agency Standards Ange Poor's cited rising domestic gains due to rising mortgages as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
It said Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt to GDP ratios in Asia.
Malaysia GDP It tops the list with 80 per cent of the population, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer debt in Thailand, which has emerged mildly from the tech meltdown this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing export slowdown and a slowdown in consumer demand.
Malaysian Bank, CIMB "The crucial point is that with rising prices, people in the middle to lower classes [of the income scale] will try to increase their incomes in every possible way," said Song Seung Wun, an economist in the Spring Press. "
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to mortgage personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the value of their family jewellery.
In Singapore, 70 percent of the items pledged in 200 pawn outlets in the City-State are gold.
People are saying "The price of gold looks good, let's pawn grandma's gold chain, and will take it back next month."
Thailand's largest ponshop operator, Egeemoney, has seen a 20 per cent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
The pawn-holding business is growing so much that Valuemax, operator of outlets in Bendimeer and 15 others like it in Singapore, plan to expand not only in their neighbourhood, Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yahh Li Ching, executive director of Valuemax.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the SGD 66 million it may receive in listing this week on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders have been criticized for high interest rates, Ms. Yah says that not only does mortgage lenders get cheaper rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase lending.
"Customers pledge items they already own, and redeeming personal assets does not add to household debt," she says.
There is increasing social acceptability of pawnbroking for obtaining short-term and safe financial support.
It is not that pawnbrokers are used only by financially weak individuals.
In Singapore, wealthy individuals also use ValueMax outlets, pledging gold bars or Rolex watches that can get a cash payment of up to 60 per cent of their purchase price.
We have customers from all sections of society.
"These include wealthy individuals who need short-term loans for business ventures or investments, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow needs," says Ms. Yah. "
Sometimes, they just need money in a very short time.
On Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of utensils to gold and silver in the capital.
There has been an increase of 20 to 30 per cent in such purchases compared to last year.
In Shimla, jewellery shops were thronged by people.
Utensils shops decorating from Lower Bazaar to Mall Road also saw a huge crowd.
Although inflation was eclipsed on such items this year, people still did not show stinginess in shopping at the auspicious time.
On Friday, the auspicious time for shopping was from 7:52 am to 10:12 am, 1:56 to 3:37 pm and 6:17 pm to 8:12 pm.
During the above three muhurats, more crowds of people thronged the suburbs including Shimla for more shopping.
In Shimla Lower Bazar, people did not find a place to set foot on.
The crowd in every small and big shop was also engaged in the same way.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, celebrated as Dhantrayodashi of Krishna Paksha of Kartik month, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
According to the information, on Thursday, an urban willow named Habibullah Malla in Haritara-Sopore was going towards the nursery.
Suddenly he was attacked by a bear.
He resisted the bear and shouted for help.
By the time people from nearby reached the spot to help him, the bear had badly scratched his face.
People raised an alarm by throwing stones at the bear.
On this, he left Habibullah and hid in the nursery.
Villagers rushed the injured Habibullah to the hospital for treatment.
$325 million rescue package for Taizy's health
The federal government has insisted that a $325 million rescue package for Tasmania's ailing health system is accompanied by stringent conditions that will ensure the state government cannot waste funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking "urgent action" to address the current crisis caused by the island state's ageing population, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The funding over a period of four years was decided following Government's consultation with Independent MP Andrew Wilkie of Tasmania.
"The government has brought out an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the specific challenges faced by the state," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package also includes a $31 million elective surgery plan.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgeries, will help resolve previous collected cases.
It also includes funding for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lawnsstation, improved post-hospital care, training of medical specialists, mental health services and introduction of personal electronic health records systems in local hospitals.
Ms Plibersek said: "These investments are in line with the best practices reported to me by leading practitioners to improve Tasmania's health system. "
The minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regimes.
The State must maintain current funding levels to receive Commonwealth funding, and report each month where the excess funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be set up to ensure that the service is delivered by the state in the most effective and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said $325 million would mean not much "unless real reforms are made to get Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level." "
He, however, appreciated the Government for responding to their request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister's notice in early May. "
Mr. Wilkie said, "I hope that the federal aid package will be very helpful toward separating the state public health system from the crisis-prone list." "
According to the state government, these additional alternative procedures will mainly undo the recent cuts.
But federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a Band-Aid solution." "
He served as an A.B.C. "We're here because the State of Labor government has taken $430 million into its health system," he told TV.
You cannot take away nearly half a billion dollars by the State Government and 300 million dollars by the Commonwealth as a day of good news.
Mr. Dutton demanded that Ms. Plibersek should guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
NSA disclosures about state surveillance fuel corporate fears.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter rattled over the U.S. consulate in Germany's financial capital Frankfurt.
At the direction of the Office for Defender of the Constitution (BfV), Germany's domestic intelligence agency's mission was to photograph the roof of the U.S. outpost, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media asked the BfV to express hope to identify the presence of listening antennas and indicated an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Klepper, director of U.S. national intelligence, emphasized that the U.S. delevered its foreign intelligence capabilities to "steal foreign companies' trade secrets and de-regulate American companies to enhance their international competitiveness or broaden their bottom line." Don't use it in September.
But ever since Edward Snowden, a whistleblower turned whistleblower, began leaking his treasure trove of secrets to U.S. surveillance, European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether the director will keep his word.
The U.S. National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and that our cloud providers, including Google and Yahoo, and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it was revealed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful individuals can be targeted, surely business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made intensive cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be feasible that these data be used for mutual benefit.
"Germany must wake up" says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
German companies believe according to a survey published in July by the consultancy, the U.S. almost now has a bigger risk than China, when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft.
In all the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, there is, however, no evidence to date that the U.S. has known the trade secrets of foreign companies to its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the EU's lack of internet capabilities. And it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
Business leaders are skeptical about this.
Somebody said in the German Parliament that we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again...
"It's not the way," said Hasso Plattner, president of German business software company SAP.
If one wanted a strong European IT industry, then it was not supposed to die 20 years ago.
Everything is discounted in Germany. From coal, to cars, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations uncovered by Snowden about US technological sophistication and espionage reach have come as a shock to some companies that previously believed the biggest surveillance threat was China
A major shift is taking place in the cloud computing sector where European authorities are more aware that data stored in the US is subject to that jurisdiction and therefore has become potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey put out by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade body, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after revelations about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-chief executive officer of SAP says: "We saw a new question that customers didn't come across a year ago – that is—where is my data stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically stay in that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are simply confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore must be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage occurs is not a surprise.
It has always been there.
"This has been a topic for many years, and fundamentally through current discussion, nothing changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level and we do too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses
Corporate leaders are generally not keen about defense, and this is an advantage to the attacker.
For large companies, it's unwise to leave a message in business from home with a USB stick, or leave a laptop unapologetically in a hotel room, to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, board member of the car manufacturer Audi, says it is a years-old system of collecting mobile phones before board meetings because they cannot be used as remote listening devices
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised because of risks on trips abroad.
The prepaid mobile phones were then thrown away later.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a concern.
In Germany, it is the first in the global market of many companies in a special place.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned about economic espionage by other countries on their own companies.
France named the Washington Post in February a second tier of criminals who engage in hacking economic intelligence, which followed China with Russia and Israel, according to The Washington Post.
According to a board member of a German blue chip company, when it comes to economic espionage, "the French are the worst
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in the interview that: "The services know very well that all countries, even if they support non-terrorist fighting, spies on their allies."
Americans spy on us on a commercial and industrial level and we do too, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses
No one was fooled.
A large number of participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts attended the training.
Over a period of seven days, all the participants were given information about tent pitching, flag pole and many other skills.
The training is being carried out with the support of Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
All the participants are spreading the spirit of unity by participating in the interfaith prayer.
Camp head Vipin Kumar, State Training Commissioner is giving his special support.
State media member Ajay Rai said that he will go on a campaign campaign there from November 4.
Bhagat will concentrate himself in the assembly constituencies of Chhattisgarh adjoining Jharkhand.
They are also well aware of these areas.
They will continue to stay in Chhattisgarh till November 16.
There is a lot of demand from Jharkhand leaders in the election season of Chhattisgarh.
More than two dozen BJP leaders are already there.
The Congress had also requested JMM supremo Shibu Soren and Chief Minister Hemant Soren to campaign for the party in Chhattisgarh, which was accepted by the JMM's top leadership.
The JMM has also withdrawn 10 of its candidates announced earlier.
JMM has instructed the Chhattisgarh state committee that all the leaders should get involved in the election campaign in favor of the Congress.
Obama's voters scream of disappointment
I voted twice for Obama in anticipation of change
He says that the GOP Obama's great efforts have been hampered by the policy of obstruction in the US
Obamacare website troubles can't excuse drone attacks
Obama's memoir of the 2008 campaign is a reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books these days.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during my sophomore years of medical school and give me hope.
It is called "Dare to Win," and it commemorates Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I find myself free from my patients' prescriptions at night and go to bed, this book takes me through a time when politics inspired millions and speeches could take your breath away.
The elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a pause to reflect on the historical significance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents treasured every newspaper they met.
A band of young visionaries were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
He had an approval rating of 82 percent when Obama was president in 2008.
And then I closed the book.
The reality of the present is a harsh reality, like returning from the dream world.
It's hard to recall those days of hope – they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of lost opportunities.
There was a real change after I voted for the first time.
To put it simply, I couldn't have imagined any of it.
I credit Obama for many accomplishments, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our forces from Iraq, to the end of "Don't Ask No Tell" to the killing of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that a policy of partisan protest has hindered many of our country's efforts to move forward: including immigration reform, public alternatives to healthcare, closing the base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But the innumerable times in which I have taken the side of the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues have run out of answers that I can give them.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Republicans' protest policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is it a response to drone strikes on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the National Security Agency's collection of data about the private lives of ordinary American citizens, nor can it respond to prosecuting people who expose government misconduct.
It cannot explain the murder of American citizen Anwar El Awlaki without trial, nor the shrinking public funding and spending limits during the presidential campaign.
It could not answer the findings of the report, which says the White House's efforts to silence the media "have been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration so far." "
And most recently, it can't excuse the failure to design a simple website even after three years of the Affordable Care Act being signed into law.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at the age of 18, I should have anticipated that the system of governance might contradict the political campaign that brought this forward.
Apparently, elected office is not a predictable path, as opposing political parties and random events such as the Newtown massacre will shape our public discourse.
Yet the examples I have cited above seem to be mostly chosen by the administration itself.
This is what bothers you the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled with his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain alternative that did not seem to dictate his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hopes we have long heard about.
Yet, while Obama's approval rating is down 45 percent this week, it has become much harder to return to the year 2008 through that book.
Seeing him reminds me of his vanished promises.
I was reading a portion of the book this week describing how Clinton was not at a huge disadvantage because of Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
At a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinates that he needed to get back on track, and stay true to his objectives.
He said "I want to get my mojo back".
We must remember who we are. ’
Today, five years later, Mr. President, I can't agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this note are those of Nathaniel Morris.
The monitoring group said Syria had destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons
The monitor on Thursday said Syria destroyed equipment critical to producing chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, while a raging conflict erupted in the north of Syria, which is very close to where the toxic agents are believed to be located.
Also on Thursday, the Syrian Movement group said some 120,000 people have been killed since Syria's civil war began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before the November 1 deadline
The Hague-based organization had designated Damascus to destroy or "ineffective" all chemical weapons production units and machinery used to mix chemicals in toxic gases and fill them with munitions.
The completion of the initial phase of the main destruction, in particular, is a significant milestone in this ambitious development, which aims to eliminate all of Damascus' chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to destroy the existing weapons and collections.
Syria is now believed to have 1,000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports that the announcement came as clashes escalated on Thursday in the town of Safhira, which experts believe is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as a collection centre.
The movement group, which records the death toll through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 6,365 are civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
The government says 29,954 are members of President Bashar Assad's forces, 18,678 are fighters for the government and 187 are Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
It also said among the dead were 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. It estimates that about 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict since March 2011.
It has not updated the figures since then.
The conflict has forced nearly two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces battled rebels in Saphirah for weeks, many of whom belonged to al-Qaida groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said there were casualties on both sides, but did not say anything specific.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors who have the mission of eliminating toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war, in a very short time-frame.
OPCWs working closely with the United Nations The statement said its team was "satisfied and has confirmed – and seen – all of Syria's declared critical production and mixing/filling equipment - destroyed." "
It also said, "No further inspection activity is being planned." "
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first phase of confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 facilities announced by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit the two centres due to security reasons.
OPCW on Friday He said that according to Syria these two centers "have been abandoned and... The chemical weapons products stored there were transported to other declared facilities, which have been inspected. "
It was not immediately clear whether the unit at Saphira was one of the two centres where the OPCW was located. The inspectors were not able to go.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which will be delivered to the OPCW next month. To be approved by the Executive Committee of the Trustees.
In remarks issued by the OPCW, Ahmet Uzumku, director general of the monitoring group, said: "I salute the tenacity and courage displayed by you in accomplishing the most challenging mission this organization has undertaken so far. "
The three-year civil war is primarily a conflict between Assad's government and its security forces, including members of the Alawite sect of Shiite Islam, and rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another development, the head of the observatory, Rami Abdurrahman, said a powerful explosion took place on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
He said the cause of the explosion was not yet known.
In the case of Nortel patents, financial suits have been filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei.
A group owned by thousands of former Nortel patents filed multiple patent lawsuits on Thursday against cell phone makers, including Google, which it beat in the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
A consortium called Rockstar that bought Noretel patents for $4.5 billion has signed a U.S. contract in Texas. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. has been charged with patent infringement in District Court. Ltd., H.T.C. The corporation, Huawei and four other companies have been sued.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents also include technology that matches words searched on the Internet with words from relevant advertising that is a core part of Google's search business, the indictment said.
Samsung, Huawei, HTC And representatives of Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC All of them make phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which is fiercely competing with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of $900 million for Nortel patents.
Google increased the bid several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, mainly due to Motorola having a long list of patents.
The indictment states that "Google has violated, and continues to infringe, despite losing an attempt to acquire patents-in-suite at auction"
Rockstar has sought enhanced damages against Google as it claims Google's infringement of patents is absurd.
FAA: Plane passengers can now use gadgets on aircraft (but can't make calls from cell phones)
Airplanes will be able to use their electronic devices — but not talk to their cellphones — from entering the gate to disembarking — to reading, working, playing games, watching movies, listening to music — under much-anticipated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
The FAA at a news conference. Michael Huarta, Administrator of Enterprise Pvt. Ltd. said how fast these changes are implemented will vary from airline to airline.
Airlines to FAA They will have to show how their aircraft meet the new guidelines, and how they are updating the rules for collecting their crew training manuals and devices to reflect the guidelines.
The FAA has said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
"Depending on the state of the plan, we may approve the extended use of the electronic device very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the plane door is closed.
They are not required to start the aircraft until it reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and is permitted by the Captain.
Passengers are expected to switch off their devices again when the plane lands, and not to turn it on until the plane has fully landed.
"Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are fully protected from electronic interference may permit their passengers to use the device while taking off, landing and taxiing," the FAA said.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft which are modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are required to meet these norms.
Laura Gladding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, has welcomed these changes.
"When the policy is safely implemented – and we work with airlines to do that – it will be a win-win for both sides," Gladding said in a statement. "
We're bored of feeling like "hall monitors" when it comes to this issue.
But surfing, exchanging emails, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data by connecting to the internet at altitudes below 10,000 feet will still be restricted, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversation with friends, a game like Scrabble, the famous incident associated with it is that in 2011, actor Alec Baldwin was kicked off a plane by American Airlines after he was playing on his smartphone while in the plane park at the gate, and refused to turn off the device.
And heavy equipment such as laptops etc. will still have to be stored because they will worry about hurting the other person in the cabin if they bounce.
Cellphone calls will also continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory authority related to phone calls rests with the Federal Communications Commission, FAA. Not near.
FAA during takeoff and landing of aircraft May remove restrictions on some electronic devices.
Last month, Mark Rosenken of the National Transportation Safety Board, who was sent to CBS, was sent to the United States. The National Transportation Safety expert at the News said cell phones are still considered a risk.
"Cell phones are really a serious issue, not just because they can potentially interfere with navigation-related devices, but also because they can interfere with cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rosencker said.
The FAA was sent to investigate this issue. The Industry Advisory Committee set up by the CISF recommended last month that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
To reduce restrictions from their use, the FAA But the pressure has been mounting in recent years.
Seine. Critics such as Claire McCaskilk, D-Mo, have stated that there is no valid safeguard reason for prohibition.
These restrictions are becoming increasingly difficult to enforce because device use is ubiquitous.
Some studies also indicate that nearly a third of travelers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when FM devices were used by passengers. There were reports of disruption in navigation and communication equipment due to carrying of radio and high technology gadgets of the time.
New airlines rely more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also required to comply with FAA. It has been designed and approved to be resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi access at cruising altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huerta said most airlines should meet eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices emit much lower power radio transmissions than previous generation electronic devices.
E-readers, for example, have very nominal transmission during page turning.
But transmissions are strong when the device downloads or sends data.
There has also been Amazon.com of those who favored reducing restrictions on the use of the device by travelers.
In 2011, company executives loaded their entire Kindle e-readers into the airline and flew them to test for problems, but no such problems were found.
The FAA is concerned about the risks associated with the use of the device. The Advisory Committee has expressed mixed sentiments.
Douglas Kidd, of the National Air Passengers Association, said he believes the disruption caused by the device is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said that there are only reports described by the pilot in support of the device interference in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
However, the members of the Committee recommended that the FAA should be revived. Allow the pilot to order passengers to switch off the device when the aircraft lands in low visibility.
The travel industry group has welcomed the changes and described them as a common sense facility for people travelling in the latest age of technology.
CEO of the U.S. Travel Association "We are delighted that the FAA has been able to do so," said Roger Doe. has recognized that the traveler who travels with joy is not incompatible with safety and security.

Pakistan is seriously engaged in fulfilling this promise.
Killing of soldiers on the border, suicide attacks in Samba, Hiranagar are part of this strategy.
Terming the demand for abolition of army privileges in the state as "fatal" in such a situation, the BJP leader said that even talking like such things till there is permanent peace in the state is anti-people.
They encourage anti-national elements.
He stressed that statements by leaders that demoralise the army and security forces should be stopped.

A recent media report said that the NSA stole information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for espionage.
The Washington Post has revealed this based on documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowden.
According to the report, the NSA's program was called Muscular, which it ran in collaboration with its British counter part – GCHQ.
The two agencies stole data passing through the vast fiber-optic cable networks laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post, citing a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, said that more than 180 million documents were collected within three days of the event launching.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run out of the US and an anonymous telecommunications provider helped the NSA access this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run this program outside the US, because in the US such operations must have court orders.
"To the best of my knowledge, this has never happened," NSA chief General Keith Alexander said during a news conference in Washington.
The NSA has always collected all information within the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German chancellor.
The United Nations said on Wednesday that the US administration has assured that its communications will not be monitored.
The US has also said that UN communications are not monitored.
GM to correct the seatbacks U.S. Pickup trucks recalled in

The recall models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM's trucks began being shipped in June and, after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal, the top U.S. This marks the most important Vahan launch for the automaker.
The GM had informed the truck owners about the defect in late October.

Schools were obliged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
In the courses in English literature, students must read at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story from 1914 onwards.
The exam will also include "unseen text" to encourage greater reading.
A combined English literature and language course will be abolished.
From the year 2015, students will be given a separate GCSE in the language. There will be a lot of motivation to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will launch the new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow — the two being the first subjects to be revolutionised.
It will also change other key themes next year.
In a different step, the examination regulator is going to replace GCSE with a new grading system, and reduced syllabus. Display the changes in the structure of the structure.
Speaking over the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a great deal of consensus that, in order to restore public confidence, we need to reform our examination system." It will be "more challenging, more ambitious and tougher".
Studies found that English schools devote less time to math – 116 hours a year or more – 3 hours less a week during sessions than in most countries.
Australian schools provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there will be no formal need to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources said that comprehensive mathematics will be based on GCSE. - Combining for more weight with subjects in the league table was likely to encourage schools to provide extra learning.
The course will focus more on "real-world problems", including financial mathematics.
Disputes over seat width put jet manufacturers' large orders at stake.
Setting the momentum for this month's Dubai Airshow, there has been a spree among aircraft manufacturers leading to the breadth of tourist-class seats for long-haul flights
The dispute centered on economy class seat width on long-haul planes, not always like those offered by airlines, but whose allotted space efficiency has been claimed to be key by the latest jet Airbus SAS and Boeing Company.
Airbus expects to offer at least 18 inches (46 cm) wide seating in economy cabins this week, but this should be dictated by the airline, its main rival Boeing said.
The dispute comes after the 17/21 incident sparked a race to sell the larger version of the twin-engine long-range aircraft out of a possible recorded order.
How is the rear division of the aircraft built – specifically whether seating equals 9 or 10?
Boeing says it built the "777X" that would house 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row.
Competing with the A350, Airbus says it will carry 350 people in an 18-inch 9-a-level seat.
The aircraft giant often strikes on technical matters through advertising in the trade press.
Now, with the Airbus 777X expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Airshow, it is further appealing to the public.
Lately it has been seen that whatever the beginning of the Viginess War, the three of them together in a restaurant while showing this to Financero will you accept this?
Airbus sales chief John Leahy said "Boeing is offering long-haul flights in narrow seats, even narrower than the regional turbo."
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way the plane sits has not changed.
According to U.S. Department of Health data, between the 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-term travel, and by the end of the century, the average 40-49-year-old male weight increased by 10 percent.
According to U.S. Health Statistics, the average American man's waist in the 21st century is 39.7 inches.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a seat concept from the 1950s when the average circumference of the new name, "jet sets", was narrower.
Airbus says it has set up a research commission to suggest an extra inch in seat width by 53 percent to improve sleep quality.
Boeing disputed Airbus' seat measurement data, saying it is not up to manufacturers deciding how airlines balance fares and convenience.
It also says, research shows that more than the width of a seat depends on the cabin experience.
Boeing cabin expert Kent Craver said. It really helps airlines have flexibility and what they believe they need to do to be successful. "
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit from."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's all about elbow room, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
Behind this dispute is at least a $700 billion trade estimate that the competition of aircraft orders is enough in the coming decades to tip the scales of U.S. and European exports.
The Reuters report reported for the first time in July, whether seat layout is really a battle issue between the new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed 20 percent efficiency per seat in their new twin-engine design compared to that segment's leader's 365-seat Boeing 777-300AR.
Boeing's performance claim relies on comparison with the original 777 777 X-One 9-Wala 777 design.
The 10 equals now used comparison with the benefit in unit cost.
Kevin Kenniston, head of Airbus passenger facility for Europe, says "Boeing is doing it to make their aircraft more competitive with our products, to occupy more seats".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the current 777 S suggests that many passengers favor the denser layout, which can go with cheaper fares as well.
Cabin interiors expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network, said, "The eighteen-inch seat width will remain great for passengers, but the reality is that this trading point of Airbus is driven by the threat of Proposition 777"
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are suppliers for airlines to choose from.
Jet vendors around the world should also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
For more comfort, all builders are also offering low-cost carriers of jets and high-density layouts for regional travel.
Airbus is giving a 10 par to the A350 but says it is not sold yet.
But until recently, Airbus insisted on wider cabin seats on some of its jets in need of more cabin comfort.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly at a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers, but it could distract from the wave of 777X sales.

Premature puberty: early growing up
Research shows that African-American and Hispanic girls attain puberty at a younger age than white girls their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be to blame
Experts believe that obesity outbreaks may be a cause of puberty at an early age
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should a mother be worried if her daughter starts developing breasts and growing genital hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes are common in American girls, reflecting a new trend.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents that it usually doesn't represent a rapid progress toward full puberty," says Kalowitz. "
Direct signs of growth such as breast sprouting, genital and armpit hair, and body odour are seen prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, there has been a very slight change in the age of menstruation (first menstruation).
In the United States, the median age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"First menopause takes at least two to three years when breasts begin to develop," explains Kaplowitz, who teaches "Premature puberty in girls: The essential guide to dealing with this common problem." He is also the author of
The most accurate test of the development of puberty is time.
There is debate about what constitutes the onset of puberty, but when growth accompanies breast development before the age of 8 the two call it "child-adult."
In most cases, this process will slow down or stop – something that the pediatrician can closely monitor.
In case of more rapid progression, investigations by an endocrinologist may be required to rule out the possibility of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments to delay premature menstruation and other outcomes are: premature aging of the bones, which can lead to stunted growth and stunting as adults.
Recommendations for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
The psychological aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs but admits, "Suppressing puberty can trigger behavioural issues, and girls may start to feel isolated from their peers. "
The second big problem is understandable: parents simply do not want their underage daughter to menstruate.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," Kalowitz said. "
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating when she was 10. ’
Although there were symptoms and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally ready.
She returned from her school, scared and upset that she was the first to menstruate among her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexually suggestive messages in the media can be blamed.
Boys too – just like girls – are attaining premature puberty.
The Kaplowitz rule that the main cause of this is the outbreak of obesity.
In 2001, she helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9 that links body fat with the time of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that also contribute.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to attain puberty earlier than white girls their age.
There are many explanations.
Globally, patterns of premature puberty appear to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to weather and genes.
Other puzzle: Although boys are gaining facial and genital hair at an early age, the trend of full puberty is not as pronounced in them as in girls.
Other physicians who attended the AAP conference supported the complexities of the topic.
Even in infants and children, acne and genital hair have become common.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty," says Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey. "
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician for opinions on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean negotiating ahead of the expected time," Caplowitz advised. "
Your child will usually respond properly if you remain calm.
Girls who develop prematurely need to be assured that even if it is happening prematurely, it is part of normal life.

Tripody denies being influenced by Obide.
Former NSW Labour Minister Joe Tripody will be investigated by the State Corruption Watchdog.
Former NSW Labour minister Joe Tripody has refused to refute the sea-lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obide, the former New South Wales patriarch, who had a hidden interest in three government-controlled lands.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) detailed the investigation on Friday, whether Mr Obide lobbied several state ministers for violating circulars of the leases policy? Where two restaurants and cafes, owned by Obide, were renewed without tender after their expiry in August 2005.

Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy asked Mr. Tripodi. "Was the development of the commercial lease policy the matter being discussed in the telephone conversation?"
"No," Mr. Tripody replied.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it certainly wasn't.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obide.

If granted parole, he can be released in 15 years.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in Kuta's famed tourist area that killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and wounded scores more.
He was also convicted on several other terrorism-related charges, including a Christmas Eve 2000 church bombing in Indonesia.
Prosecutors had asked for a life sentence, although they could have demanded the death penalty for what he called the "destroyer," notorious as the master man who made the bomb.
The decision revived painful memories of Perth-based woman June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and his co-conspirators a decade ago.
Holding back his tears, he said Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been given the same punishment as other dreaded terrorists.
Ms. Courtein told AAP "He should be made to stand in front of the firing party. "
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
On 12th October, 2002, shortly after 11 p.m., the Club was wiped out after a bomb loaded in a van parked outside The Sari Club exploded.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddies bar when suicide bombers detonated a backpack full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He went into a month-long coma as a result of this bombing incident and "died" three times while on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says Patek should have received the same punishment as the three other members of the Jemmah Islamiyah terrorist group responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Mukhalas and Imam Samudra, who had been executed four years earlier.
In fact, this person should be executed before anyone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive, see, to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring innumerable people, 20 years' imprisonment is not enough.
Patek is the last person to be convicted of the Bali bomb blasts.
He evaded capture for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested, in January 2011, in Abattabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. The military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, the F.B.I. The agent presented evidence that the report revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda.
"He didn't surrender," says Ms. Courtene. "
Even today, he does not really regret the mental suffering caused to so many people.
The decision comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears shed this year," Ms. Courtein said. "
Patek can still appeal his sentence.
When the hotel staff protested, they started fighting.
The son of the drunk MP started a scuffle with the hotel owner's younger brother RK Singh, who came to the rescue.
Meanwhile, many more people came there.
When he tried to catch the young man who was assaulting, he fired from the revolver.
The firing created a sensation in the area.
On this, the hotel staff caught him and called the police after informing him.
Hotel owner Munna Singh lodged an FIR against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, resident of Berwa Paharpur under Koirana police station of Bhadohi district.
On which the police arrested him and seized the revolver.
According to Handia Inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, runs a hotel named Raag Darbar on the National Highway.
At around eight o'clock in the night, Anand Pandey reached the hotel and ordered food.
When there was a delay in preparing food, he started abusing, assaulting and firing.
Anand was under the influence of alcohol and also threatened to kill the hotel staff.
The hotel is near Bhiti village and is adjacent to Bhadohi district, the inspector said.
Cocaine-addicted lawyer jailed for giving secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
Basharat Ditta, 42, used to pass on information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The advocate felt that people might find out about his secret drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by Liverpool Crown Court
The top defense attorney, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation because he feared the public would find out about his secret drug addiction, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Barasat Ditta, 42, after being compromised by his cocaine addiction, provided notorious criminal Neil Scarborough with sensitive confidential information about his drug trafficking activities being investigated.
The advocate, nicknamed "Bash" and praised as a "top brief" by criminals, was arrested from his home in 2011 after conducting police surveillance in Scarborough, which he represented in a previous narcotics trial.
Officers observed Scarborough, 32, placing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was out for a Law Society dinner with colleagues.
After finding cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, his wallet, and his credit card, the investigation revealed that Ditta was a "regular user" of a category A drug.
During an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain information on behalf of Scarborough and his accomplice about the arrest of two people.
All four suspects were under police surveillance at the time as part of a main investigation into the heroin and cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
Among them were 32 other individuals who were jailed after police seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine, and more than £200,000 in cash during multiple raids.
Ditta used to provide information to criminals because he feared that his cocaine addiction would be revealed to the public.
Ditta, who works at law firm Forbes Solicitors based in Blackboned, was facing indignation at Liverpool Crown Court today after being found guilty of two counts of obstruction of the course of justice after a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
He had pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine at an earlier hearing.
The lawyer's ordeal began when, while investigating Scarborough, police discovered that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta since February 2011.
Two detectives chased the suspect and saw him coming into Ditta's home and placing a drug with more than 60 percent purity under the lawyer's bin in a black golf glove.
Scarborough was in regular phone contact with Ditta after the drug possession, who was out for dinner at Blackburn Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer found that drugs were stored there and they had spoken nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was found to be a "regular user of cocaine" after tests found traces of a Class A drug on his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he was talking to the suspected dealer because he was his client and that their discussions were a matter of "legal privilege".
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove several credit cards by taking out his wallet, but these were confiscated, and his hair was sampled.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his work place as well as from his home, and his clients used to call his house for legal matters.
After the key men arrested told them what the detectives knew about them, the court hearing said Ditta used to call key figures in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously supplied.
Annie White, on behalf of the prosecution, said that: "The criminal advocate should be best informed about not breaking the law." "
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal advocate, too much involvement with his specific client.
We are not talking about the relationship of the ordinary drug dealer, but the dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have been legal beyond a doubt, because he was a lawyer.
But he went far beyond his limits of the lawyer-client relationship.
He disrupted the police investigation as much as possible so that they would remain able to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was insulting his profession, not honoring.
He developed a great deal of closeness with certain clients, notably Scarborough, and allowed his independence to compromise.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough I would not have waited for 15 hours, but I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of Lancashire Police said: "Mr Ditta transformed himself from a criminal advocate to a criminal at the time he began receiving drugs from organised criminals. "
His cocaine addiction made him highly compromised and too vulnerable to the aims of leading members of organized crime groups, who used him to obtain important information relating to police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standard of probity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to escape under the garb of his profession.
Mr Ditta was investigated by Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit, which found him guilty of three counts of cocaine possession and now obstruction of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to criminals that no person is far from the reach of law.
We will find you and bring you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other gang members were imprisoned for drug offenses for a total of 153 years.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said her fantasy job would be to be a lawyer for clients facing death penalty in the United States, Muhammad Ali being her dinner guest, and Inequality being the inspiration for her work.
Bombardier profits fall as aircraft deliveries, orders fall
Canadian airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, in the third quarter at its train unit and less than that on contract issues as pressure by aircraft orders and deliveries eased.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or present an update on issues the aircraft would complete its ambitious schedule of going into commercial service from next September.
After the first flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, it has flown just three times, raising the question whether the test phase is on track or not.
The results fell short of forecasts and sent the stock to sliding more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst with National Bank Financial, had downgraded its rating to "sector performance" from "out" on Thursday to "outperform" the stock has been up during the next one or two quarters.
"While weak aircraft deliveries were mostly as anticipated, we are clearly disappointed with the margin performance in transport," Dorsen said in a client note.
We will receive new orders for Bombardier CSeries as flight test schedules progress.
However, if any new orders are not announced in the coming months, it is doubtful that the market will be apprehensive of the program.
Bombardier hopes the aircraft family can now cut it off at the low end of a market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
Potential buyers wait for flight test results to validate the company's claims about new jetliner fuel efficiency and potential cost savings, but as confirmed orders for CSeries are moderate to 177.
403 complete orders and commitments are available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin was confident Bombardier would meet its 300-firm order goal by the time the first jet was put into commercial use.
Officials reassured analysts and the media on Thursday that the event was going on as scheduled.
"The test plane stayed on the ground longer than anticipated," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane's intermission.
Every manufacturer creates a schedule in a different way.
We had decided to do a first flight and do an update period and that's what we've done.
That will be all through the flight program.
The five test planes are expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the second remaining following shortly after, the company said
Still, analysts are skeptical customers may start operating a CSeries aircraft after its first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has stated that it has evaluated the Access in Service (EIS) schedule and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of flight testing – although in line with Bombardier's internal schedule – reinforces our view that service in entry will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended Sept. 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue dipped marginally to $4.1 billion from $4.2 billion.
According to analysts Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, 10 cents per share and revenue of $4.56 billion were expected to yield revenue.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft maker said 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, down from 57 a year ago
Net orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on Sept. 30, no change from Dec. 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the lower-order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenue dropped 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier said the division, the world's largest train maker, had revenue up nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The transport unit orders were backlogged at $32.6 billion of nearly September 30, up marginally from December 31.
Some large contracts in the margins of the transport division were also affected by execution issues.
The new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter, executives said.
Shares of Bombardier, in which Google Inc Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichett announced the board's joinment, were down 8.5 percent at C$4.83 in mid-afternoon trading on Thursday.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Parents of Intersex Kids Can Choose 'Gender Undetermined' of Their Kids
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognise a third gender for children born with impeccable genitalia.
Now, newborn children will not be randomly assigned male or female.
The new law does not require parents to declare the gender of such children, which allows them to declare the gender as "undetermined" or "unspecified" on the child's birth certificate.
The new law aims to reduce pressure on parents who may hasten decisions regarding sex-determination surgery for newborns, and fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to the BBC, an intersex man said years later, "I am neither man nor woman." "
I will remain a wounded, stained patch made by doctors.
It is estimated that one in every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that are investigated for disorders of sexual development, a collective term used for an abnormal chromosome, gonads (ovaries or testes), or abnormally developed penis.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still poorly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when sex determination cannot be done, it is better to use the best information available to assign sex and monitor the child's psychological and physical development before undergoing surgery, if such a situation arises.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a New York City psychologist who specializes in gender-identity matters, said Germany's new law "appears to be a good thing." "
Intersex children create moral confusion.
"Some people are in a life-threatening situation that requires surgery, but that doesn't happen to most children. "
You can specify the gender without surgery, and then see how the identity develops.
The science of figuring out how a penis will develop in a baby is not very accurate.
Nobody can give a proper answer as to why this happens.
It's kind of a puzzle about why people are gay.
A report filed before the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people as distinct from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not gender-related but related to their biological composition, which is neither explicitly male nor female but is either combined or not clearly defined It would have been.
These characteristics may exhibit secondary sexual characteristics themselves, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast, and height; Primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitalia; or chromosomal structure and hormones.
The report provides an overview of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and discrimination crimes.
Now there are special camps for boys with non-conforming sex.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to mark themselves as male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian Norrie May-Welby became the world's first recognised "genderless" person after winning a legal appeal for "unspecified" gender status for life.
According to the Ministry of Interior, the German passport will also have a third designation as X for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to news reports on France 24, issues related to gender are still controversial in neighboring France.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this strictly Catholic country signed a petition calling for "gender theory" to be withdrawn from school textbooks.
The U.S. website Catholic Online also opposes Germany's law, saying, "While the world is moving into a state where gender is a self-chosen choice but not a sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in opposite directions." "
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told Baby Joan that she would love to see the children have the sex assigned at birth.
"Parenting without additional boundaries can be very stressful, especially if you don't even know the gender your child has," she said on the parenting website. "
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites (bisexual), named after the handsome Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than about a decade ago, the medical world regarded gender as a slate that could be erased and then written off.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, realizing that gender identity is complicated, and sometimes it can be the mistake of physicians who don't know how children will feel about their gender slotifications when they grow up.
"In the mid-twentieth century, we used to call it a "psychiatric emergency," says Drescher.
When these children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist; you used to call a surgeon.
The existing theory about the treatment of children with ambiguous genitalia was presented by Dr. John Money of John Hopkins University, who considered gender to be legible.
He coined the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental cues – how parents raise a child – interact with a child's genes and hormones to determine whether to identify as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as "John/Joan," his theories became disputed.
He advised the parents of a child whose penis had accidentally lost during circumcision to have the child completely sterilized, remove his testicles and bring him up like a girl.
Drescher said, "Money presented that case as a successful case of transition, but that did not happen. "
At the age of 15, the child reconverted himself to a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said some physicians are still "following the same pattern."
But with the advent of the internet in the years after 1990, individuals undergoing these penis surgeries began to come out as "not happy with the results".
Such was the case with Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana who was married to XY. The male was born with chromosomes, but his genitalia was ambiguous.
Physicians clearly didn't understand whether his penis was small, or that his clitoris was large, but they were certain he could never live a "content life" as a male.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and he was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
She told ABCNews.com, "I knew I wasn't a girl. "
I wasn't happy, but it was very hard to question.
At the age of 18, she was going to have a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and feeling something amiss, she asked for medical records.
This revealed him the horrific truth.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce D.S.D. She was born with a baby boy, which prevented her body from making enough testosterone, due to which her genitals could not develop properly.
After learning the truth, he became a male again, took testosterone supplements and had his breasts removed.
He became infertile due to surgery.
Today, he explains his perception of intersex individuals to normalize people in an organization called the Interface Project.
But Anne Tamer-Mattis, executive director of the California-based advocacy group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that German law "invites skeleton and stigma." "
"A lot of activists think Germany's law will push parents to make quick decisions and assign the child to "undetermined," she says. "
We fear this will encourage intervention.
We think that instead of waiting, specifying male or female gender is a better process.
But we do not know how the law will play its role, so we can only speculate.
Tamer-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognised in the third gender". "
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about legal gender," he said. "
German law specifies it at birth.
This is not a battle fought by newborn children at this time.
When they grow up, they can make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist whose daughter has a sexual development disorder and who helps hundreds of others in support groups, said Germany's law would "give power to both parents and children." "
Baratzi's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she was diagnosed with a DSD called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. was.
Since her androgen receptor was defective, Katy developed female traits.
She has a vagina in her body but not a uterus or ovaries.
Katy, now 29, is married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she hopes to become a mother through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents not to make decisions on their own in haste," Baratz said. "
It provides them proper understanding and time by some testing before writing them 'male' or 'female'.
In this way, you live well - raise the child, love the child.
You have a cute baby and have fun.
We don't need to rush through surgery that cannot be returned.
"It brings children into the decision-making process and frees parents from motivational anxiety because they don't believe they are doing okay," he said. "
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with -- and that would be a very good thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.

Clive Palmer claimed that PM was not aware of the parental leave scheme. Tony Abbott's interest conflicts
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said Prime Minister Tony Abbott's conflict of interest with the parental leave scheme because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in dispute over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has made the claim, while attempting to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial in determining when to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have conflicts of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can personally benefit from the policies.
Mr. "They may have a significant conflict of interest in the matter of paid parental leave, because if any of their daughters were to become pregnant, they would have a direct interest whether or not they get leave," Palmer said. "
Two months after the election, the Election Commission officially declared Mr. Palmer was declared the winner of Fairfax's Sunshine Coast seat by 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a refurbishment of the election count to speed up the process.
Tony Aaut's daughters Française and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we vote?
"We have to have a better system. "
Why can't we have a system where we fill in our details on the computer, vote instantly and at 6:30 in the evening we have the result?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballot papers.
Is it because, if a person does not like him, the disciples can destroy him?
In today's era, using a pencil seems absolutely absurd.
The Election Commission is studying the options for electronic voting and has recently released a Joint Discussion Paper with New Zealand.
59-year-old Mr. Palmer said her policies include building an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and that she would take her new assignment "very seriously".
Public office is meant for public service.
"We don't need any other award other than the history prize that we can serve the community at this critical time. "
George Keravan: Euro dissolution gave Scots a choice
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that the EU will not be able to do so. Independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel area across Europe as a condition of membership of the EU.
Stories indicate passport controls on Berwick and the border of barbed wire on Hadrian's walls.
The truth is that the Strathclyde paper described the potential economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, although – predictably – it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone describe that the E.U. Members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as needed.
Since Scotland is no longer a Schengen area, Brussels will actually have affordable discounts for perpetual non-compliant Brussels in exchange for getting what they want from Scotland.
So, again, the non-story.
And the thing that has been stuck for so long has frozen. The first thing I heard was "freedom means passport control" baseless news almost 40 years ago.
Yet the interesting point was lost in retelling this interesting old story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to bid for Europe anyway?
Why buy and sell London's yoke for Brussels, especially now?
Here's the real European news: the great, post-war plan to unify Europe has finally stalled.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Throughout the EU In the E.U. Parties dedicated to opposing the EU or shutting down the euro as a common currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany party – founded only this year – came suddenly and won nearly five million votes in the September federal election, effectively ousting the Free Democrats (the equivalent of our own Lib Dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build a federal Europe.
But, the current economic crisis proved to be a radical changer.
The harsh regulations imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, as well as barriers imposed on national economies through compliance with the uniform currency, have led many to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis did not have much role in the excessive budget deficits of national governments - this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of German exporters to its members – something that German politicians want to maintain.
Without the possibility of a domestic currency devaluation, southern Europe finds itself at an inherent loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public spending – which has been encouraged by Berlin.
Far beyond the current budget and currency problems is deep European productivity morbidity.
As a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels – to provide French and German energy firms discounts on consumers' expense, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times for gas than the United States.
This is the crippling cost loss, which we have already seen in Grengemouth.
Even with all wages in the world being frozen, the European petrochemicals industry needs to be cheaper in the U.S. The shale cannot avoid being affected by gas.
As a result, a sense of revolt is being flouted among the people, especially in France, which was once a part of the EU. He was a major fan.
After the war, France's top politicians called for the EU. He saw it as a way to control Germany, and to provide Paris with a bill equivalent to Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport to political legitimacy, and has imposed its own economic policies on Europe, causing France's economy to waver.
The result: Marine Le Pen's right-wing, E.U. The rival National Front has won the recently held by-election, pushing the ruling Socialists to the third place.
The Front is currently the most popular party in France with 24 per cent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that disintegration for the left will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Le Pen doing with his new found fame among French whites, working-class?
The group will meet next year's EU. Elections are used in the European Parliament to amend the EU. The anti-common currency wants to create an anti-currency bloc.
If, as is very possible, in these elections the EU will not be able to win If the opposition parties do well, this type of bloc could influence the European Parliament for the first time.
My point of view is this: soon the EU will be in Europe. The confluence of anti-currency sentiment and anti-currency sentiment will kill the euro.
The euro will not be completely wiped out, but it will return to some form of retail "Europe of (sovereign) nations" backed by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its retaining economies could retain the euro, but France and Southern Europe would revive their currencies.
I expect the U.K. to grow closer with the U.S. Keep yourself away from this project.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific signals that Britain will be left out in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland after all this?
We can choose to remain (necessarily) the territory of Little England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can do better in a loose European system, provided we have our own currency.
Non-federal states will find it easier to get along with other like-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic independence while following the Norwegian path.
SNP in Scotland The government – remarkably – has been the most successful anti-austerity political campaign in Europe, winning a surprise majority in 2011 on the basis of opposing (and implementing) cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dame coalition.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, in which case it would have to accept the austerity rules imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
So you thought travel agents were of the past century, thank the internet?
The flight center is taking this trend forward.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, expecting record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects its full-year underlying profit from tax to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared to a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If the target is met according to current guidance, it would be a 12 to 17 percent increase over the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said Flight Centre posted an 8 per cent profit in the first half, and made a good start in the second half, especially in Australia and the UK. In non-business travel.
"So far, 10 of our countries are profitable, and many are on a record full-year earnings trajectory before interest and tax contributions. "
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually our most profitable centres.
In Australia, the leisure business regained momentum in the second half, offset by a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, the U.K. In the U.S. too, the flight centre's leisure business performed well, while corporate clients were spending less.
U.S. business had recouped its losses in its seasonally weaker first half, and is expected to deliver a third consecutive full year of profit.
Flight Center shares were up 3 cents at $38.20 yesterday.
The bird was released back into the wild by air transport for protection from the North Sea rig
The bird found dead on the North Sea oil rig has been released back into the wild from the shore by air transport.
The waterrail bird was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen before being recuperated by the Scottish SPCA to its rescue centre in Eloa.
Centre manager Colin Sedan explained: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea. "
The bird seems to have been tired and took shelter on the oil rig.
He further explained that: "It was unable to fly again so we were contacted for help. "
The water rail was healthy and fit before it was released.
Nita Ambani, wife of India's biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani, is celebrating her 50th birthday on 1 November 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organized a big party on this occasion.
Many big Bollywood stars arrived in Jodhpur to attend this party. On the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen catching a flight to Jodhpur at Mumbai Airport.
These stars include Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapur, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra, Rahul Bose etc.
Obviously, when such big names join the party, you can guess how big this event will be.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore during the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In fact, contrary to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) when Atal Vihari Vajpayee was PM, there was a period when no advertisement was issued by the government on Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of the 182-metre tall Statue of Unity at Kevadiya in Gujarat on Thursday, Modi said, "Earlier, there was no advertisement on Sardar Patel's birth anniversary.
DAVP records show that the UPA spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on Sardar Patel's advertisements.
When asked about Modi's claims, Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari said that BJP's PM candidate does not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring out any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this happened due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth anniversaries and death anniversaries of members of the Nehru-Gandhi family every year.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore on print advertisements for Mahatma Gandhi's birth and death anniversaries, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When Manish Tewari was asked about this difference, he said, "It should not be seen from the perspective of spending on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including things like the size of the ad or the rate of the ad for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which those opposing are trying to take over the legacy of a great leader without even knowing about it.

Supreme Court endorses Obama healthcare law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. The Supreme Court today declared the healthcare law named after Barack Obama as constitutional.
By 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of a separate order in the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act – which would require citizens to buy health insurance before 2014 or penalize – that it was constitutional under the government's power to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while the other justices Scalia, Thoss, Alito and Kennedy dissented.
The court also upheld the remaining 2,700-page articles of the law, saying the health care law's requirement that states increase Medicaid eligibility or that they lose all federal Medicaid funding is not unconstitutionally coercive.
This petition was moved by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Businesses to stop this law.
During the 2012 initial session, the law was opposed by all major Republican presidential candidates, including presumptive nominee Mitt Romney.
Australian woman appeals against Thai jail term
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been jailed for 15 days in Phuket for falsely accusing a taxi driver of assaulting her, appealing the decision and getting bail.
On June 15, the Phuket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Bamford guilty of falsely accusing Thai police of attempting to stop him with two other men by a local taxi driver on the morning of Sunday 10 June.
But later CCTV was installed. Footage showed that she had safely returned to the hotel after separating from her Australian boyfriend.
After being questioned by Phuket police for two days, Bamfort admitted to fabricating the story.
He was kept in a local police cell before the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison at a low-security detention center on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist his daughter.
Tunks told Sydney's Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "very concerned" about their daughter's care and wanted to bring her back to Australia.
"It has undoubtedly been an anxious time for us, but we hope she is back home as soon as possible," Tunks said. "
Bamphod has appealed against the sentence order, and bail has been granted at 50,000 baht.
Reports in Australia said she was holidaying at a holiday resort in Krabi in southern Thailand.
Legal sources in Thailand said Bamford's case was being fought by a local prosecutor in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could result in the court extending his sentence order to two years and forcing him to remain in adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also acquit in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
Snow Dane ready to "cooperate" with Germany on US vigilance
Edward Snow Dane, a US intelligence whistleblower, has declared that the German is willing to travel to Berlin to provide evidence to parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander fail to answer about its activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Belle met Mr Snow Dane in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum to speak about his testimony in Germany.
The lawmaker, in a letter presented by Mr Snow Dane before the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the results of my efforts are authentically positive, my government considers dissent as defective, and offers no defence which is an attempt to criminalize political speech with felony charges."
However, speaking the truth has not been a crime.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dane said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charges, filed by the US Department of Justice, include stealing from intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Friedrich, the German Minister of Internal Affairs, told Online Time: "Mr. Snow Dane has been willing to talk to German authorities, so we have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure after claims that the NSA has bugged Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Thomas Opperman, MP who is chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversees intelligence. If there were an opportunity to hear Mr. Snow Dane as a witness, "without completely ruining relations with the US and bringing them in danger," then it should also be taken.
Mrstraw Belle, a lawmaker from Germany's Green Party, posted a photo of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on his Twitter feed.
He was on his trip to Russia with two German journalists.
Srestray Belaney said that, according to the former NSA's contractor lawyer, Snow Dane is not able to return to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snow Dane testified in Germany he would be "safe" there requiring assurances, the MP said.
Mr. Snow Dane said in his letter that he had "suffered a fierce and sustained campaign" and was forced to leave home.
However, he said he was "delighted and overwhelmed" by the world-wide reactions "towards his work of political expression."
World citizens as well as high officials – including the United States – have judged the revelation of an irresponsible system of widespread oversight of a public service.
The letter expands a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Killing mosquitoes to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, filariasis is going to be expensive.
The state government is going to triple the tax on repellents, mats, liquids used to kill mosquitoes.
The proposal to increase the tax will be placed before the cabinet soon.
The government, which is struggling with financial crisis, is looking for every possible way to increase earnings these days.
A resource committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Urban Development Minister Mohammad Azam Khan to improve the financial health of the government.
According to sources, in the recent meeting of the resource committee, the committee rejected many proposals related to increasing taxes, whose implementation would have a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has given the green signal to the proposal to increase the tax on mosquito repellents, coils, mats and liquids.
There is a proposal to triple the tax on these.
Currently, there is a four percent VAT and one percent additional tax on these.
Now 12.50 percent VAT and 1.50 percent additional tax is proposed on these.
The government is estimated to get additional revenue of about Rs 14 crore from this.
Proposal to increase tax on tendu leaves: Although the Commercial Tax Department has been in favor of increasing the tax on tendu leaves from five percent to 14 percent to increase tax revenue income, the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the related proposal.
The committee believes that tendu leaves are used to make beedi that is smoked by people from lower strata.
Similarly, the committee has not given the green signal to increase the tax on electronic goods like transmission wire, etc., saying that it can affect the general public by making electricity expensive.
The committee has also not considered the proposal to impose a green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.

Gazprom's Alexey Miller described the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marked the start of Europe's largest energy projects, the head of Gazprom said.
"Today a historic event has happened: construction started on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe. This was stated by Gazprom President Alexey Miller in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a core element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream will diversify Russia's export routes to Europe.
Officials said a dispute over the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where most of Russia's gas supplies to Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant the elimination "forever" of the gambling geopolitical risks associated with transit countries.
When the entire project becomes operational in 2015, Bulgarian customers will get gas from South Stream at discounted rates.
Gazprom said construction should begin in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Report: Hillary Clinton Considering Biden's Dumping Obama Campaign.
According to the New York Times, advisers close to President Barack Obama have secretly considered Hillary Clinton in place of Biden for vice presidential ticket for 2012.
The most notable explosion in Revelation is that of the heavily anticipated 2012 campaign tome by Mark Halperin and John Helemann, "Double Down: Change the Game 2012."
The Times obtained a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that top advisers to the president held "extensive group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to learn whether the dumping Biden could help Obama's declining hopes of re-election.
According to Times national political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book gives full details of the efforts of the chief of the officials in the campaign and the White House, the former White House staff chief for the name, Bill to find out how the transition of former Secretary Clinton from vice president affects the poll.
The potential switch was a pretty much kept secret within the infrastructure of the Chicago campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxelrod and David Palauffe — knew the change was under consideration.
The "double down" claim that Dale attempted to replace Biden, despite his personal rapport, before finally making the decision when his information suggested that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dale confirmed that the administration did indeed consider Clinton replacing him with Biden.
"I said the whole scene, and one of them, was this," Dale told the newspaper.
You remember, when the presidency was in jeopardy, we were in a situation like, "Holy Christ, what else will we do?"
While Dale described the research as a "caution," Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign made significant investments in finding out how much dividend the bet would yield if the poll was held.
"Campaigns don't spend money on voting and focusing groups like they are seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dale if his boss knew about a possible reshuffle.
While Dell said he "did not think the president was aware of the potential change," the former chief of staff acknowledged that it was "possible" that Obama knew about it.
"Double Down" Definitive: Won't answer whether the political investigation led to Obama's desk? Martin said more.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn't know about the Biden dumping ticket research.
"Possibly," Martin said.
Today he will meet the families of those killed in a rally in Patna last Sunday.
In view of Narendra Modi's visit to Patna again a week after the blast, strict security arrangements have been made everywhere.
Police conducted strict checks on the route of Modi's visit and the meeting venues.
People coming to meetings will be monitored by the police.
The Gujarat Police force, NSGIB and state police will oversee security.
Modi's security circle will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised on the BJP's ashti kalash yatra taken out for those killed in the Patna blast.
State Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has accused the BJP of trying to spoil the atmosphere.
The Congress has re-nominated all the old MLAs.
The list includes six old faces and two new faces.
Among the new faces, Nirmala Sapre from Bina assembly constituency in Sagar district and Pratapsingh Lodhi from Jabera assembly constituency in Damoh district have been given a chance.
Three MLAs from Sagar, two from Tikamgarh and one from Chhatarpur have been given tickets again.
In Sagar, Govind Singh Rajput from Surkhi, Arunoday Chaubey from Khurai and Narayan Prajapati from Banda have been re-nominated as candidates.
In Tikamgarh, Yadavendra-Singh from Tikamgarh, Brijendra Singh Rathore from Prithvipur and Vikramsingh Nati Raja from Rajnagar in Chhatarpur have been given tickets.
All of them are sitting MLAs from these constituencies.
After the first list of BJP and Congress decided here, there will be a fight between new faces from both parties in Bina.
In Bina, BJP's Mahesh Rai and Congress' Nirmala Sapre are face to face.
In Tikamgarh's Prithvipur, sitting Congress MLA Brijendra-Singh Rathore is pitted against former minister Late Sukhbir Singh Rathore. Sunil will be married to Nayak's wife Anita Nayak.
Rajnagar sitting MLA Vikramsinh Nati Raja will be challenged by BJP's Ramakrishna Kusmaria.
Khurai MLA Arunoday Choubey and BJP MP Bhupendra Singh are face to face.
BJP's young leader Parul Sahu is pitted against Surkhi MLA Govind Rajput.
Guillaume Nicklocks' adaptation of Dennis Diderot's novel details the best production design and time period, but it goes on to be more than it should have been.
Set in France in the 1760s, the novel tells the tragic story of a young nobleman named Suzanne who is sent to a convent by his family.
When she rebels, she suffers extreme cruelty at the hands of the arbitrary sadistic Mother Superior, and becomes an object of sensual attraction to another.
This movie never goes into sensuality or sensation – and that's the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the storytelling, there is also a risk of it becoming a boring film for the audience.
Own railway found in U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels has been found between the USA and Mexico, with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. officials have described the 4ft by 3ft tunnel as one of the most complex secret passageways ever discovered.
The tunnel is approximately the zigzag length of six football pitches, which connect the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and San Digo, U.S.A. (b) of the Formula for the Benefit of Nature
The area is filled with warehouses alike, which makes it easy to hide a truck being filled with drugs.
Officials said the tunnel was closed before any drugs passed through it.
According to court records, authorities seized eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three men, who officials said were working as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing them.
If convicted, they face sentences ranging from 10 years in prison to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogales, Arizona, take advantage of vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major thoroughfare discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered since the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug mafia groups to see how to get the product to consumers faster.
In 2010, officials found a nearly 700-yard stretch lined with rail track that stretched from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to San Diego warehouses.
There was an exchange of greetings between the two at the cabinet meeting.
At the end of the meeting, Singh praised the chief minister's speech at the Chintan Shivir for his counter-attack on Narendra Modi.
About his speech, he also said that he has no other emotion in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be faced firmly.
The chief minister also had the same expression on his face that he took Singh's speech positively.
It is known that Singh had urged the Chief Minister to give respect to the workers at the Chintan Shivir and save them from the alleged harassment of the officers.
However, he also said that he is ready to be dismissed from the cabinet to keep his point.
However, after the opinion that emerged in the Chintan Shivir, there is a possibility of a fresh consideration in the matter of appointing workers to government posts.
At the camp, state JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in the 20-point committees will be announced soon.
He also indicated that the list was almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will inspect the list at his own level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in making the list.
If needed, the list will be reshuffled extensively to accommodate old and committed workers.
It is a common allegation of MLAs and MPs that their opinion was not taken in making the list of nominations.
The names of people who came much later from other parties have been registered in the list while many important workers active since the days of Samata Party have remained neglected.
Halloween 2013: By the Numbers
When I was little, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Nowadays, I'm more than greedy
I didn't even sign on to give the candy out of my apartment for the past two years and probably won't this year either.
But statistics show that I am a black sheep when Halloween arrives
According to the National Retail Federation, most Americans are actually celebrating Halloween with $158 million. , $6.9 billion will be spent on candyand costumes and decorations.
One thing I've always seen is everyone. Halloween trends.
According to NRF, out of the total spending of $6.9 billion, apparel spending is estimated at $1.2 billion
This year everyone is angry with sexy inanimate objects.
Women do not have to practice prostitution; Because it is also sexy food like pizza, hamburgers and carrots
For men, I hope to have lots of zombies, and thanks to the moving dead, Space will create our Instagram feeds for men this year.
According to Google, the most searched costumes will be zombies, batmen, robbers and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with being traditional.
Last year we dressed the dogs and to our surprise, we weren't alone.
According to NRF, Americans will literally spend $330 million for pet dress.
It's ironic that a lot of hotdogs are with dogs.
We don't look around when it comes to candy.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion this year, according to the Nielsen company.
Hairshi Bars, Lollipops, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark Bar are worth around £600 million.

That is the individual kernels of maize about 9 billion.
It's a secret. To solve so far
Nothing is more elemental than Halloween haunted houses.
They were best named, "Terror Behind the Wall (which, in fact, is a prison), "Squeak-o-Scream" and were like "House of Shock."
According to the American government, there are in fact, 1200 officially sanctioned haunted houses in the United States that generate 500 million revenues. And that horrible nice picture that your friend puts on Facebook and the guy who likes and comments on seeing you is nice face.
Finally, let's talk pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a jack-o'-lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – it's something we've done since we were little.
Luckily for us, the "baby in a pumpkin trend" started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving these guards and not settling with them.

Jack-O-Slowly Gently Withering Lantern on his front porch probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for additional credit, call Tim and Susan Matisdo in Napa, Calif., and try to carve up their 2,032-pound pumpkin.
Some people are born with silver spoons, while some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One of such personalities is the late . Dhirubhai Ambani's also comes.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Govardhandas Ambani, who was posted as a teacher in a school in Chorwad, a small village in Gujarat, was born on December 28, 1932.
Dhirubhai was the third among five siblings.
The family has five children Ramniklal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to leave studies after high school.
Dhirubhai started helping the house financially in childhood.
At this time he used to set up a bhajia shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited by the number of tourists visiting here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, at the age of 17, he reached the city of Aden in Yemen by a ship called Kabota.
Here his elder brother Ramniklal had made all the arrangements for him, so he had no problem in getting a job abroad.
But something else was going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954 they returned to their homeland.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try his luck with 500 rupees in his pocket.
And this is where his business journey began.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At this time he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
Currently, his sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are handling his sultanate.
Like the father, today the names of these two brothers are also among the international level businessmen.
Who does not know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.
Is Europe's upper class ready to do business with the UK?
In April, Business for Britain was launched and pledged to bring businesses together and determine what the U.K. would be able to do with the UK. The employment and prosperity builders of the EU What changes do you want to see in our relationship with you?
To that end, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders, asking them what would be the impact of the EU. What are his thoughts about the UK business with the U.S.
U-Gov sourced the views of 1,000 business leaders, representing the UK of business size, sectors and locations.
The findings of this survey may be surprising to a lot of people.
We found that a large proportion of businesses now want to export out of Europe, and focus on countries that are modernizing and growing, while the EU wants to export out of Europe. Member countries are stagnating.
They want the government to prioritise new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than the EU. He was entangled in a long and arduous process of reforming the mystical institutions.
When asked for their views on specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that Westminster should regain control of these decisive qualities.
General dissatisfaction with the single market was easily seen, with businessmen arguing that the value of Brussels regulation far outweighs the benefits of remaining part of Europe's trading sector – even among the big businessmen who traditionally favored European companies, 40 percent agreed.
Finally, and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly want the UK, the EU to be in a position to do so. Instead of politics, trade based relations and treaties should move forward on the path of change.
The findings, seen across levels across major business groups, demonstrated that businessmen are driving toward a "meaningful change" that is the highest in the U.K. Give back its lost power.
It has a very high price – the issue of treaty change and getting a better deal for Britain has made the EU in the referendum. It changed 16 percent of the vote in favor of retention.
The Prime Minister should be in no doubt: this survey shows that the British businessman, the EU, is in a position to be in the middle of the world. We support his plan to negotiate the terms of Britain's membership in the U.S.
It also showed that businessmen would change the current balance of power to the U.K. Let's hope to renegotiate making a meaningful change in favor of the U.S.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and is increasingly becoming imperative, as the eurozone moves in the direction of a centered economy and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businesses this means a new focus on business and a fundamental change in Brussels' regulatory methodology.

According to The Star newspaper, the new bill would give the government "strict control over the media", while The Standard said democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya had been a "severe blow" and called the bill cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security following the attack by an Islamist gunman at the Westgate Shopping Mall in September.
Kenyan media aired security camera footage of squads sent to the site of the attack, showing them purposefully looting the mall, angering officials in Kenyan media.
Police Chief David Kimayo summoned two journalists and a media person for questioning, although the summons were withdrawn after media uproar.
Under the new bill, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists can be fined up to 1 million Kenyan shillings, and the additional risk of "delisting" or not being granted official press accreditation will be different.
The Tribunal also has the power to confiscate the property of the violator in case of non-payment of penalty.
According to the Daily Nation "Most FM A fine is enough to shake the foundations of the stations. "
It also said that these measures could have devastating effects on what is described as Kenya's "vibrant blogosphere".
By silencing the media, politicians know that they can do whatever they want.
Nation journalist Mutuma Mathew describes Kenyan media as a key source of checks and balances in public life, writing: "No one will ever know. "
"Left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and bring us back to the age of hunting and accumulation," he wrote. "
Kenyan lawmakers have faced the wrath of the people in the past.
In May, he voted to reject cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission, reinstating tax-free wages, about 532,000 shillings a month, considered among the world's highest.
Obama's healthcare proposal withdrawn
Amid a barrage of criticism, President Obama yesterday retracted his oft-repeated misleading promise that "you can continue your health plan if you like it." "
With millions receiving termination notices from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading U.S. citizens in recent days.
Yesterday Obama changed his actual message.
He said in a speech in Boston that "a lot of people who have health insurance, and it's useful, can continue it." "
Addressing what he calls the "news flounder" about the removal, Obama has urged American citizens who receive this information to buy new coverage in the market.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, with the same amount of money or even cheaper than a comprehensive healthcare plan proposed.
"You'll get a better deal," he said. "
The administration has said that it should come as no surprise that 5 percent of the population that buys insurance on their own money may be forced to change their plans because their coverage does not meet the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the Homeland Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said that "I tell these American citizens directly, 'You deserve better. "
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the online marketplace since October has been "unfortunate".
"I am as frustrated and angry as anybody else," he said.
I want to gain your trust again.
Sebelius angrily uttered this sentence to a colleague sitting behind him at a House hearing yesterday after a heated exchange with Republicans, which was grabbed by a mike. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether they will need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
During the hearing that lasted more than three hours, Long repeatedly asked Sebelius why the "architect" of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily renounced government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.

Parents of Georgian teen killed in 'bizarre accident' believe their son was murdered
A Georgian teen whose body was found wrapped in a restyling mat at his high school gym believes his son was murdered, the family's attorney said Thursday.
Valdosta, G.A. K. Kendrick Johnson was found trapped in a mat standing directly behind the bleachers inside his high school gym on Jan. 11.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators had concluded that Johnson had died in an "unusual accident," but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied this.
Benjamin Crump, the attorney who presented Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com that "he fully believes his son has been murdered".
They don't believe in death the way the sheriff describes.
Crump said that he believes that this is beyond the logic of physical law and common sense. "
They feel that this conclusion is an excuse for the protection of the person or people responsible for their son's death.
He said that "he had sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned in a body bag"
U.S. Attorney General Michael Mueller said on Thursday that he is conducting a formal inquiry into Johnson's death, noting that a lot of important questions remain unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he murdered because of a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will abide by the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"My view is that environmental causes exist for a formal investigation. "
Moore told the reporter that an initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died as a result of "positional asphyxia."
According to Moore, however, a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death. "
"There are so many questions that need to be answered or confirmed. "
Moore also said he would seek the FBI to do it if he could find sufficient evidence to summon an offender or conduct a civil rights investigation into Johnson's death. They will say.
A representative was not immediately available for comment from the Londes County Sheriff's Office when contacted Thursday.
On Wednesday, a judge in southern Georgia ordered authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope the video footage will give some clues as to how he died.

Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like the chance to become Britain's prime minister again – but he admits a return is unlikely.
In the interview on the night marking the fifth anniversary of his departure from the Prime Minister's Office, Blair, 59, expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as leader, Mr. Blair largely avoided discussing British politics, restricting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as representative of the Middle East group's peacemakers.
Asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair was quoted by London's Evening Standard newspaper as saying: "Yes, sure, but it is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.

Love Glow-in-Di-Dark Ice Cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first glow-in-the-dark ice cream using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken full advantage of the sea animal to develop the perfect breakfast.
The idea came to him after reading a research paper on jellyfish, and convinced scientists in China used chemical glow to re-polish proteins.
Ice cream, by reacting with the tongue of the eater, will raise the pH level of the protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream ignites with the heat of the mouth, meaning that the more you lick, the more it will ignit.
Charlie, founder of the Lick Me I'm Delicious ice cream company, said: "It's an incredible thing but early days production would get around 2 grams of the stuff from £200".
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with a neutral pH in the tongue.
As the mouth warms, the proteins will raise the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We've been testing it for the past few months and it looks perfect to share on Halloween as it gives amazing glowing effects
This will probably be the most expensive ice cream I have made because jellyfish glitter is four times more expensive than gold
So each scoop costs me around 140 pounds .
It tastes great though.
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf.
But his next creation is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It's inherently impossible because of the ice crystals that create refraction on top of the ice cream, but I think we'll find a way to do it.
Ice cream is a utility of the fluorescent property of a jellyfish, which was synthesized by Chinese scientists

The court blocked the New York Police Department's crackdown on pause and play policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked the New York Police Department's break-and-play program requiring a judge's order and removed the judge from the case.
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal 2 & Judge Shira Schindler has said that the judge's verdict will be pending the outcome of an appeal by the city.
The judge ruled in August that it violated the constitution by barring people from his program of barring and questioning people.
The city's police department has appealed its findings and its remedial order, including the decision to assign a monitor to help change its policy and its associated training program.
The appeals court heard arguments on the request on Tuesday.
The appeals court has said that because it compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the appearance of bias in part of a series of media interviews and differed from the code of conduct for U.S. judges by the public, he committed wrongdoings so the judge should therefore be removed from the case, statements critical of the court should be answered publicly for criticizing the court.
The judge had ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and play program.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic improvements in policies, training and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program for testing body-worn cameras in some premises where most stops occur.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of people whose cases were dismissed after a police moratorium.
An oral argument on the city's appeal is scheduled for some time after it took place on 14 March 2014.
The pause and playability has been criticized with civil rights advocates.
The pause and play policy in some form has been around for decades, but mostly from black and Hispanic men, has been recorded to increase dramatically from 684,330 to an all-time high in 2011 under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg.
One lawsuit was filed in 2004 by four men, all minorities, and became a class action case.
Proponents of the NYPD's pause and changes to the play program have stated that the end of unfair practices will mold a more credible and effective police force and may affect other police department policy access.
Opponents say the changes will lower police morale, but will solve a broader problem of crime, money wasted and not a police force under pressure after shrinking by thousands of officers during the past decade.
The judge noted that the pause and play did not put the termination for which is constitutional, but did improve the implementation of the NYPD's stop.
If the new government continues with the policy of stopping the sale of kerosene through rations after the general elections, then kerosene will not be available at these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where kerosene sale will be stopped include Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some states of the Northeast are also preparing to stop the sale of kerosene.
According to sources in the Petroleum Ministry, the decision to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in states will be taken on two grounds.
The first is the rapid development of electricity connections in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, in the states where LPG connections have been given to most of the rural households, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped.
The Petroleum Ministry has made concrete preparations in this regard.
Sale of PDS kerosene has already been stopped in Delhi since October, 2013.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota of Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been reduced considerably.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilo litres to 1 lakh kilo litres.
In Uttarakhand, the kerosene quota was reduced by 70 per cent and Haryana's by about 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, no shortage of kerosene has been reported from these states.
The Ministry is admitting that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price difference between PDS kerosene and diesel is currently Rs 37.
This encourages adulteration.
In states where sale through PDS will be stopped, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing over Rs 39 a litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy in 2013-14 is estimated to be around Rs 31,000 crore.

Ben Greenman: Tenth Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People might argue about whether New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: nearly a hundred years ago humorist Frank Fay, who served as master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre at Broadway, began telling jokes directly to people sitting in crowds in a conversational manner.
Fay's quest has expanded through the years, most recently, in the New York comedy Festival.
Created and run by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the standup institution called Carolines, the festival celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, featuring more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these headliners appeared in the Carolines, and became huge successes, to a level where they became too big to be played at the club," says Hirsch. "
We built this celebration as a way to continue working with them.
This year's program includes the presence of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin, and Bill Maher, as well as the annual music and comedy benefit for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, "Stand Up for Heroes" featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby, among others.
As the festival has expanded, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many of the comedians participating in this year's festival have come from non-traditional mediums, such as Comedy Central, FX and Comedy Central. and shows coming out on smaller networks like Spike.
Nick Kroll rose to prominence with the deep-cable sitcom (FXX's gleefully Ronchi Fantasy-Football themed "The League"), and now has his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been a cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marsal the Shell with Shoes On". "
Other young comedians with different voices, including crawl and slate, (Anthony Jeselnick with a very different despairing voice, satirical, ethnicity-centric W. Earner Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
Among the most highlights of the celebration will be, an interview: David Steinberg talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a stand-up comedian, but has gone on to become a well-known television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he worked in T.V. Hosted a show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on Land.
The meeting will take place at the Town Hall, in the heart of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely the comedy DNA of all of Larry's work," Steinberg said. is in. "
He was telling me that, when he was here, sometimes he would go down the street between two buildings and thought to himself that if ever I lost all my money, I would stay here.
Moving through soil, rivers and forest to provide free medical care
Dr. Georges Weil is delivering free healthcare to rural areas of Cameroon
Weil and his team see hundreds of patients almost every weekend
West African countries don't have a lot of therapists; There is only one doctor for 5000 people
Cast your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Weil joined CNN in 2013. Let's be one of the top 10 heroes.
You can use CNN for them or anyone in the other top 10. Can vote to be the hero of the year.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Weil had seen his ailing father, conscious and unconscious, rushing to the hospital, not properly equipped to help him.
Jamel Weil was injured in a car crash near Cameroon's capital, Yaounde, in 1981.
Initially he only broke his arm, but an infection progressed to his brain, and it formed a haema that affected him for the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon," says Georges Weil. "
If we had the money we would take my father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Vail took his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals and received whatever treatment he could.
"It's not easy," Vail said. "
You leave home at 5 a.m. hoping you'll be the first to get to the hospital, but that's not the case.
There are a lot of patients there.
Some people may die while waiting.
The situation hasn't changed much since the death of Vail's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one physician for every 5000 people.
By comparison, there is one doctor for every 413 people in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many Cameroonians can't afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and the private sector accounts for nearly two-thirds of the country's expenditure on healthcare.
"Their only problem is poverty," says Vail. "
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the suffering of his father and his countrymen, Weil determined to find some solution.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers performed 700 surgeries free of charge last year.
He himself became a physician, and worked as a vascular surgeon at the Centre Hospital in Yaunde.
And he started the non-profit organization Escovime, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to about 30 people get into vans, wrap medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need medical attention.
Sometimes luck doesn't happen to them.
They have to push the vehicle forward more than once by pushing it through rivers and soil.
But when they arrive, they receive the honor of a truly hero: feasting, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
The free medical service in these villages is indeed cause to celebrate, and the well – with its big smile and endless energy – happily joins in.
The next morning, his team starts meeting hundreds of patients.
"We're meeting 500 people on each visit," Vail said. "
They come from about 60 kilometres away from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics offer a variety of medical service.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses or a free birth certificate -- this document is required at school, but many poor families can't afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school building, town hall or at home; After the procedure, the patient walks to the recovery site, making room for the next person.
The group's generator illuminates the operation room and sanitizing equipment, and Weil and his volunteers work early on Sundays.
It's a backbreaking pace, but village musicians generally help keep the crew motivated.
"They beat the drums all night to keep us awake and continue our work," Weil said. "
On Sunday, their entourage returns to the city, tired, but proud of their work.
This group – which includes Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their help can change the world for the people they help.
One person said that due to getting free hernia surgery, he would be able to go back to work.
"This will change the future of me and my family," the man said. "
In addition to running weekend clinics and working as a surgeon at the hospital, Vail also works at a private medical clinic around Yaunde at night.
He reported that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; The rest is met by private donations.
"I don't know when they fall asleep," said Katy O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and volunteer in Vail's group. "
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to make money for their organization, so that they can keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley who come from the United States and Europe to join Weil's campaign, this is an experiential opportunity that they could never get in their home country.
"We've been able to gain experimental experience in surgeries that help Dr. Weil hold tools or clean blood stains," O'Malley said. "
As a second-year medical student in the U.S., you'll never have the opportunity to do that.
Volunteer students usually pay for themselves to arrive in Cameroon, and they often come with donated medical supplies.
But after reaching Yaunde, they bear the cost of their stay, transportation, and instructions.
"There's no doubt they're heroes," O'Malley said. "
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never-ending.
For Vail, almost the same workload, is not difficulty.
Helping other people live happy lives, keeping their promises to their father, these are the things that bring them great joy.
"I'm very happy when doing this work," says Vail. "
And I think about my father.
I hope they'll see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, to ease their pain.

In this regard, a proposal has been sent to the government by the ADA, which is going to be stamped soon.
Surrounded by the Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, this historic city no longer has a plot left on which ADA can plan a big house.

Mozambique's security concern grows as powerful figures clash
Accompanied by a statue of Mozambique's founding President Samora, who stared down at them, thousands of people gathered in central Maputo for a rare public demonstration for the slogan of peace.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa De Susa, chief executive of an investment company.
Fearful about her country's future, she changed her corporate attire to a T-shirt with "We Demand Security" printed in Portuguese and joined the crowd in the capital, Independence Square, on Thursday.
For two weeks clashes between government forces and Ray Namco have been reported almost daily, since more than 20 years since a peace agreement was reached.
Ray NaMo was a notorious rebel of a movement backed by the apartheid government of white-ruled Rhodesia and South Africa, initially as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace accord, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country is unlikely to return to a full-blown conflict, but recent events have emboldened foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for the fast-growing economy the Northwest's vast offshore gas reserves and coal reserves could bring in investments of more than $50bn next year by some of the discovered companies including Rio Tinto, Brazil's Vail, Eni.
The ruling Frelimo party, the dominant political force since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for the tensions.
Ray Namo says the government launched the latest conflict by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La province, the traditional one Ray Namco stronghold, on October 17
Attacking and then advancing former rebels prompted government forces to attack Renamo bases and try to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, the group's leader, Fernando Mazhang, Ray Namo's spokesman, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Ray Namo for triggering the confrontation, accusing soldiers of attacking.
President Armando Gibuzan has sought to dismiss concerns about instability.
Mr Gibuzhan told AFP, the French news agency, on Wednesday that Dhakama had seen himself as a "loser" "whatever it is that his forces remain trying to prove that he can impose his own judgment on the government."
Both Free Limo and Ray Namo insist that they want to avoid war .
Mr. Mazhang was quoted as saying that Ray NaMo had cancelled the 1992 peace deal but has since become a matter of concern again.
He told FT that means that the agreement is not being awarded by the Free Limo
Our vision is to come back to negotiations, but seriously," Mr. Mazhang said.
Previous talks between the two sides did little to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about two big men fighting side by side (Jibuzhan and Dhakama)," said Yussef Han, a lecturer at the London Open University and a Mozambican expert.
Neither of them are good negotiators nor have they necessarily been willing to make kinds of concessions.
Ray Namo, which has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already spoken about boycotting the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted his use of force as an attempt by a morbid movement to win concessions and economic plunder from the government.
Ray Namo's share of voting has been declining since 1992, while a new party, formed by a former Ray Namo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), is expected to improve its performance in the elections.
Mr Mazhang says Mr. Jibuzhanko — who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year — wants to destroy the country's democracy.
"He doesn't want multi-party democracy, he doesn't want to give up the presidency because he doesn't want peace, he doesn't want transparent elections," Mr. Mazhang said.

Pope Francis to name first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will create a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his term on February 22.
Cardinals are the highest-ranking clergy in the Catholic Church, ranked only below the Pope, and are the ones who choose the Pope, so Francis will appoint the first group of his men who will ultimately help choose his successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals there right now.
By the way, once they reach the age of 80, cardinals are no longer allowed to participate in the election of a pope—they fall into the group of 120 "cardinal electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all current cardinals will be held, which is called the Pope's Assembly.
"Pope Francis has decided to hold the February Papal Council in advance, so that it will be easier to plan other meetings involving cardinals from different countries of the world," Lombardi said. "
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electorates was expected to drop by February.
He said that the Pope normally announces the number of cardinal electors as low as 120, as many cardinals as he wishes, and the number of cardinals over the age of 80 as he wishes.
Valero said that next year's papal meeting would be important because it would be the first papal meeting since Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of prejudice towards Europe and Italy in particular.
"It will be interesting to see if a new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance," he said.
Forty percent of the Romans in South America are Catholics, but their number among the cardinals is very small.
They will also be the first cardinals to be elected after Francis formed the Council of Cardinals – a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
Earlier, the Pope used to decide everything on his own.
"Right now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to assist him," Valero said. "
He said it was "possible" that Francis would seek advice from the Cardinals.
But we've not been in this situation before – it's brand new.
Valero said that normally popes give the rank of cardinal to bishops of large places, but Francis was "a complete surprise — so we don't know whose name they will proclaim." "
Foreign workers on a 457 visa can undergo a "credentials" test
The government is considering a "credentials" test for foreign workers on the 457 visa, as it aims to extend a stricter proceeding.
If adopted, the test would be enforced through a criterion aimed at preventing 457 from being used to fill unskilled positions in Australia or to disguised delivery to family and friends.
A Government discussion paper was released today, condemning the rhetoric of the Government about foreign workers, former Labour MP was arrested. Maxine McCue said today that it could infuriate Australia's neighbours.
He told the American India Institute today that "foreigners are reaching the end of the queue" and the loud rhetoric about "Australians get jobs first" is a very unpleasant repetition at a time when unions are demanding a safe labour market. "
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been protected – and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the area saw an echo of that historical evidence.
The discussion paper outlines 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration, Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met with officials on traffickers, has implemented five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "authenticity" criterion is adopted, the visa applicant may be examined "whether the nomination is genuine in circumstances where the nominee is a relative or personal partner of the person relevant or the owner of the person sponsoring the visa".
Businessmen may need to keep count of the number of 457 visa holders, as the first businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a suspected heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's distraught nine-year-old son had accompanied him to Australia on a voyage, and his father died on Wednesday and was comforted by an adult cousin who was on the ship.
Australian authorities rushed the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
