When hydrogen atoms are merged (or fusion) to make heavy elements, the stars provide light and heat from the energy that is released.
Scientists are working to build reactors that can create energy in the same way.
This, however, is a very difficult problem to solve and it will take several years before we could build useful fusion reactors.
Due to surface tension, the steel needle floats on the surface of the water.
Surface tension occurs because the particles of water on the surface of the water are attracted to each other much faster than each other, as they are from the particles of air present above the water.
Water molecules form an invisible skin on the surface of the water, due to which things like needle float over the water.
The blades on the modern ice skate are double-shared and have a concave hollow shape between them. Its two edges maintain a better grip on the ice even when bending.
Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, so that the blade tilts on one side or the other and the edge that is in contact with the snow also twists.
For this reason the skates turn. If the skates bend to the right, the skater turns to the right, if the skates bend to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To get back to their previous energy levels, they have to get rid of the excess energy they got from the light.
They do this by emitting a small particle of light called photons.” 
Scientists call this process “stimulated emission of radiation”, because atoms are stimulated by loud light, emitting the photon of light and light is a kind of radiation.
The next photo shows the atoms that come out. Of course, photons are actually much smaller than photos.
Fotons are smaller than atomizing substances.
After working for hundreds of hours, the filament of the bulb burns and after that the light bulb does not work.
The light bulb needs to be replaced again. It is important to be careful to replace the light bulb.
The switch should be turned off first or disconnect the cable to correct the light.
Some of its parts when inside the socket if at that time you touch the metal base of the socket or the metal of the bulb, the metal part of the bulb can give you a serious electric shock, this is because the power flows into the socket.

The teeth of a triceratops were able to not only crush the leaves, but also very hard branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that trickertops ate cycads, a type of plant that was common in Cretaceous.
These plants look like a small palm tree with pointed crowns, thorny leaves.
Triceratops species of dinosaurs could break their leaves and twigs from their powerful beaks before eating tree stems.
Other scientists argue that these plants are very poisonous, so it is not possible to eat them. Even if today other animals like sloths and parrots (descents of Dinassor) can eat poisonous leaves or fruits.
How will the gravity of Ayo pull me? If you stand on the surface of Ayo, you will weigh less than the weight of the earth.
A person who weighs 200 pounds (90 kilograms) on earth will weigh about 36 pounds (16 kg) on the IO. Therefore, gravity shows less attractiveness on you.
The Sun does not have an earth-like surface on which you can stand. The whole sun is made up of gas, fire and plasma.
The gas becomes thinner while moving away from the center of the sun.
The outer part that appears when looking at the sun is called a photosphery (panorama). This means, “Ball of the Light”.
About 3000 years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to see that Venus had phases, just like the moon.
The arts grow due to the bright part of the Venus (or the moon) in front of the Sun. Venus arts support the principle of Copernicus that the planets orbit the Sun.
Then, a few years later in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horoux observed the transit of Venus.

The drawback of zoom lenses is that the focal complexity and the number of lenses required to achieve a range of focal lengths are much higher than that of prime lenses.
This problem is decreasing because the lens manufacturers are getting high standards in lens production.
This has made it possible to acquire higher categories of photos by zoom lenses compared to photos obtained from lenses with fixed focal lengths.
The second disadvantage of a zoom lens is that the maximum aperture of the lens is generally low.
If not flashed, it makes it harder to use cheap zoom lenses in low light.
When an attempt is made to convert a movie to DVD format, overscan is one of the most common problems.
Most televisions are designed to make the common people happy.

Beach, theme parks and campgrounds are common places where frequent entertainment-seeking tourists visit.
If a person's journey to a particular place is to know his history and culture, then this type of tourism is known as cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit different places of a particular country or they can only focus on one area.
The colonists had also called for strength after seeing this activity.
The soldiers who strengthened the front front included the first and third New Hampshire Regiment of 200 soldiers led by Colonel John Stark and James Reid (both later became generals).
Stark's men took over the fence as well as their front at the northern end of the colonists' position.
When a ditch formed on the Mystic River in the north-east of the peninsula due to low flow of water, they quickly moved from that small stone wall to the northwards the fence, which ends on the small shore of the beach.
Gridly or Stark had put a peg in front of the fence for 100 feet (30 meters) and ordered that no one would fire until the soldiers leave.
The US plan was based on joint attacks from three different places.
General John Cadvaller will begin an attention-grabbing attack against the British garrison in Bordontown to stop any of his reinforcements.
General James Ewing will take 700 militias across the river in Trenton Ferry, taking over the bridge on the Asunpink Creek and stop any enemy soldier from fleeing.
The 2,400-miled main crew will cross the river nine miles north of the Trenton and then split into two groups. Next, one group will go to Green and the other to Sullivan to attack before dawn.
With a change from a quarter to half-mile, the speed becomes of little importance and stability becomes an extremely need.
Of course, a half-mile runner of a first-class runner, a person who can take less than two minutes, should have a lot of speed, but for all the dangers, endurance must develop.
Some cross-countries running during the winter have joined gym people for the strength of the upper body, which is the best preparation for the running season.

The study found that depression, fear, and horrors mediated the relationship between pain and disability in people suffering from lower back pain.
Only the effects of destruction, not depression and fear, were on the condition of regular weekly structured PA sessions.
Those who are participating in regular activity need more support as a negative sensation of pain. This is so that they can distinguish the sharp pain and discomfort caused by normal physical movement.
The vision or ability to see depends on the visual system sensory organs or eyes.
There are many different structures of the eyes, which are in complexity depending on the needs of the organism.
Different constructions have different capabilities, sensitive to different wave-lengths and have sharpness of different degrees, as well as different numbers need different processing for an understanding of input.
A group of organisms of a particular species is called population within a given geographical area.
When all individuals of a population are similar in relation to a particular phenotypic characteristic, they are known as monomorphic.
When a person shows many forms of a specialty, he is polymorphia.
The soldier ants make colonies and houses walking in a queue in different stages.
In the nomadic phase, the ants march at night and stop at the dera during the day.
When the food is reduced, the settlement starts the Banjara phase. In this phase, the settlement makes temporary nests which are changed daily.
Each of these nomads or March lasts for about 17 days.
What is a cell? The cell word comes from the Latin word “cella”, which means “small room”, and it was first discovered by a microscopist, observing the structure of the cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and all organisms are made up of one or more cells.
Cells are so basic and important to the study of life that they are often referred to as “building blocks of life.”
The nervous system maintains homeostasis by sending nerve impulses through the body so that the blood remains uninterrupted along with the flow.
These nerve impulses can be sent to the whole body so quickly that helps to keep the body safe from any occurring danger.
Tornadoes attack a small area compared to other fierce storms, but they can destroy everything in their way.
Tornadoes uproot trees, uproot boards from buildings, and blow cars into the sky. The most violent two percent tornadoes remain for more than three hours.
These dangerous storms contain winds up to 480 km/h (133m/sec; 300mph).
Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.
However, the first real telescope was created in Europe at the end of the 16th century.
These telescopes used a combination of two lenses to make distant objects look closer and large.
Greed and selfishness will always be with us and it is the nature of cooperation that when there is a majority of profit, working as selfish will always benefit more in the short term.
Hopefully most people will feel that working together with others is their long-term best option.
Many people dream of a day when humans will be able to travel to another star and explore the other world, some people think what might happen there while some believe that there may be aliens or other organisms on other planets.
But, if ever that happens will probably not be for a very long time. The stars have spread so much that the “neighbor” is a distance of trillions of miles between the stars.
Maybe one day, your great-grandchildren or grandchildren will be standing in a very different world and thinking about their ancestors?
Animals are made up of many cells. The things they eat and digest them inside. Most animals can walk.
Only animals have brains (although not all animals have it; for example, jellyfish do not have brains).
Animals are found all over the world. They make bills on the ground, swim in the seas and fly in the sky.
A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of a living organism.
The cell comes from the Latin word cella which means a small room.
If you look at living things from a microscope, you will see that they are made up of small squares or balls.
England biologist Robert Hooke watched small squares in the cork with a microscope.
They (cells) looked like a room. He (Robert Hook) was the first to observe dead cells.
Elements and compounds can be converted from one state to another and will not change.
Nitrogen in the form of gas has the same properties as liquid nitrogen. The liquid state is denser but the molecules are still the same.
Water is the second example. The compound is made up of two molecules of hydrogen and one of the molecules of oxygen.
It has the same molecular structure whether it is gas, liquid or solid.
Although its physical position may change, its chemical condition remains the same.
Time around us is something like this, and it is still difficult to understand what we do.
Time has been studied by religious, philosophical and scientific scholars for thousands of years.
We experience time as a series of events leading to the past, becoming present from the future.
The time is also how we compare the duration of events (length).
You can mark the change of time by looking at the duplication of cyclic events. Cyclic events are something that occurs regularly frequently.
Nowadays computers are used to manipulate photos and videos.
Artificial animations can be created on the computer and such animations are being used in television and movies.
Music is recorded using a sophisticated computer to process the sound and mix together.
For a long time during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, it was believed that the first residents of New Zealand were the Maori people, hunting a huge bird called Joe Moss.
The theory then established the idea that the Maoris moved from Polinesia to a Great Fleet and moved New Zealand from Moriori, establishing an agricultural society.
However, new evidence suggests that the Moriori was a group of mainland Maori people who moved to Chaitham Island from New Zealand to develop their own distinct, peaceful culture.
There was another tribe on the Chatham Islands and these were the Maori tribesmen who had settled from New Zealand.
He called himself Moriori, then there were some clashes but in the end Mori Ori was wiped out
Individuals who have been involved for several decades helped us appreciate our strengths and passions while openly evaluating the difficulties and even failures.
Sharing their personal, family, and organizational stories while listening to individuals, we received important information in the past and about some personalities who influenced the organization's culture good or bad.
While understanding one's history is not considered to be understanding culture, it helps people to least understand where they are in the history of the organization.
By evaluating successes and knowing failures, the person participating is not only known personally but also his entire personality values, missions and the driving force of the organization.
In this example, memories and successes of the previous example of entrepreneurial behavior helped people open up to the local church with new changes and instructions.
Such success stories reduced the fears of change, creating positive inclinations towards future change.
Insertive thinking pattern is problem solving techniques that unite different ideas or areas to find a solution.
The goal of this mindset is speed, reasoning and accuracy, identifying facts, re-introducing existing technologies, and collecting information.
The most important factor of this mindset is: there is only one correct answer. You only think of two answers - right or wrong.
Such thinking is associated with special science or standard methods.
People with such thinking are logical thinking, able to remember patterns, solve problems, and work on scientific tests.
The human species is the most talented species ever reading the brains of others.
This means that we are able to successfully estimate the understanding, intention, belief, experience or desire of other human beings.
Despite these abilities, it is important to understand the intentions of others. This makes us worthy of solving the possible ambiguities of physical actions.
For example, if you see someone breaking the car window, you'll probably understand that he's trying to steal a stranger's car.
If he lost the key of his car and he was trying to break and open his own car, he should be judged differently.
MRI is based on a physics phenomenon called the Atomic Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which was discovered in the 1930s by the Felix Baloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Persell (Harward University).
In this resonance, magnetic fields and radio waves cause atoms to release small radio signals.
In 1970, medical doctor and research scientist Raymond Demedian discovered the basis for using magnetic resonance imaging as a tool for medical diagnosis.
Four years later, a patent was granted. This was the world's first patent issued in the field of MRI.
In 1977, Dr. Demedian first created the structure of the “full body” MRI scanner, which he named “indomitable”.
Asynchronous communication promotes time for reflection and response of others.
It allows students to work at their own pace and control the speed of training information.
In addition, the punctuality is low and the working hours can be changed to your preference. (Bramer, 1998)
The use of the Internet and the World Wide Web allows learners to get information all the time.
Students can send questions to the teacher at any time of the day and get an immediate answer to their question at any time instead of waiting until the face-to-face meeting is held next time.
Postmodern access to learning provides freedom from the ultimate elements. There is nothing better than this.
In fact, not a single good thing to learn is from the experience between the learner and the knowledge provider.
The television show based on learning the recent experience with all our own-to-do and information presents.
Many of us find ourselves watching a television show that makes us aware of a process or experience in which we will never participate or apply that knowledge.
We will never do a complete investigation and repair of the car, not build a fountain in the patio behind us, will not travel to Peru to see the ancient ruins, or re-read our neighbor's house.
Thanks to the fiber optic cable link and broadband satellite under the sea to Europe, Greenland is well connected to the Internet with a population of 93%.
Your hotel or host (if you're staying in a guest house or someone's home) can have a computer with a WiFi or internet connection and you will get internet cafes or public Wifis in all places.
As mentioned above, although the term “escimo” is acceptable in the United States, it is considered abusive by many non-American Arctic people, especially in Canada.
When you can hear the word used by the Greenlandic native, its use should avoid foreigners.
Greenland natives call themselves Inuit in Canada and Kalalik (multi-lift Kalleet) in Greenland.
Crime, and malice towards foreigners in general, is virtually unknown in Greenland. Even towns do not have such areas.”
