RBS suspended two forex traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their forex exchange department, receiving information from two people who are learned from the case, another indication that the global investigation by regulators in suspected manipulation of the currency market is moving at a rapid pace.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS Barclez, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators in an investigation into the world's largest financial market that exchanges $5.3 trillion each day.
Both these traders will be the first employees of RBS to be suspended as the investigation into the case, which appears to be a repeat of the Libor interbank loan manipulation scandal.
The bank has refused to comment on the suspension, confirming that the bank has received a request for information from the regulators this month.
"We are investigating this matter, and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulators," the bank had said two weeks ago.
Last month, the people who are squishy had said that RBS sent to the former trader and sent the records of emails and quick messages received from them to the UK Regulatory, Financial Ethics Authority.
The trader, Richard Euscher, left RBS in 2010, and is believed to have been discharged from the current position of the European Head of Forex Spot Trading in J.P. Morgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading in City, had gone on vacation last week, while former senior currency traders in Barclage and UBS were suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
No one of these traders has been charged with any wrongdoing.
The people who are known to be informed that Mr. Youcher's instant messaging group includes bankers from Barclage and Sitigrupt.
The UBS said it has taken action against some of its employees this week after the Swiss regulator, Finma, told that it is investigating the suspected exchange market manipulation of the foreign exchange market in multiple Swiss banks.
Globally, at least six authorities - the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland's Competition Authority of Wecow, the FCA, the Department of Justice in the US, and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority - are investigating allegations of bankruptcy on bankers to make their favourable fluctuations in the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, and Credit Suisse have also conducted an internal investigation, or received a request for information from the regulators.
Banks are closely examining the same amount of instant messaging and emails for many years in search of clues to any wrongdoing.
The news about the investigation, has created panic among traders in a sector who have been among the most profitable individuals in the trading unit of investment banks for the past several years, but they are facing the challenge this year, as opportunities for speculators have decreased due to low volatility in currencies.
Some bankers tried to suppress the matter by saying that it is impossible to manipulate the very large and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders say that this is not necessarily true.
The senior trader said that the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms despite the highly large magnitude of forex buying and selling and the increasing use of their own platforms by banks means "you can start to influence the market at a slightly lower ticket price."
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced to be re-elected from their Exchange Traded Funds desk in London to the trader this week, which had incurred a loss of around $6 million at the end of the year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperating with its regulators.
"We believe that the trader worked alone, and has been controlled," Credit Suisse said.
New politics of making board changes in municipalities has started.
Recently, the Trinamool converted into a board of the Trinamool due to the defection of the Congress-led board councillors in the Sanithia municipality of Veerbhum district.
The change took place due to the inclusion of most of the Congress councillors, including the municipality chairman, in the Trinamool.
Not only the Congress, but some councillors of the CPI(M), CPI and Forward Block have also taken the suppression of the Trinamool here.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy considers this a good sign for the party.
He said 10 Congress councillors, including Sanithia municipality chairman Virendra Parikh and Congress leader Viplav Dutta, joined the Trinamool.
Some of the Left Front, including the CPI(M), have also joined the Trinamool flag.
All of them have written to the District Magistrate under the Bengal Municipal Act that they have become part of the Trinamool and the Sanithia municipal board has also come under the control of the Trinamool as per the number force.
Rai also claims that everyone agrees with the roadmap for the development of Bengal under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee.
Leaders of other parties, including the Congress, the CPI, CPI, and Forward Block, are moving to join the Trinamool Congress.
Eligible leaders of any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
Ahead of the November 22 elections, the Trinamool's takeover of the municipal board in the Saithia municipality is considered important in political circles due to the defection of Congress councillors in the Saithia municipality.
Earlier, the Left-ruled Haldia and Nadia are also an example of the Trinamool's capture of the Congress-ruled municipal board.
When the Trinamool takes over the municipal board in the districts due to defection, those who join the party get a grand welcome at the Trinamool Bhawan in Kolkata.
Trinamool Congress general secretary Mukul Roy is excited to join the Trinamool Congress by breaking away from other parties.
Those who break away from any party are welcome to the Trinamool.
He claims that the faith of the people under the leadership of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee is increasing, as a result of which people want to join the Trinamool.
However, the main opposition CPI(M) said leaders of other parties are being intimidated.
People are joining it fearing the terror of Trinamool Congress.
The change in the board of elected local bodies is as a blow to the CPI(M) democracy.
In a democratic manner, any party has the right to increase its base, but the rationale for changing the vote on the basis of power is bound to be questioned.
The bike was parked in an unclaimed condition near the forest of Pipcho.
The police have seized the bike.
The bike belonged to Chhoti Mehta, a postman of Jharpo.
He has been placed in the state level to the election-runs and reception committees in the assembly elections.
Sachchidanand Upasane, the state vice-president, has been made the election director of Raipur Rural seat.
He has been asked to take over the office of the state and visit anywhere in the state if needed.
State BJP president Ram Sewak Paikra and general secretary Shivratan Sharma, including several office-bearers, are contesting the elections.
That is why the responsibility has been given to the devotees.
RDA president Sunil Soni has been given the charge of conducting the election of Raipur South seat.
Another contender Sanjay Srivastava has been placed on the Provincial Reception Committee.
He will help the party's star campaigner national leaders receive, and visit.
The committee also has some other ticket aspirants, including Soni.
Shyam Baisarang and Leelaram Bhojwani will conduct the election to Rajnandgaon seat.
Taking a dig at Bishnoi, the MP said that by taking pictures of a particular community by eating churma one day, no one becomes a well-wisher of the poor.
They go to different houses three times a day and eat Churma, but never preached it.
Rohtak MP Deepender Hooda on Friday took a meeting of Congress workers from Maham Halqe and said that the rally in Gohana on November 10 is very important for you and us.
The opposition will automatically realise the strength of the present government due to the crowd in the rally.
Prof Virendra and MLA Anand Singh Dangi also addressed the meeting.
He also handed over the list of about ten thousand workers who reached the rally from different villages.
Before the meeting, the MP inaugurated and laid the foundation stone of four road construction works in Maham, including the covered shed of the grain market, second watershed Maham, Government Multi-Technical Institute Building, the Gohana-Lakhan Majra-Maham-Bhiwani road.
Among others present on the occasion were district Congress president Jaideep Dhankar, Jagat Kala, Dharambir Vakil, Balram Dangi, Vikas Sisar, Shamsher Kharak, Anil Sharma, Sunil Rangi, Deepak Gupta, Dharamraj Sarpanch, Sadhu Baba and Nirmala Rathi.
Asaram, who is in jail for sexual harassment, was once again disappointed with the Supreme Court on Friday.
In the media coverage argued by Asaram, he is being produced as a children's blood-dracula, but the court rejected his demand to stay media coverage.
A bench of Chief Justice P Sathasivam refused to order restraining the media from running the news about Asaram, saying he had seen every word reported in the media and he does not see any reason to interfere in it.
How can we stop them when they are receiving information from the police and others?
Earlier, Asaram's lawyer accused the media of exaggerating reports about him.
There are so many newspapers and channels in the country.
Against whom they should file the case, but the bench was not impressed by these arguments and refused to interfere in the matter, saying they have more options.
Earlier, the court had rejected Asaram's demand to stay media coverage.
The study has been announced by the British government for the increase in Scotland's benefits from the HS2 rail project.
The actions by HS2 indicate high-speed services in Scotland and the northern part of England, which will soon begin with the first phase in 2026.
Transport Minister Barones Kramer reported that the project will "be united in the UK."
Scotland's Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very "excited" by working with the UK government on the project.
The first phase will include a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
Once the second stage is complete, the lines will reach Manchester and Leeds.
In June the government revised the cost of building high-speed links between London and northern England to £42.6 billion by £32.7 billion.
The British government, which was in talks with Scotland Transport, directed HS2 Ltd to consider the possibilities of further improving the rail capacity and travel time for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of reducing possible travel time from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London by three hours.
According to Barones Kramer: "Our goal for HS2 is the real national network, which will bring the UK and its cities closer."
We are moving forward with HS2, because its benefits will be much higher.
Without this, we will face problems related to the potential of our rail network.
But it's also about connectivity to 18 cities in the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be further connected because of the HS2.
According to Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichal: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown appealed to Mr. Carmichal for Scotland's "clear" withdrawal into the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown pointed out: "The high-speed rail is likely to make Scotland a huge economic gain, but it will also increase the economic burden on Scotland in the entire matter of high-speed rail across the UK.
We are therefore excited to work in the participation of the British Government, so that we can examine the options to bring high-speed rails to Scotland, create leverage for all, and to meet the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the investigation report with the British Government Ministers next year and taking a decision on further action together.
On behalf of the Shri Hindu Justice Peeth, on November 23, the national president of the anti-terrorist front, Maninderjit Singh Bitta, will recite Shri Hanuman Chalisa along with 10 thousand children in the recitation of Shri Hanuman Chalisa to be held at Dana Mandi near Jalandhar Bypass.
Bitta informed the Chief Spokespersons of Shri Hindu Justice Bench Praveen Dang and Ashwani Katyal, Bhupindra Banga, Surjit Jain, Bunty Bajaj, Raman Khosla, Bantu and Anil Sharma to the gathering after inviting them to the recitation of Hanuman Chalisa.
He appreciated the effort by the Sri Hindu Justice Bench to connect children with the Sanatan culture.
He said that for the unity and integrity of the country, it is also necessary to provide religious education to children including worldly education.
The Supreme Court refused to stop media reporting.
The Supreme Court said it cannot tell the media to report about the information received from the police or any other source.
Asaram's lawyer said that Asaram is being called a drawula in the case.
In this case, there is a guide line for reporting but it is not being followed.
The Supreme Court said that you have many more treatments that can be used.
Asaram's lawyer said that there are thousands of news papers and 100 news channels across the country, but there are especially two channels, due to which they are more troubled.
These people are damaging their image and reporting unilaterally.
In this case, Asaram's right should be protected.
The court refused to stop the media from reporting, but told Asaram's lawyer that he had other legal remedies he can use.
Black box in your car?
While the U.S. road planners are struggling with a shortage of funds to repair the collapsed highway system, many people are looking at the solution in a small black box, which fits the cleansing on your car's dashboard.
The device, which tracks every mile driven by a motor-driver and transmits that information to officials, has become an issue of a controversial attempt for Washington and the state planning office to renovate the old-fashed system to finance America's major roads nowadays.
Generally, a boring work like highway planning has also suddenly become an issue of intense debate and vibrant alliances.
The miles you've driven, and possibly keep details of the drive-driven space - and then use this information to create support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes - have been found with libertarian environmental groups to create support in favor of allowing the government to use these black boxes.
The tea party is swayed.
The U.S. Civil Freedoms Association is also very concerned, raising a variety of privacy issues.
While the Congress could not agree whether to take further action or not, many states are not waiting.
They're exploring how they can go into a system in the next decade, in which the driver pays for every mile fixed on the road.
Thousands of motorists have already taken a black box for test drives, some of which have GPS monitoring.
This is a really essential commodity for our country.
"It's not a matter of being chosen or not chosen by us," says Hassan Ikhrata, executive director of the South California Government Association, plans to start tracking every mile set by motorists in California by the year 2025.
The way we pay taxes is going to change.
Technology is to do this.
The main reason for this is that the country's highway trust fund has almost gone bankrupt, which is funded by the payment of taxes that U.S. citizens at a gas pump.
The American people don't buy as much gas as before.
Now the car in a gallon gas runs more miles than before.
Federal tax has not increased in the last 20 years, which is 18.4 cents per gallon.
Due to the high value of gas, politicians refrain from increasing taxes even a penny.
"Gas tax is not absolutely sustainable," says Lee Munich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
Their state has recently installed tracking devices in 500 cars to test the per-mile payment system.
"In the long term, it will serve as the most reasoned option," he says.
Wonks call it a mileage-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is looking good to urban liberals, because this, for example, can be changed in taxes to change the way car drives, which can help reduce jams and reduce greenhouse gas.
California's planners are keen on this system while they are developing strategies to meet the targets set in the state's ambitious global warming laws.
But the Chairman of the Home Transport Committee, Rip. Bill Schuster (A-PA) also considers the black box to be the most viable long-term option.
Independent sellers in the Region Foundation are also in favor of paying per mile by the driver.
Adrian Moore, vice president of the policy in Region, said, "It's not just doing what's going into the blind well."
People are paying more directly for what they are getting.
The campaign has also been supported by two former US transport secretaries who in their report in 2011 had graced Congress to move towards per-mile payments.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90-million trial project last year, which would have included 10,000 cars.
But while dealing with the concerns of rural lawmakers who were representing individuals who had to walk too many miles to go to work or go to the city every day, the House leadership abolished the resolution there.
However, many states and cities are moving in this direction.
The most interested in it is Auregon, which has listed 5,000 drivers in the country's largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of the gas tax to the state.
Nevada has already completed the preliminary test.
New York City is also moving in this direction.
Illinois is trying with trucks on a limited basis.
And the I-95 alliance, including the 17 State Department of Transportation (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida) along with the Eastern Seaboard, are studying how they can implement this change.
This idea was not supported everywhere.
In Nevada, where this device was installed on the cars of 50 voluntary car drivers, the drivers were very impatient thinking that the government could monitor each of their steps.
Alauddin Khan, who directed strategic and performance management in the Department of Transportation, says, "Anxiety about the Big Brother and other things of the same type was the major problem."
This is not something that people wanted.
As the test progressed, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be quite easy to convert these devices into a full tracking device."
There is no need to develop a large, unmanageable technology structure that has to be spread in a necessary way to keep a record of every person coming and going daily.
Nevada is one of the many states that are doing everything possible to achieve affordable technology, with the help of which the state can get a description of how many miles of the car is running every day, but not where and at what time it is running.
Khan said that if you can do this, people can feel more comfortable.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small California start-up called True Mileage.
This firm was not originally in the business of assisting the state tax drivers.
It was attempting to enter the emerging market of auto insurance, in which drivers had to pay on the basis of their mileage.
But the device it is testing was liked by the highway planners, because it does not use GPS and provides very limited information, which is uploaded by the modem at a fixed time interval.
"If you don't track people's speed and their location, they'll be more inclined to adopt this method," said Ryan Morrison, chief executive of True Mileage.
Some major mistakes have been made in these initial programmes of the state.
There are also very low costly and less interfering methods to do so.
In Oregon, planners are using giving drivers different options.
They can choose the device of GPS or without GPS.
Or choose not to take any device again, but rather choose to pay the prescribed fee based on the average miles to be decided by the residents of the state.
Other places hope that this retention can be sold to worried citizens by providing more convenience rather than less in the device.
In New York City, transport officials are attempting to develop a taxing device that will also facilitate paying parking meter fees, providing "paying according to your drive" insurance, and will create a collection of real-time speed data from other drivers that motorists will be able to use to avoid traffic.
"Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation because of the benefits it receives," the city planning document mentions, "Motor-drivers will be attracted to participation in it."
However, some transport planners wonder if perhaps all the discussion on payments according to the miles is big distraction.
The Metropolitan Transport Commission in the San Francisco Bay Area has said that Congress can deal with the problem of bankrupt highway trust funds very easily by increasing the gas tax.
Drivers of hybrids or other cars can also be charged for an additional one-time or annual fee, whose vehicles do not use too much gas so that they pay their fair share.
"When aspirin can work, what is the need for radical surgery," said Randy Rentcheller, director of legislation and public affairs of the commission.
If we do this, crores of car drivers will be worried about their privacy and many other things.
SRINAGAR: The security of former minister Ghulam Hasan Khan, who joined the Congress from the Peoples Democratic Party, has been allegedly removed by the police.
Khan blamed the state government for this, saying his security has been removed due to political reasons.
Ghulam Hasan Khan, who won the 2002 election from Shopian on a PDP ticket from Shopian, was in his cabinet cabinet when he was the chief minister.
Ghulam Hasan Khan said, "I have been under the protection cover since 1996.
I live in Shopian, which is called the stronghold of terrorists.
A CRPF security starc was deployed at my house under the leadership of a sub-inspector.
I also have a bodyguard, but on Thursday, all my security was suddenly withdrawn.
When the security squad was leaving my house, I spoke to the District Deputy Commissioner and the District SP.
But instead of restoring security, he only said that he would investigate the matter.
However, when contacted, Kashmir IGP Abdul Ghani Mir denied the information about the matter, saying it was a sensitive matter.
I will myself examine how the security of a former minister and senior political leader has been removed.
State Congress chief Prof Saifuddin Soz said, "There is nothing like this in my knowledge.
If the security of Hasan Khan has been compromised, it is a very serious matter.
I am currently in Jammu and Kashmir in the next two days.
I will discuss the issue with the concerned administration.
Land Rover Rray Series Announced

CDC issues allergy guidelines for children for schools
On Wednesday, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to control food allergies of children in the school.
For the first time, such guidelines have been issued by the U.S. government, as the number of children going to school suffer from food allergies is increasing.
Now one in every 20 children in the U.S. have food allergies.
The CDC found that between 1997 and 2007, there has been an increase of 18 per cent in food allergy cases in children.
The guidelines have been informed to the schools how to inform the teachers and staff about the food allergies of the children, and how to handle it in case of an allergic reaction.
Schools have also been suggested to keep the stock of appinephrine to withstand potentially life-threatening anaphylaxis - which is the auto-injector of the epipen brand that is most commonly used.
The state assembly has recently updated the rules, allowing schools to easily keep stock of APnephrine in large quantities.
The report also includes a list of common symptoms transmitted by children with allergic reaction.
Children can say "It seems that something is pricking in my tongue," "It looks like I have hair on my tongue", or "I'm having tingling in my tongue."
Aircraft electrical equipment rules will be effective in Australia
Despite the softening of equipment-related regulations in the US, Australian aircraft passengers will continue to switch off their tablets and smart phones while off flying and landing aircraft.
The US Federal Aviation Administration has left U.S. aircraft service companies open the option to change their processes, so that during the important stages of the flight, passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their equipment, provided those devices remain in "Air" mode.
Passengers can do this during a lot of flights right now, but many people do not like to be unable to fly and access their e-book etc. while landing the aircraft.
Australian aircraft service companies are considering this decision, according to which US aircraft service companies will have to do a lot of work to meet this requirement, but they have indicated that they have no immediate plans to make changes to their processes.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electrical equipment are still effective at critical flight in Australia.
"Currently, CASA has no specific regulation governing the use of electrical equipment in the aircraft," the authority said, adding that the issue comes under regulations, according to which the airline operations companies have to ensure that the security system is always fully maintained, and the passengers have to comply with the safety instructions given by the crew members."
Virgin who is already in talks with CASA about expanding the use of her in-flight Wi-Fi entertainment system is ready to follow this change, but she asked for further action on the regulator's instructions.
"We will welcome the review by CASA in case of allowing the use of electrical equipment, because we really feel like it will provide a better experience to customers, because we now have (wireless in-flight entertainment) in our aircraft.
Quantas said it will follow the current rules.
"In accordance with our current policy, electrical equipment cannot be used while flying and landing the aircraft, and we have no immediate plans to change it," it said.
FAA decisions apply to U.S. Allerlines.
We are always interested in regulatory developments that can benefit travellers and we will certainly consider the decisions of the FAA and the reasons behind it.
The impact of this decision will vary on each US aircraft service company and will depend on the age of their aircraft.
Airplannes will need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices, as well as amend their rule books, training materials, carry-on baggage programmes and brief descriptions to passengers.
"After verifying the tolerance of their aircraft by the airlines, it will allow passengers to use hand-held, light-weight electrical appliances such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones at all heights," the FAA said.
In sparse cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off their equipment while landing.
The group has also suggested to keep heavy equipment safely under the seat or keep it in the upper compartments while flying and landing.
He was received by 42 senior leaders of the state BJP at the airport.
Modi is on a visit to Bihar for the consolation yatra organised by the BJP.
The consolation yatra is an exercise by the BJP to heal the families of those killed in the blasts in Patna.
On October 27, during Narendra Modi's Hunkar rally in Patna, a total of seven blasts were reported one after the other.
The Indian Mujahideen terrorists, who were involved in the blasts, were intended to create a stampede during the rally so that more and more people were injured and an atmosphere of panic prevails in the state.
The intention of the terrorists did not succeed, but six people lost their lives in the blasts.
All of them have been declared martyred by the BJP.
The party leaders have left the village on Thursday.
On November 5th, all the ashes of all of them will be flown together in the Ganga in Patna.
Consolation Yatra is a part of this journey.
The main character is Narendra Modi.
They will visit the village of those killed in the blasts from Saturday morning and meet their families.
During this meeting, he will also provide a cheque of five rupees each to the families of the deceased.
The BJP has already announced this financial assistance.
The accused used to open the accounts of investors citing the trading firm and forged in the name of buying and selling shares.
Perhaps for the first time in the state, such revelations have come to light that have come to light of crores of rupees.
The police have not been able to reach the spot yet, but seven people, including the accused, who saw his work in the state, have been detained by the police.
The gang used to operate a fake commodity market in the name of MetaTrader-5.
The company's doers used to take cash from investors and give fake IDs on a fake software.
On trading, the stocks purchased by the investors were visible to the accused.
It was even known at what price the share was bought.
In fact, no shares were bought or there was any transaction for this, because no demat account of investors was opened and shares were shown to be false on this fake software.
The police suspect that hundreds of people have come to the fore in this gang.
In the name of giving profit from each investor, two to five lakh rupees were invested.
The main accused, Amit Soni, has been detained by the cyber cell from Jodhpur, while his six other accomplices have been arrested from Indore.
According to ADG Cyber Cell Ashok Dohe, any stock trading company is required to join the stock exchange as a trading firm.
Only after this, the company can get the shares trading done to the investors through it.
Then the investor's demat account is opened so that shares can be bought and sold for it, but this company named MetaTrader 5 was neither associated with any exchange nor used to get stock trading done.
The company bought a server for itself on September 24, 2012, citing trading in the name of WinTrade.
Since then, people have been bluffed in the name of investment through this company.
Eight Indore-based traders, who have complained to the cyber cell, have come to the fore.
Even after selling his purchased shares for profit, his money was not transferred to the account.
On this, he started asking for the profit amount from the company's actors.
Investors are even saying that the price of their purchased shares was always shown to be lower on the fake ID given to them.
The accused used to decide this price at their level.
The company has appointed its CEO and agents in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.
The agents used to advise people to join this company by luring them with more profits.
After this, two lakh rupees were deposited from someone and up to five lakh rupees were deposited from someone.
Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly admitted that in some cases the US spy has crossed the limit.
He also claimed that innocent people have not been tortured under the Intelligence Surveillance Programme.
Kerry's confession came to light while addressing the annual summit of the Open Government Partnership held in London through video link.
I assure you that innocent people are not being tortured in this process.
But in some cases, inappropriate methods have been adopted in an attempt to get information.
Meanwhile, a key US Congressional committee has approved a bill limiting the surveillance activities of the National Security Agency (NSA).
The aim is to make surveillance more transparent and restore the confidence among the people who have been hurt by the massively taped phones.
The Senate move has been welcomed by six US companies, including Google, Yahoo.
The NSA has also breached the data centres of these companies.
The Senate Select Committee on Friday passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Reforms Bill (FISA), which was clipped on the NSA by four votes against 11 votes.
The bill mentions a number of restrictions, including prohibiting one-time phone tapping under the US Patriot Act.
Under the FISA, the use of data will be deliberately unauthorisedly collected and its use will be treated as an offence and a provision has been made for ten years in jail.
The bill will become a law after the Congress passes both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
The committee's chairman and Senator Diane Festin said the programme for recording the NSA's phone is under the law and I believe it has contributed significantly to the country's security.
But more transparency should be brought in.
Not only this, the safety of the privacy of the public should also be taken care of.
Meanwhile, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, AOL and Facebook have supported the bill after the NSA's internet surveillance program was revealed.
In a letter to senators, the companies said, "We welcome this proposal of lawmakers who curb the large-scale phone record of the NSA.
It is worth mentioning that the documents issued by former CIA employee Edward Snowden removed the veil from the deeds of the NSA.
The NSA has been in a state of a lot of resentment among the international community after the NSA revealed the telephonic conversations of 35 countries, including Germany and France.
In the unintended confession, John Kerry said that the U.S. spying "inappropriately has gone too far"
John Kerry has indicated the softening of the U.S.'s protective attitude on his surveillance program by admitting that sometimes its spying "inappropriately goes far ahead."
The Minister of State has also acknowledged that he is also guilty of being on a "automatic pilot" as a "automatic pilot" towards informant Edward Snowden about the espionage activities of the NSA coming to the fore.
This revelation has brought a diplomatic storm to the U.S. government in relation to its allies.
Speaking through the video link at the Open Government Conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: "There is no question that the President, me, and others in the government, were really aware of some of the things that happened to the automatic pilot, because back to see, the difficult years of the Second and the Cold War, and then, of course, had its potential in 9/11.
They have become the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government, who have admitted that U.S. spying has crossed its limits, but stressed that no one's rights have been misused.
He said: "In some cases, it has gone too far inappropriately."
And the President is determined to try to make this clear to the people and is still conducting a thorough review so that no person has a sense of abuse.
I assure you that nothing is wrong with innocent people in the process.
Mr. Kerry emphasized that however, the NSA was striving for a good cause, and its surveillance work has saved many lives.
He further explained: "We are facing a world where people are ready to blow up themselves."
There is radical extremism in the world, which is committed to blewing people to kill them and attack governments.
So what's the problem if you're able to stop it before it happens?
We have saved the plane from actually falling, buildings collapse, and killing people because we have been able to know in advance about the plan of others.
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee for European Affairs on Thursday said that the U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to assist in resolving concerns abroad about the so-called U.S. espionage, and try to convince European countries about the need to continue with anti-corruption efforts jointly with the U.S.
Conequet Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about threats of his involvement in counter-terrorism groups due to the frustration of surveillance by the National Security Agency.
"It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that European countries are with us in the context of our counter-terrorism efforts," Murphy, president of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee for the Democratic Party, told Washington in an interview.
European countries need to continue working together to make it clear to fight terrorism, which should not be influenced by their anger about the NSA program.
Reports of the NSA recording millions of phone conversations in Europe have brought bitterness to relations with some of the U.S. allies, although the head of the agency said that these reports were not entirely correct, and shows the misunderstanding of the metadata shared by NATO allies with the United Nations.
Other disclosures in the documents leaked by Snowden show that the NSA has monitored the cellphones of 34 other world leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended the spying on allies, calling it necessary and said it was common to do so by both sides.
Amid the uproar, Murphy said his office was arranging a Congress yatra which is likely to be held this year, and expressed hope that the delegation would include members of both parties and the chambers.
Names of other legal manufacturers participating will be released in the coming days.
He said that work is still being done on the iteer schedule.
While Murphy said that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations, he said that some "imprograble relationships" will also have to be sacrificed.
He said European leaders would also have to be honest with their people, with their spying programs used for years.
"However, we can modify our surveillance program to better protect the rights of the Europeans, but they also need to agree that we are not the only ones who are spying," Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Carey is scheduled to visit the Middle East and Poland this weekend, where he will address hatred of the U.S. strategy to U.S. surveillance activities in Syria, Egypt and Iran.
NSA accuses "internal error" instead of hackers to crash the website
The mystical national security agency said on Friday that our website was closed for a few hours due to some technical shortages, not because of hackers as some people claimed online.
"NSA.gov tonight was not in access for several hours, caused by an internal error that occurred during the pre-determined update," the intelligence agency said in an emailed statement.
This problem will be solved this evening.
The claim is not true that this hurdle, the delivery denial of service [DDOS] came due to the attack.
In the evening, online server trackers found that the NSE's website was closed for at least six hours, and for some users the site is still not accessible.
The NSA spokesperson told ABC News that the agency's internal, sensitive network had not been "absolutely" compromised.
No classified information is under threat, the spokesperson said.
At least one hacktoist group has claimed online that they are responsible for disrupting the NSA website by the DDOS attack.
The DDOS attack is designed in such a way that traffic is sent to the target website in such a large amount of traffic, until the site is closed due to the server overload.
This cyber strategy is relatively unrefined and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former highly mysterious NSA, which was once named "no agency", has led to the occurrence of a large amount of foreign and domestic espionage programs in the past months, creating a topic of discussion and bitter criticism among the general public – the secret of the secret NSA files by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, who was massacred.
Due to such a growing controversy about the agency, there was speculation after the incident of tonight that, the incident was the result of the targeted cyber operation.
A firefighting party was called to save a lost puppy at the mouth of a distressed mountain 50 feet above the ground in a mine
Cocker spannely Ruby had fled after hitting a small road
He was spotted three days later by a dog walker trapped in the mine
Firefighters put the front part of the rock down with a rope to protect the dog from the mouth of death
After the puppy somehow got stuck on the mouth of a distressed mountain 50 feet above the ground, calling firefighting personnel gave him a lucky life.
The nine-month-old cocker spannell Ruby, who fled after a road collision on Sunday afternoon, spent 3 days alone before being rescued from the mine on Wednesday.
His owner Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, was in the Flappit mine in Pashmichi Yorker for re-meeting with Denhome, Ruby, and has thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
After a small accident, he searched for his lost dog as crazy, and posted an appeal on social networking sites.
At 2.15 pm on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed dock walker saw Ruby, on the mountain in the mine at an altitude of 50 feet from the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Kleckahheaton fire station reached the spot and lowered it down by rope to save Ruby and used a belly tube to bring it down from the rock.
Expert technical rescue officer Andy Clayton said: She was in a critical situation.
She was in the middle of the front part of the rock, 50 feet from above and below.
She did not commit a single act during the rescue, she remained stone.
But now it is good.
After that, she was eating biscuits.
It was a call for an absolutely unusual help.
It is unbelievable to see a dog.
Special Technical Rescue Officer Peter Law said: "Ruby has survived a fortunate way."
He was likely to be seriously injured or in a worse condition.
Ruby was taken to a veterinarian for examination, where he was found to be good in addition to exhaustion and dehydration.
Miss Hall from Halefax, West Yorkshire, said: "It was terrible to see the rescue work"
At first, I couldn't believe how she got there.
It is amazing to get him back in his hands.
The veterinarian said that if she was very tired and fell, she would definitely have fallen down.
The firefighting team did a great job.
What they did is a really courageous task.
We are grateful to him, and they were all excellent.
Mr. Alderson from Kigley also said: "We were afraid that she might fall, but she stayed there."
The firefighting team did a great job.
I can't believe how she got there.
This caused inconvenience to the players.
On the occasion, Bar Association president Ramesh Singh Negi expressed his anger over the deteriorating law and order situation in the state.
He said that the rapid increase in attacks on lawyers and their families proves that the culprits have become fearless.
There is no fear of police and administrative system on them.
Referring to such incidents at different places recently, he said that when the advocate society is not safe, the safety of the common man can be easily estimated.
Frontier Airlines Carry - On Baggage to Charge
Frontier Airlines plans to charge $100 to carry luggage for passengers on their board on board.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging for $100 for a carry - on bag and will charge $2 for coffee or soda, although its announcement on Wednesday reported that passengers can keep the entire box.
The new carry - on-charge is for the bag in the overhead bin, therefore, the small bag under the seat will still be free.
Frontier said $25 would charge if paid in advance, $100 will have to wait if passengers wait to pay as long as they are at the gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is to take care of the charges in advance of passengers.
"We don't want to charge that," he said.
The airlines started charging for the first and second check-up bags in 2008.
Passengers who are filling those who are trying to avoid fees are filling as they can carry - in the overhead compartment in which the overhead compartment is stashed, it means this compartment often has less space.
The fee is a way to bring less for passengers on board.
O'Maley said it wasn't really about raising new charges money.
It has become increasingly difficult to find the most loyal customers about Frontier that replacing the overhead bin.
Passengers who buy tickets on their website of the airline do not have to pay this.
That means that the next person in the line can have to pay $100 for a similar bag, while a passenger in the line at a frontier gate can get a bag free.
O'Mally said that the Frontier's website and the procedures of the check-in are being changed to ensure that passengers know about the fees before getting the gate.
The frontier's new carry - on fees, will not start until summer, although a date has not been set.
Passengers often express dissatisfaction about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines prefer them.
They argue that the baggage costs money to handle, and those who want the passenger service should pay for it.
Baggage fees on Wall Street are charging enough money to cover the cost of air after years of many airline losses.
Most although Carrie - on bag fees are not even touched.
Spirit Airlines Inc. started Carrie - On Charge for the first time three years ago, and fellow Discounter Allegiant Air later.
One such fee is the Wizz Air of other airline Hungari, which said airline consultant J Sorensen, and which tracks the add-on fees.
He said Spirit's carry - on fee brings $50 million in a year which was estimated in a December 2011 report.
Sorensen, a former official of Midwest Airlines recently flew into Spirit and passengers have faced carry-on unusual bag fees at the gate.
"The boarding process that I saw in my airline career was comfortable," he said.
I was expected to grind teeth and look out at a battle gate.
"The plane was full and he said it was lickety-split."
Frontier is also following Spirit's $2 fee for coffee, tea, soda, or juice.
The frontier said that the passenger who will take soda, or juice, can keep the whole box, and it will give free coffee only for once.
It will still remove the water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for beverages in 2008, but seven months after passengers complained they retreated and followed after any other main airline was there.
This step of the Frontier to charge the fee on Carrier's is its latest attempt to operate customers per their own website if the passengers of Frontier's not purchase directly from the airline.
Airlines online travel seller pays Orbitz such a $10 to $25 for each sold ticket.
That is why all airlines have been given an incentive to operate passengers to buy directly from those instead of going through an online travel agency.
The Frontier, however, has moved on to the region.
In September many often began to give from halfway flight miles for customers who bought from these individuals from an online travel agency
On Wednesday, it reduced the Mileage Award to 25 percent of the trip meal.
So, a 1000-mile frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency will earn 250 miles.
It also allows the sole travelers to choose their seat in advance when buying directly from the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal base of customers in the city of its home in Denver, but its business is decreasing and it is losing money.
Revenue decline by 9 percent and its flight capacity has decreased by about 13 percent in the first quarter, according to financial results released by Corporate Parent Republic Airways Holdings Inc. on Wednesday.
Republic Airlines are trying to decide the finances of the Frontier as part of the sales.
There will be a "renovation" of the Chinese newspaper arguing
A Chinese newspaper that made an appeal on the homepage to release a reporter guilty of defamation would be renovated, a press regulator said.
The New Express, a Guiangzhou newspaper, had made a rare public argument for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But after that Mr. Chen admitted on television that he had taken a bribe to write fabricated news about the state's partially owned company.
The regulator said that now New Express has to go through a "complete reform."
The "reform" was ordered from the Gwangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television administration.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express of Yangcheng Evening News Group had published a lot of false news stories about the listed company Zoomlion in the period between September 2012 and August 2013.
The regulator said in a statement that "the editorial management of New Express was unorganized."
It said it had decided to "impose an administrative punishment by cancelling the reporter's license of Chen Yongzhou."
It had "directed the Yangcheng Evening News Group to make a complete improvement of the New Express, New Express recommended an investigation into the people responsible for it and immediately revise the New Express leadership team."
Mr. Chen wrote many articles in New Express, which blamed financial irregularities in a construction-equiption company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two front pages of appeals for his release, and said that he supported Mr. Chen's journalism.
But after that Mr. Chen came to state television and accepted to write and publish false stories for money.
"In this case, I have harmed the entire news industry and its ability to win the trust of the people," he told C.C.T.V., state broadcaster C.C.T.V., that of the people.
I did this mainly because I was greedy for money and fame.
I have realised my mistakes.
After Mr. Chen's apologizing, New Express issued a front page apology, stating that it had failed to properly examine his report.
Recently, many high-profile suspects have reconced the TV-disported fault.

The players of this team keep setting new records in the day in Tests and now their status in ODIs is gradually increasing.
There was also a great example of this on Thursday when a good New Zealand team was defeated by Bangladesh in the ODI series to win the title by taking an unstoppable lead.
Sohag Ghazi and Masharfemurtaza helped Bangladesh beat New Zealand by 40 runs in the second ODI to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
This is Bangladesh's sixth consecutive victory in ODIs against New Zealand.
Earlier, New Zealand had lost the series 0-4 in the 2010 tour of Bangladesh.
Chasing Bangladesh's target of 248, New Zealand lost wickets at regular intervals in front of Ghazi's spin (34/3) and the stormy bowling of Murtaza (43/3), leaving the team for 207 in 46.4 overs.
Ross Taylor top-scored for New Zealand with 45 while Corey Anderson scored 37.
Kyle Mills did not get 27 not out, while Nathan McCullum contributed 25 runs, but no batsman of the team could turn a good start into a big innings, which led to the team's defeat.
Earlier, Bangladesh were bowled out for 247 in 49 overs despite a half-century by Tamim Iqbal (58).
Anderson and James Neesham took eight wickets.
Anderson took four for 40, while Neesham took four for 53 runs.
Tamim has become the highest run-scorer for Bangladesh.
Tamim, who surpassed Shakib Al Hasan, has scored 3702 runs in 124 matches.

The police have recovered fake registry, fake seals, laptops and photographs of fake registry from the possession of the accused.
The police has registered a case against all the accused.
Police Commissioner Paramjit Singh Gill said the accused have been identified as Rajiv Agarwal alias Binttu of Chandra Nagar in Haibowal, Kamal Krishan Jaswal of Ghumar Mandi, Gurinder Singh Gagi of Kohara and Sonu of Ghumar Mandi.
Balbir Singh, registrar's office (East), fled from the spot.
According to the police, the accused along with the clerk of the registrar's office and recordkeeper Balbir Singh used to extract the papers from the records of vacant and old lands and after that they used to buy new stamp papers and prepare a fake registry on them.
After that, the original registry was missing and put it on the forged registry record.
After this, the accused used to sell the land on forged papers for crores of rupees.
At the same time, they used to take loans on these fake papers.
After this, the real owner of the land was left with the police and the administration.
The accused, who had prepared the forged registry, kept a special eye on the lands of the NRIG.
Because there is no one to look after the land of NRIG.
Therefore, it is easy to sell the forged registry of those lands.
Police Commissioner Gill said that during interrogation, the accused told that they have prepared about 150 fake registries so far.
According to the police, a case of theft and fraud has been registered against Rajiv, the mastermind of the gang.
Children should be taught "as model for a way of the author of life", myths and legends.
Thor's stories could show"There is no match of all subtle moves in the cruel force, "while the Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths also taught "expressive far away even wild and in some cases it would not be appropriate to be taught obscene and even in schools," Cross Lee Holland advocated one of the appropriate tasks of age.
"I find it amazing, in America, myth and folklore is already a part of the field of education," he said.
I am championing this as a plan for twenty years.
He has called the authors and teachers "more enlightening" and this is "a new twist" for children, along with the messages being "presented" in entertaining stories.

BJP's prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi, who arrived in Pune to inaugurate a part of the Dinanath Mangeshkar Hospital, on Friday launched a scathing attack on the Congress while addressing an election rally.
"""Sometimes a coalition government was formed at many states and at the Centre, sometimes in the Congress, sometimes the government of the Communists, sometimes the BJP government was formed."
You have seen the rule of many parties.
I call upon the political pundits and economists of the country.
Some parameters should be fixed in the country.
What did the team do?
If there is a comparative result, then the question of whether the BJP should come to power or not.
Whenever the BJP government has been formed, efforts have been made to fulfill the aspirations of the people.
This country is witness to the country's inflation in the government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and Morarji Desai.
The poor man used to get food for two times.
But when the Congress or the support government was formed, the poor man did not get enough food.
Not a single Congress leader, a single UPA leader is responding to what he did in nine-and-a-half years.
Even the media in our country is not able to reach them.
The Congress has become arrogant.
They do not respond to the media.
The Lok Sabha elections are in the Lok Sabha, you should answer to the people.
Attacking Congress leader Kapil Sibal, Modi said, "Today, questions are being asked to Modi. In 2014, when the people will bless the BJP, then every year they will present their work in front of the people.
In a democracy, the servant should sit in Delhi, not a ruler.
There can be no Nath in Delhi, there should be only slaves.
Congress friends leave balloons every day.
Congress friends, we have already taken the exam 10 months ago.
In a democracy, people take the test.

Due to this, the number of cases of violation of the code of conduct has started decreasing now.
Since the implementation of the model code of conduct on October 4, 313 cases were registered against various political parties till October 21.
From October 22 to 27, only 31 cases have been registered.
With the implementation of the model code of conduct, cases of violation of it were also coming.
In the initial days, there were more complaints, but it has started decreasing gradually.
It is being told that in the initial days, due to lack of complete information about the code of conduct, more complaints were being received against political parties.
Due to the Election Commission making political parties aware and taking lessons from the registered case, now fewer complaints are coming.
Many parties were campaigning as usual in the absence of information, but when action was taken against them, they stopped it.
Political parties are following this along with getting information about the election code of conduct.
This is also reducing the number of cases of violation.

Asaram, who is currently in judicial custody in the Central Jail on charges of sexually assaulting a minor girl, will be celebrated in Diwali jail.
Apart from Jodhpur, Asaram is also an accused in the rape case of a Surat-based girl.
His son Narayan Sai has been absconding from the police.

One of them is also in New Jersey, USA.
Asaram and his son have been accused of atrocities.
Even on this, the blind faith of many of his devotees is not ending.
Asaram dominates not only in India but also in the US.
Even though Asaram is in jail in India and devotees are getting away from him, but not at all in America.
In the Ashram in New Jersey, devotees are still visiting Asaram as before.
Scientists have further highlighted the link between the dog's tail movements and its mood.
Previous research has shown that happy dogs move their tail more to the right (from the point of view of a dog), while restless dogs move their tails more mainly on the left.
But now scientists say that fellow dogs can recognize this subtle distinction of the tail and express their reaction to it.
The study was published in the journal Cortont Biology.
Georgia Vellertigara, neuroscientist professor from the University of Trento, explained: "In humans all know very well that the left and right parts of the brain are involved in the stimulation that generates positive or negative emotions."
Here we have tried to see it in other species as well.
He pointed out that the right part of the brain in dogs, like humans, was responsible for the left-handed movements and the opposite order, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to single-sided squirrel shaking by other dogs, researchers tracked down animals watching movies from other dogs.
He measured the heartbeats of pet dogs and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won't take long for us to understand why their tail sometimes moves to one side, sometimes on the other.
Prof. Vellartigara pointed out: "We introduced dogs with dog films – in the shadow-picture to deal with realistic version or other tangled issues, and we could see the tail movement and present the tail more left or right."
When the animals saw an emotional dog moving their tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog), they were completely relaxed.
But when they saw the tail changing direction mainly to turn to the left (from the point of view of the dog), their heartbeat increased and they looked restless.
According to Prof. Vellartigara, he does not think that the dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Instead, they think dogs have learned from their experience about what act they should be worried about and what not.
He said: "If you have met other dogs many times, and if they constantly move their tails to one side it is more friendly behavior, and the right part presents less friendly behavior, you react based on the same experience."
The researchers say these findings can provide better information to owners, veterinarians and trainers about animal sentiments.
John Bradshaw, a guest fellow at the University of Bristol's School of Veternerary Sciences, a dog behavior expert, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left or right part is important for dogs.
Last year's team from the University of Lincoln found that when dogs look at an aggressive dog, turn their heads to the left and turn their heads to the right when they see a happy dog.
In other research from the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: "In contrast to the Italian study - when the robot dog's tail was shaken to the left way than right, the dogs were more likely to get closer than to be restless."
He said this difference was because in various studies, dogs in films were not fully considered dogs to be completely swhew.
He clarified that this could help the study of how dogs react to real dogs.
"While there has been considerable evidence from different mammals that two parts of the brain are used for different purposes, more detailed information is still left to be obtained - and dogs are not an exception in this case," he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, it seems that it will probably not take much time to understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side, sometimes on the other.
New research has shown that we work with complete honesty and dedication in the morning.
Don't lie to anyone and don't think of stealing or cheating.
But in the evening, our mind changes and we keep the ideal aside and start running against the rule.
In this research from Harvard University and the David Eclus School of Business of Uto, researchers have given many interesting facts.
According to the researchers, without the stress of work in the morning, we prefer moral values, but honesty decreases due to fatigue or excessive pressure as soon as the evening comes.
For this, the researchers conducted two experiments.
He asked some people to tell the number of points on the computer screen.
For example, people had to tell whether the point was more on the left side or on the right.
The participants were told that if they give wrong answers instead of the right answer, they will be given money.
In this experiment, it was seen that the people who were used between 8 and 12 in the morning did not make any mistake and gave the correct answer.
While experimenting on people between 12 noon and 6 pm, it was found that he deliberately gave wrong answers by keeping his principles on hold.
This made the researchers able to prove that the greed for money in the morning does not make any difference to our honesty, but in the evening, we stop paying attention to morality.
The study was published in the latest psychological science issue.

The condition of the building has become so bad that the employees are afraid to even sit in it.
The condition of the building is so bad that often the plaster falls from the roofs.
In the last one month, cement has fallen from the roofs of four rooms.
A woman employee was also injured in the incident.
JE and Revenue Accountants were injured in the incident.
At present, about four and a half hundred employees work in the building.
These include 5 XENs, 12 SDOs, 20 Junior Engineers, 150 Cellacle Staff, 200 Technical Staff and 20 other staff members.
The situation is that nothing has been done by the Powercom authorities so far about their safety.
Three rooms, scooters and bicycle stands, two rooms in the upper floor have completely collapsed.
In such a situation, the condition of the building can be easily estimated.
Callson used phone hacking to confirm secret information
Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World, has been accused of using "phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-face" in an attempt to confirm a so-called secret information about his love affair when Charles Clark was the home secretary.
Prosecutor Andrew Eddes Q.C. told Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumour in May 2005 that Clarke was retalusing his "attractive special adviser" Hannah Paulby.
The court said the newspaper hired private investigator Glenn Mulkerer to hack Paulby's voicemail and "keeping an eye", but Callson also called and abandoned his voicemail.
Mr. Eddes said that the prosecution side suggests that Mr. Colson, who is currently the editor of N.O.T.W., is not known to stand outside the house of the people and keep an eye on them, but he keeps articles in front of people, see how people react to it."
He said that NOTW used three methods to investigate the cases: phone hacking, surveillance and face-to-faith.
The third one included the editor himself.
It is clear that he knew about the other way, that is, the monitor, he knew.
What about the first?
Did he know about the phone hacking?
He says, no, we have to say, "Yes, he knew it."
The rumor about Clark's pleasing was first introduced by A.O.T.W.'s feature desk when a source sexually inclined at Ms. Paulby said: "Don't waste your time, he's with Charles."
From home from Mulkereyre in August 2006, the tape of voicemail was seized at least three times from Ms. Paulby's phone.
Investigators also found entries in the personal investigator's computer that named "Project" to Ms. Paulby and her sister.
At the time of his investigation, Ms. Paulby's grandparents were asked for information about them by making anonymous calls.
Former chief reporter Nevili Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup looked at the surveillance of Ms. Paulby.
On June 18, 2005, he was called a voicemail by Callson: "I've got a story that we plan to run tomorrow, about which I would definitely like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Eddes said that the involvement of Colson in this case is only in the court of other important individuals, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The bench heard on Thursday that Colson had a conversation with Mr. Blunket about his love affair with a married woman, while at that time he was looking after the case of co-respondent Rebekha Brooks, who was then married.
Callson and Brooks refused to misbehave with others for hacking phones between October 3, 200 and 9, 2006.
Mulcare, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have accepted the phone hacking.
Buoyed by the massive win in the last match, India will aim to capture the series with a win when they enter the seventh and final ODI against Australia at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium on Saturday.
India had to win the Nagpur ODI in any case to remain in the series after two consecutive ODIs were washed out due to rain and their batsmen performed a bang to give them a record victory, making the team 2-2 level in the series.
India have achieved the target of more than 350 runs twice in the series and once again the responsibility of the team's victory will be on the batsmen.
Indian batting is at its peak and the biggest goal is also proving to be a dwarf in front of them.
Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli and Mahendra Singh Dhoni are in tremendous form, but Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina and Ravindra Jadeja will also have a lot of expectations from the team.
As far as opening is concerned, the team has got such an opening pair in the form of Rohit and Shikhar, which is making the rest of the batsmen easier with a solid partnership.
In Jaipur and Nagpur, he had given Virat a chance to play without any pressure while making a great partnership in the opening.
Kohli's impressive performance so far is considered to be the Sachin Tendulkar of the future.
Many cricket pundits have labelled him better than Sachin.
Virat Kohli, who is set to become 25 years next week, has scored 17 ODI centuries, out of which India have won 16.
While chasing the target, his average is above 80.00 and has emerged as the best finisher.
India's top three batsmen are in strong form, but excessive dependence on these three can also be harmful to the team.
Raina and Yuvraj had flopped badly in the last match.
Yuvraj has not even opened an account in two matches in the series.
In such a situation, a good innings in Bangalore ODI can work as a 'lifeline' for them.
As far as Australia is concerned, his batsmen, especially captain George Bailey, have impressed everyone with his performance.
He is also seeking to take him in the Test squad for the home Ashes series against England.
Australia have good batsmen up to the ninth position.
Apart from Bailey, Shane Watson, Glenn Maxwell, Adam Woges and James Faulkner have batted well in the series.
However, Phil Hunge and Aaron Finch have not been able to make any impact in the opening.
Mitchell Johnson's lack of bowling could be overwhelming for Australia.
Johnson, who has performed brilliantly so far in the series, has been sent back to India to prepare for the Ashes series.
The dream of firecracker traders to do business in the firecracker market in the transport area did not come true.
The firecracker traders have been caught in the muddar after the High Court order.
Neither can they now do business in the temporary firecracker market built at Ranjit Avenue, nor have they been issued licenses for business in the transport area.
The commission, constituted by the Punjab and Haryana High Court, during its visit, declared the temporary firecracker market at Ranjit Avenue as unsafe.
The Deputy Commissioner of Amritsar was also fined Rs ten lakh due to lack of proper arrangements.
In its order, the High Court has slammed the administrative officials of Amritsar, saying that the administration has not been able to solve any problem of firecracker traders for nine years.
They could not be provided proper space in the city.
After this, proper security arrangements were made and the firecracker traders were asked to issue licenses for business in the market itself in Shipgarh itself.
After this order, even though the firecracker traders were happy, the police turned away on their happiness on Friday.
The police team reached the firecracker market and sold the form by putting a counter there.
It was impossible to fulfill the conditions that were stated to him in a day.
ACP East Gaurav Garg, Aslaha License Branch in-charge Anup Kumar, SHO Sultanwind Arun Sharma reached the spot.
He expressed dissatisfaction over the arrangements made by the firecracker traders.
Therefore, licenses were not issued to firecracker traders.
Diwali is left for a day.
Due to this, the traders are worried.
They are losing crores of rupees.
Avinash Singh, Rakesh Seth, Harish Dhawan, Harish Dua, Desraj, Satnam Singh, Manjinder Singh and Ginni said they would stake claim to the district administration if they lose crores of rupees.
Angry firecracker traders took out a protest march from Shipgarh to Ranjit Avenue on Friday night.
They raised slogans against the district administration and the police.
After this, the business was also closed in the temporary firecracker market running in Ranjit Avenue.
Head constable Om Prakash retired after serving for 32 years in the police department in Ghumarwin.

It is true that our work cannot be done without money.
Money is one of the greatest needs for living, but it is not in our interest to accept it all.
We celebrate Dhanteras on Krishna Trayodashi in the month of Kartik.
Dhanteras is worshiped by Kuber, the god of wealth, and Yamraj, the death god.
Money has an important place in our religion and life.
No money is good.
Our feeling of money is good and bad.
There can be no more valuable thing than the money that is useful for the welfare of humanity, but the money that causes ego does not make sense.
Let us earn money from the sacred purpose and spend it only for the sacred purpose.
It is the duty of every person to earn money for the maintenance of the family.
Part of this should also be a sense of expenditure on society, but the tendency to earn unaccounted collection or yen-ken type-charmony destroys our conscience, personality.
The feeling of charity should always be in the mind.
A fraction of the money you give can also become the basis of one's living.
We should all think for many people living in the society due to a terrible lack.
In fact, meaning, religion, work and salvation have been given equal importance in the purusharas of life.
Everyone wishes for wealth and fame and according to their efforts, they also get wealth and fame.
The wealth and wealth that is associated with is sustainable.
No matter how rich a criminal becomes, he can neither enjoy it properly nor be useful to anyone else.
If someone else has money, don't be jealous of it.
The true rich man is the one who makes the way to flow in the innumerable hands of wealth.
No one can make good use of money more than creating employment for others.
Another thing, money is not just in the form of money.
It would also be your health, character, love for others.
Try to be the master of this wealth.
The population of humans has crossed the 7 billion mark.
If the growth of the population continues like this, the time will come soon when it will be difficult to mobilize morsel for every hungry mouth.
According to experts, in the near future, humans will have no choice but to eat insects.
According to reports, a group of students from McGill University in Montreal won the Hult Prize for a unique project this year.
He has been given this award for preparing protein-rich flour from insects and spiders.
As a prize money, he has been given $1 million in assistance so that he can pursue his research and experiments.
In an interview to ABC News on September 30, Mohammad Eshore, chief student researcher of the group, said that now his team will do locust experiments for food items.
This report contains a detailed description of edible insects and spiders.
The Special Task Force (STF) has revealed that a fraud was committed in the 2012 PMT.
The STF has found fault with the roll numbers of 700 students in the investigation.
Around 125 students had taken admission in medical colleges.
Now the admissions of these students can be cancelled.
After the revelations of the STF, the Medical Education Department has started brainstorming to cancel the admissions of these students.
According to the information, the department is waiting to meet the list of all these suspected students from the STF.
The list will be sent to Vyapam to cancel the eligibility of the students involved.
However, the department is also seeking legal advice in this regard.
Departmental officials say that it has been a year for the students who have taken admission in the year 2012, so it is necessary to seek legal advice in this matter.
The medical education department officials are not in a position to say anything due to the fact that the case is limited to the STF investigation.
Vyapam director Tarun Pithore said that if the STF hands over the list of suspected students with evidence, their admissions will be cancelled immediately.
Director Medical Education Dr Nirbhay Srivastava said that if the fake admissions of the students were found to be correct, they have not even ruled out the cancellation of their admissions.
According to STF officials, fake students involved in the 2012 PMT are being investigated.
After the investigation, the list of suspected students will be handed over to Vyapam.
Vyapam had cancelled the eligibility of 345 suspected students in the PMT exam held in 2013.
Out of these 345, the medical education department has cancelled the admissions of 84 so far.
New anti-nicotine vaccine can end smoking enjoyment
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that can eliminate the fun from smoking.
The same dose of the vaccine was able to protect rats from nicotine addiction for the whole life.
There is a need for further testing before the trial is started on humans, which may take many years, but Ronald Crystal, professor at Weil Cornell Medical College in New York, said that the initial signs are positive.
"We very much hope that this type of vaccine strategy can eventually help millions of smokers who have tried to quit smoking using all the methods in the market today, but they found that their addiction to nicotine is much more powerful than these existing methods," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus, designed to deliver genetic information aimed at creating anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cell, which then begins to form a permanent stream of antibodies.
Antibody discovers any nicotine moleculars in the blood, and prevents the nicotine from getting nicotine in the smoker by neutralizing them before they reach the brain.
In the test, the vaccinated rats, which were later given nicotine, continued to perform their normal activities.
But the rat that was not given the vaccine "good" was a sign that the nicotine had reached his brain.
This experiment was described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The earlier tobacco vaccines had failed because they had antibodies.
It had to give a dose at regular intervals, so that the level of antibodies remained, but it proved to be expensive and impractical.
But the price of the new vaccine is expected to be a lot, as the liver will make the cell antibody's factory.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine is completely safe, it can be given to children before the greed of trying cigarettes, so that they can be protected from nicotine addiction.
But it will probably be used by smokers to quit smoking.
"They'll find out if they start smoking again they won't get any pleasure from smoking because of the nicotine vaccine, which can help get rid of their habit," he said.
British scientists described the result as interesting, but warned of the need to do a lot of research.
Her fans are also shocked to see what German-American model Heidi Klum did.
The young heartbeat Hedi was seen in such a way that it was difficult to recognize him.
His face and all his body were marked with age signs so much that he was shocked at a glance.

When a crowd of experts performing a horse for the best horse of the year had gathered at Cardiff, he knew it would be a challenging competition.
But no one was ready for a three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
A few months away from taking his first step, the little one and his petal Shetland's pondy Topi Tofi completed three steps very easily and received the top prize - surpassing 30 of his adult rivals.
In the annual competition hosted by the Sunnyback Equastrian Center in Rudry near Cardiff, the unable separated pair — which Sk is of length — was highly praised for the appearance, behavior, and style.
Wearing a beautiful bowler hat, he skewed his flat hat at an arrogant angle and made his two-year-old toffee round the ring.
The decision-makers praised Fenton for his natural skills to control which is far ahead of his age.
And the toffee got the highest marks for her appearance and personality.
Fenton was gifted to the toffee last March on her third birthday, and has since practiced daily with this pony from Shetland.
Her 30-year-old mother Donna said: "Fenton and Toffee are a fantastic pair."
He had to face challenge from all the candidates, but both of them won the gold cup and the roset.
This was only the second opportunity when he participated in a competition with the toffee, and we are all very happy with his victory.
The most distinguished in this theatre, he all felt so amazing that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The young boy from Nantiglo village near Abwell, South Wales, has been walking in the footsteps of his Aunty Scharon Howels, who has been demongrating horses for more than 10 years.
Mr. Wowels said: "The whole place was full of enthusiasm, and everyone was celebrating and clapping."
He was running on the sand in the entire theatre, and despite looking so small, he did extraordinary work.
Fenton is crazy about animals - she loves horses, tractors and fields, and has two chickens she takes care of.
The kind of start he has made will be in the best horse exhibition of the year long ago - and I am confident that he will perform very well.
A spokesman for the annual horse exhibition said: "Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to control his pony."
They are a very good couple.
The decision-makers gave points, given the manner in performance of Fenton and Toffee and the way they perform in the show ring.
He saw good team work between the pony and his rider - in this case the Fenton and the toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm pretty sure that Fenton's lovely clothes have helped him, he looked really different.
U.N. Sets New Goals to Deal with Poverty
The United Nations is immediately beginning to undertake work on a new Group of goals that will replace the millennium development goals that were launched 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
To replace the MDDs ending in 2015, the Australian diplomat in advancing the "Constitutible Development Goals" played a key role just before the Sustainable Development Summit began overnight in Rio de Janeiro.
These were included in the final format of the document, which will be supported by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the Summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the night summit that the time has come to "rise above national interests."
"I am very happy that the member countries have agreed to initiate and take over the process to establish universal sustainable development goals," he said.
These SDGs will be based on our development under the Millennium Development Goals, and will be a comprehensive part of the development framework after 2015.
I will do everything possible to implement the mandate given to me by our Member States to fulfill our far-reaching objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDG.

Tax on foreign property owners will end the artificial position of London
The Finance Department has calculated the CGT measures in provisionally, but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 Budget 2012 had offered stamp duty at the rate of 7 per cent for houses worth more than 2 million points, and persons who prefer to keep a house in a company rather than a separate person.
The stamp duty received from residential properties in the cities of Westminster and Kensington and Chelesa in 2012/13 was 708 million, which is already more than the combined sums of North Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and North East, North West and Yorkshire and Humber.
Mr. Cook pointed out: "After the increase in the stamp duty of high-value houses and the introduction of the Associated Anti-Avoidances legislation, it is very difficult to argue that there is a lower tax on high-value property, which has nothing to do with the influence of the old council tax system.
He added that "but this move can make some foreign investors silent in buying property in London and reluctant to sell existing owners"
Prime property, the richest South-West London, has grown a record 11.8 percent last year in a record 11.8 percent of the housing market, according to the value in the wealthy south-west London.
According to Savills research, central London prices continued to grow by 5.6 percent each year, but the rising "domestic market" seemed to be slightly lower than, as the city's southwest, north (7.4 percent) and east (6.5 percent) were seen rising.
In view of Diwali, the demand for sweets increases.
In view of this, the sale of substandard and fake mawas increases.
Chemicals are used to make sweets more shiny, colorful and sweet, which is dangerous for health.
The Food and Drug Administration Department has launched a campaign against fake mawa and chemical sweets.
The department seized Rs 70 lakh from Madhya Pradesh's Mawa and Rs 5 lakh from Quetta colony.
With the increase in the demand for sweets in the market, the demand for substandard mawa from Madhya Pradesh has also increased.
The department received information about bringing the poor mawe kept in the dirt from Madhya Pradesh to Nagpur.
A consignment of mawe is being procured from transport garages to Nagpur.
The department took possession of this mawa, the price of which was stated to be Rs 70 thousand.
No one has claimed responsibility for action.
The department destroyed it by assuming the unclaimed property.
The department raided the Jeetendra Caterers in Queta Colony and recovered a spoon of chamacham of about Rs 5 thousand.
A chemical called sodium hydrosulfite was used to shine bright and stay for a long time.
The sample will be sent to the laboratory.
S.S. Deshmukh, co-commissioner of the department, said that the campaign will continue to be streamed with chemical sweets and substandard and fake mawa.
The department has informed about the further speed of this campaign in the next few days.
The consumption of these sweets can also cause poisoning.
The department asked the sweet traders to make good milk, sweets from mawa.
The department has appealed to the people to be careful of fake sweets and mawa.
Believed in the first elected president independently in Egypt
Mohamed Morsi has sworn in his office, but his Victory Day could hardly end the political conflict in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised "new Egypt" when he was sworn in as the country's first independent elected president to replace Hosni Mubarak, who was removed 16 months ago.
On his formal installation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi Arab has become the first Islamist president of the world independently elected, and Egypt's fifth head of state after the removal of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took oath on his chair on the banks of the Nile before the 18 judges of the court with black cloaks, which looked like the ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are aspiring for a better future, a new Egyptian and another republic," Morsi said during a formal ceremony shown in live broadcast on national television.
The hardline group Muslim Brotherhood, which has spent 84 years since its inception, and which has been a target of previous governments, 60-year-old Morsi, a trained engineer at the party's U.S., said that "Today the people of Egypt have laid the foundation for new lives - complete freedom, true democracy and stability."
Hundreds of soldiers and police guarded the building and came to Morsi in a small convoy of cars shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Since Mubarak's time, only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the court to congratulate the new president, with traffic being stopped for a while, so that his motor convoy would normally leave the busy road, which connects the city center to its southern suburbs.
Morsi's personal reputation, which was ridiculed as a non-charisma "empty tyre" of the Brotherhood, grew a lot after his victory, and his speech on Friday presented him not only as an Islamist but also as a candidate for all those who want to complete the 2011 revolution against dictatorial Mubarak.
Wearing a blue business suit and a red tie, Morsi took oath before judges sitting in a wooden panel chamber, saying "Today Egypt is a citizen, national, constitutional and modern nation."
After that, Morsi moved to the University of Kyro, where he had to deliver his inaugural address.
They were officially welcomed by the military band by playing the national tune, while they stood in a careful posture.
Military ruler Field Marshal Hussain Tantavi was also present.
On his arrival, hundreds of people present at the lecture room at the main university there welcomed with the slogan that "the army and the people are one hand."
Established in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, the University of Kyro later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the years 1970.
On Friday, Morsi took a symbolic swear in Tahrir Square, the place of origin of the revolution that ended Mubarak's dictatorial regime last year, and took the oath of withdrawing the President's powers taken away from his office by the military council from the leader who was removed last year.
But by agreeing to take the official oath before the Court instead of the competent swearing-in of Parliament in the customary manner they bowed to the will of the Army, which is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi's speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic popular currencies.
You may not be sure, but that is true.
The Mission Road has been named after Nagar Parishad president Anjali Kumari.
In fact, the Jharkhand Vikas Yuva Morcha has made this name to express its displeasure over some of the bad roads of the city.
The programme was presided over by JMM Union Secretary Sachchidanand Pandey.
British police send extradition notice to Assange
British police today sent an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who has taken shelter at the Ecquadorian embassy in London and pleaded for shelter.
Scotland Yard said he had sent a "sussurdance notice" to the 40-year-old Australian Assange for which he would have to attend the police station, and said he would be responsible for being arrested if he failed to do so.
Assange, who is facing extradition to Sweden for sexual offences, ended his options under British law after the Supreme Court rejected his appeal against extradition earlier this month.
Stockholm would hand him over to the U.S., fearing that he requested asylum at the Ecwador embassy in London on June 19, telling the South American country for political shelter.
A spokesman said that the Scotland Yard has "sent a surrender notice to 40-year-old Assange, for which he needed to be present at the police station on the date and time we have chosen."
He is in violation of his bail terms.
The embassy refused to comment on the police notice.
Assange fears that the United States will be extradited from Sweden to face potential spy charges, due to the release of more than 250,000 U.S. diplomatic cables on an anti-secrecy website called WikiLeaks.
Officials of the department claim that this is the biggest TDS theft case of all time.
The group operator of the mall deducted TDS and paid it to the concerned financial institutions, but did not pay it in the government exchequer.
By doing this, TDS money was deposited with itself.
The group was taken up by the investigation team from Mumbai on October 17 along with the Jaipur exploration team.
During the investigation, it was found that the trader had deducted the TDS but did not deposit it.
For this reason, the TDS team had started the action of the Income Tax Survey on this group on Thursday.
About 15 days ago, raids and surveys were carried out on the group of this mall operator.
Angry over this action, the trader has made it clear to the officials of the Income Tax Department that they are not yet ready to pay TDS money to the Income Tax Department.
The Income Tax Department is continuously targeting them.
The investigating officers have clarified that in case of non-payment, recovery action will be taken by sealing the account.
Oil continues to decline towards $96 per barrel
Oil prices continue to fall towards Friday, a report showing concern over higher supply as is offset where the power-hungry construction sector in China is getting stronger.
The benchmark for December delivery was down 14 cents at $96.24 per barrel in Europe until late morning in electronic trading on the American crude New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract has fallen by 5.8 percent for the month of October, falling 39 cents on Thursday.
Adequate supply of crude oil has been weighed at the price in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies have increased by 4.1 million barrels last week
Over five weeks, supply has increased by more than 25 lakh barrels.
But a suggestion of strong demand has shown that two reports on sugar manufacturing have come on Friday.
This suggests that growth could continue to strengthen China's economic recovery after a two-decade-to-third quarter reduced to 7.8% in the last quarter.
Brent crude also fell 26 cents from $108.58 per barrel on the ICE exchange in London, a benchmark for international crude oil used by US refineries.
Pawan Bansal, who is in question from the opposition at the railway gate, shocked the opposition by saying that he did not look at anyone's woman in 15 years.
After this, everyone was surprised where the woman's talk came from.
Bansal was perhaps referring to the domestic relations of a senior BJP leader and a councillor.
Bansal then asked reporters that the BJP had hatched a conspiracy behind him during the last parliamentary elections to get a complaint by putting a woman behind him, which could not succeed.
Talking to reporters, Bansal said the CBI had questioned him in the railway bribery case.
If he was made a witness in the case, he would have been made only after thorough investigation?
Bansal said that in the booth scam, he must have written a letter for only one needy person in the booth scam.
If this is their sin, they will always commit such a sin.
Though the corporation did not have the constitutional right to raise the issue in the House, he himself asked the opposition to speak.
He said that as far as development works are concerned, the opposition will be given a list of 15 years of development works.
These people cannot even think of the way Chandigarh is developing or going to be.

Students studying technical and management courses on the campus will be able to exercise their franchise this time.
The Vice-Chancellor of the University has written a letter to the Governor for permission to hold the elections.
With the commencement of the admission process in the university, there was a demand for holding of student union elections.
He had also launched a signature campaign for the selection of his representative to reach his voice to the university administration and college management.
Students who have taken admission in about two dozen courses including B.Tech, MBA, Pharmacy, Biotechnology, Bioscience, Tourism Management and Paramedical Science will be able to choose their representative this year.

Vice-Chancellor Prof Ashok Kumar said that he has sought permission from the Governor to conduct elections in the university.
The date of the election will be announced once the permission is given.
"""It is the responsibility of the college management to conduct elections in other colleges."
Many college managements do not want the student union elections to be held on their campus.
At the same time, due to lack of unity among the students, elections are not being held.
The council had launched a signature campaign for the election.
Akash Jaiswal, Department Coordinator ABVP
After Diwali, the district administration will be asked to allow elections to be held in colleges.
There are also problems in this due to lack of clarity on the view of the colleges regarding the student union elections.
The entire market was littered with the customers in Rani Bagh Market.
It was recently that people had to wait for 15 to 20 minutes to buy the pot.
The same was the case at Wazirpur, Avantika Rohini, Naharpur, Ashok Vihar Central Market, and Central Market in Prashant Vihar.
Similar scenes were also seen at bullion shops in Pitampura, Ashok Vihar, Model Town.
People also bought gold and silver jewellery and coins.
Due to this, there was traffic jam in other markets including the outer ring road.
However, people who left the office to home had to spend hours in the jam to reach home.
Two employees of Y.MCA charged with sexual offences before allegations against Jonathan Lord, Royal Commission
Two employees of Y.M.C.A. NSW have been charged with child sexual offences before the charge was levelled against Jonathan Lord, Carringbah, child care worker, in 2011.
But in its statement before the Commission, it said it "never came to light a case of child sexual harassment within its organisation", the commission was told.
Chief Executive Officer Philip Hare was asked about the case in which an employee of the YMCA was charged with child pornography crimes, and another case in which the YMCA Carringbah Gym instructor was charged with child sexual offences against children living in his care in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Advocate Gail Furness, who assisted the commission, said he was aware of the first case, but he did not know about the second case.
He also admitted that the statement of the YMCA before the Commission that "External investigation of YMCA has been conducted and he has found YMCA at the forefront of child protection" is also not accurate.
There is evidence before the Commission that the YMCA was notified, and it received the second lowest rating in four possible ratings in the Department of Education and Community in Quality Audit in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who is associated with the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that the management had failed "including me myself" for appointing Lord, and failed to ensure that the employees were clearly aware of their obligations relating to reporting child safety policy violations.
Lord was convicted for sexual offences with 12 children during his two-year tenure at Y.MCA earlier this year.
He was sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum of six years.
But Mr. Hare denied the suggestion that the YMCA had a cultural problem, due to which the staff did not report child safety violations by the Lord.
The staff gave evidence that Lord spent alone with children, having them to personally get babysitting, putting them in the lap, telling them that he loved them and letting them play on their mobile phones.
Daniel Auckwell, under the supervision of Lord, and had said for child safety training, because she was concerned about her behaviour, testified that Y.MCA Carringbah, who supervised Lord, was "very bully and hard to get most of the time."
The CEO said he did not accept the evidence of the employees that they were not comfortable in giving information above their manager.
She stated that, rather, their friendship with Lord misled their decision to inform about him.
Mr. Hare said that he had given his view to the Y.MCA NSW Mandal that, the text for the organization from the "Jonathan Lord Event" was "about not giving".
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the secrecy agreement by the employees was taken by YMCA child service General Manager Lyam Whitele soon after the allegations came to light.
He said the purpose was to avoid blending of evidence, but it was not "extrestant" and properly executed.
Stephen Smallbonne, Special Professor at the University of Griffith, said that YMCA NSW was not a safe organization during Jonathan Lord's work between 2099 and 2011.
He said that there were "spoin problems" in the appointment, monitoring, induction, training and supervision of employees.
The hearing has been adjourned till December 20.
Ponbrokers Silver in Singapore due to difficulty by middle class
Janani Amirthalinga is taking cash from her daughter's school fees to pay her daughter's school fees at the Bendemyer shopping centre in Singapore.
"My husband and I have recently bought a house, so all our money is stuck in it," said Mrs. Amirthalinga.
She says that, although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ($2,400 US) as an administrator, and her husband also works, but the family's monthly income remains insufficient.
In fact, there is similar demand in parts of Southeast Asia - where domestic debt is increasing - Valuemax where they are making their transactions, becoming the third pawnshop to be listed on Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Pledging jewellery is not the only way to get cash - in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga at 1,300 Singapore dollar - but also as cheap as an almost unsecured bank loan.
Ponbrokers in Singapore typically charge 17 percent interest per annum, little more than 15.4 percent offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, Ponbrokers have the advantage of not requiring credit check-up or salary proof, and they can provide loans faster than the bank.
Millions of people in the region are approaching ponshop due to increasing living expenses by families and hardship due to increased domestic and consumer credit.
After five years of strong growth after a global financial disaster, and cheaper credit due to simple monetary policy in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are approaching Ponshop to meet their needs due to the slowdown of their economy.
This week, the rating agency, Standards Anz Puers, described the growing domestic gains mainly due to mounting mortgages, a risk factor for the creditability of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest domestic debt in proportion to GDP in Asia, it said.
Malaysia is at the top position in this list with 80 percent of GDP, compared to 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are concerned about high levels of consumer credit in Thailand, which has emerged lightly from the tech recession this week.
On Thursday, data showed a sustained export slowdown and a decrease in consumer demand.
"The point is that with rising prices, people coming from middle to lower classes will try to increase their income in every possible way," said Song Song Seng Wun, economist at the Malaysian Bank, CIMB.
Historically high values in gold prices over the past two years have led people to pledge personal assets, as they are taking advantage of the opportunity to redeem the values of their family's jewellery.
Gold is gold, down the 70 per cent of the stolen items in the City-State's 200 pon outlets in Singapore.
People are saying "the gold price is looking good, let's pledge grandmother's gold chain, and take it back next month."
Thailand's largest pawnshop operator, EasyMony, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its outlets in recent months.
The pledger business is such a growth that Valuemax, the operator of the outlet in Bendymir, and 15 others like it in Singapore, are planning to expand not only in their neighborhood, in Malaysia where it has four shops, but also plans to expand outside of Asia, says Yah Li Ching, executive director of Valuemax.
The company will finance it using 60 per cent of the $66 million Singapore dollar received in the listing this week on Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some discount lenders (lenders) have been criticized because of higher interest rates, Ms. Yah says that pledge not only offers cheaper rates than other lenders, but it also does not directly increase the loan.
"Customers mortgage items that they already have, and capitalising on personal assets does not increase domestic debt," she says.
The social acceptance of ponbroking is increasing to get short-term and safe financial assistance.
It is not that only financially weak people use pornbrokers.
Rich people in Singapore also use Valuemax outlets, they pledge gold bars or Rolex watches, which can fetch up to 60 per cent of their purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all sections of society.
"These include wealthy individuals who need a short-term loan for a business venture or investment, or small businesses that need to meet their cash flow requirements," says Ms Yah.
Sometimes they need money in just a short time.
From utensils to gold and silver in the capital on Dhanteras, people have bought a lot of money from utensils and silver.
Such purchases have increased by 20-30 per cent compared to last year
In Shimla, people were engaged in jewellery shops.
From the lower market to Malroad, there was also a lot of crowd in the utensil shops.
Although inflation was on such items this year, people still did not show sking in shopping on auspicious times.
On Friday, the auspicious Muharat for shopping was from 7:52 am to 10:12 am and from 1:56 to 3:37 pm and from 6:17 am to 8:12 pm.
During the time of the said three Muhurat, a large crowd of people gathered in the suburbs including Shimla to buy more.
In Shimla Lower Bazar, people did not find a place to sit on foot.
Every small shop was crowded in the same way.
In such a situation, when shopping on Dhanteras, celebrated as Trayodashi Dhantrayodashi of Krishna Paksha in the month of Kartik, is a sign of auspicious Diwali.
According to information, on Thursday, an urban willow nursery named Habibullah Malla was going towards Haritara-Sopore.
Suddenly he was attacked by a bear.
He made noise for help while resisting the bear.
By the time people from nearby reached the spot to help him, the bear had eaten his face badly.
People shouted stones at the bear.
On this he left Habibullah and hid in the nursery.
The injured were rushed to a hospital for treatment.
$325 million rescue package for Tagi's health
The Union government has stressed that the $325 million rescue package for the sick health system of Tasmania is also associated with stringent conditions which will ensure that the state government does not waste the funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is "immediate action" to address the current crisis caused by the state's aging population, high rates of chronic diseases, and system limitations.
The decision to financed over the course of four years was taken after consultation with the government with Tasmania's independent MP Andrew Wilki.
"The government has brought an emergency rescue package, which we believe will address the special challenges faced by the State," Ms. Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package also includes an alternative surgery plan of $31 million.
2600 additional operations, including orthopaedic and cataract surgery, will help resolve past collected cases.
This includes funds for walk-in clinics in Hobart and Lancastes, better care after hospital, training of medical experts, mental health services and introduction of individual electronic health records system in local hospitals.
"These investments are in line with the best ways I have been told by leading physicians to improve Tasmania's health system," Ms. Plibbersek said.
The Minister stressed that the government of Tasmania will face strict reporting and accountability regime.
The State has to maintain the current financial standards to receive Commonwealth funds, and report every month on where the additional funds are being spent.
A three-member commission will be constituted to ensure that the service is provided by the State in an effective and efficient manner as possible.
Mr. Wilki said that the $325 million would not mean much, "until real reforms are made to take Tasmania's public health system to a more sustainable level."
Yet he praised the government for reacting to his request for immediate assistance, which he first brought to the Prime Minister in early May."
"I hope the federal assistance package will be very helpful towards separating the state re public health system from the crisis-hit list," Mr. Wilki said.
According to the state government, these additional alternative processes will mainly undo recent deductions.
But Federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's announcement is "a band-aid solution."
"We are here for this reason because the Labour State government has taken $430 million in its health system," he told A.B.C. TV.
You cannot accept about half a billion dollars by the state government and the Commonwealth giving $300 million as a good news day.
Mr. Duttan demanded that Ms. Plibbersek should guarantee that not a single dollar from the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Promote corporate fear from the NSA's disclosures about state surveillance.
Late on a quiet day in August, a German police helicopter spotted at the US consulate in Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Office (BfV) to protect the Constitution, Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take a picture of the roof of the US outpost, which is located at a distance of less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundisbunk.
The German media asked BfV to express hope to identify the presence of Lissing Antenna and indicated an exchange action between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clepper, the director of U.S. National Intelligence, stressed that the US should not use its foreign intelligence capabilities to "stect the trade secrets of foreign companies and to increase their international competitiveness or increase their downstream."
But since Edward Snowdon, a contractor who became a whistleblower, began to tell American surveillance, the European government and business leaders are no longer sure if the director does not obey his words.
The US National Security Agency spied on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and our cloud providers including Google and Yahoo and Yahoo expressed fears about state surveillance.
The last thing came when it turned out that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged, possibly a decade ago.
If Europe's most powerful individuals may be targeted, business leaders are certainly also aiming for a potential.
Snowden has made in-depth cooperation between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I think it would be viable to use these data for mutual benefit.
"Germany should wake up," says Oliver Grün, the president of BITMi, who represents small and medium-sized German IT companies.
According to a survey published by the consultancy of German companies in July, the US has now become a big risk like China, when it comes to industrial spying and data to steal.
All the documentation leaked by Mr. Snowden, however, there is no evidence to date that the US has known the business secrets of foreign companies for its companies.
Politicians have expressed concern over the lack of internet capabilities of the EU. And it should strive to reduce its dependence on the US.
The leaders of the business world are doubting this.
Someone in the German Parliament said that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and gently open them again...
The chairman of Haso Platner, German business software company SAP, said "this is no way," said .
If someone wanted a strong European IT industry, then he had to not let him die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany., from coal, car, to farmers.
But the IT industry is everything.
The revelations exposed by Snowdon about US technological sophistication and spy access have been proven as a shock to some companies who previously believed that China is the biggest surveillance threat
A major change is taking place in the cloud computing area where European officials are more aware that data stored in the US is under that jurisdiction and has therefore become potentially sensitive.
According to a survey conducted by a business body, some 10 percent of non-US members canceled plans to use a US-based cloud provider after disclosures about the data prism mining program.
Jim Snabe, SAP's co-chief executive officer, says: "We saw a new question that customers didn't come a year ago – that is -where my data is stored? And can you guarantee that it will physically remain that jurisdiction?"
Many German officials argue that the latest reports are just confirming what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most prized secrets and data and therefore should be guarded at all costs.
That economic espionage is not a surprise.
It has always happened.
"It's been a topic for many years, and through the fundamental current discussion, nothing changed," says Kurt Bock, chief executive of chemical manufacturer BASF.
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level and we also do it, because it is in the national interest to defend our business
Corporate leaders are generally not inclined to the defense system and this is an advantage for the attacker.
For large companies, the message has been recording for a long time whether it is goofy to leave a business from home to using usb sticks, or leaving a laptop in a hotel room is unwise to say the least.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a board member of the carmaker Audi, says that this is a year old system to collect mobile phones before board meetings because they could not be used as remote listening devices.
Germany's BfV executive advises to consider using simple prepaid mobiles when smart phones are compromised due to risk on tours abroad.
The prepaid mobile phones were then thrown away later.
However, small and medium companies are at risk of hacking and monitoring it is a concern.
In Germany, it is the first in many companies in the global market.
"Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access," BfV warns in a report.
The US has warned about the economic espionage of its own companies by other countries.
According to the France The Washington Post, in February the name of US national intelligence behind China with Russia and Israel, the economic intelligence, named in a second-year of criminals engaged in hacking.
According to the board member of a German blue chip company when it comes to doing economic spying, "Frenchs are the worst
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, explains in the interview: "Services are well aware that even if they support in non-terrorist fight, spying on their allies."
Americans spy on us at commercial and industrial level and we also do it, because it is in the national interest to defend our business
No one became a fool.
Participants from Godda, Pakur, Jamshedpur, Dhanbad, Hazaribagh and Chatra districts participated in the training.
During the seven-day period, all the participants were briefed about tent pitching, flag poles and many other disciplines.
The training is being fulfilled in collaboration with Dr. Ashutosh Kumar Rai and Isha Ghosh.
By joining the prayer of all religions, all the participants are spreading the spirit of unity.
Vipin Kumar, the state training commissioner, is assisting the camp.
State media member Ajay Rai said that he will go on a smoke campaign there from November 4th.
Bhagat will focus himself in the assembly constituencies of Chhattisgarh adjacent to Jharkhand.
They are well aware of these areas.
He will continue to migrate to Chhattisgarh till November 16.
There is a huge demand of Jharkhandi leaders in the election summer of Chhattisgarh.
More than two dozen BJP leaders have already been present there.
The Congress had also requested JMM supremo Shibu Soren and Chief Minister Hemant Soren to campaign in favour of the party in Chhattisgarh, which has been accepted by the top leadership of the JMM.
The JMM has also removed its 10 candidates who have already been declared from the election.
The JMM has directed the Chhattisgarh State Committee to join the election campaign in favour of the Congress.
The disappointment of Obama's voters
I voted for Obama twice in order to change.
He says that Obama's great efforts have been disrupted due to the policy of GOP's inhibition
Obstacle policy The troubles of the Obamacare website can't give excuses for drone attacks
The 2008 campaign of Obama's 2008 campaign reminds me of what could have happened
Nathaneal P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading very sad books today.
This is a book that I think will encourage me during the second year of medical school sadness and a ray of hope in me.
Its name is "Dare to win," and is a memoir of Barack Obama's 2008 presidential campaign.
When I get rid of my patients' perches at night and go to bed, this book takes me to a time in which politics inspired millions of people and the speech could hold your breath.
Elections proved to be one-sided, and news speakers took a break to show the historical importance of the time.
My classmates had tears of joy in their eyes, and my parents saved each of the newspapers.
A group of young visionaries were going to the White House, and the whole country was ready for change.
Obama had an approval rating of 82 per cent during his tenure as president in 2008
And then I closed the book.
The truth of the present is a harsh truth, as if coming back from the world of dreams.
Those days of hope are hard to remember - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad memory of the lost opportunities.
There was a really change after I voted for the first time.
In simple terms, none of these could have imagined.
I attribute to Obama many achievements, from the Affordable Care Act to the withdrawal of our army from Iraq, to the end of "do not ask" until Osama bin Laden was killed.
Also I believe that the policy of biased opposition has prevented a lot of efforts to advance our country: including immigrant reform, public choice for healthcare, closure of base at Guantanamo Bay, among others.
But innumerable times in which I have ended the answer to the Obama administration in front of my colleagues and colleagues, which I can give them.
I have reached the point of political despair.
Republican opposition policy is not the answer to spying on foreign leaders, nor is the answer to drone attacks on innocent children abroad.
It cannot respond to the national security agency collecting data about the personal lives of ordinary U.S. citizens, nor can respond to indicts people who expose the government's wrongdoings.
This cannot explain the reason for the murder of American citizen Anwar L. Avalaki without trial, nor is it the lack of public funds and expenditure limits during the presidential campaign.
This cannot answer the findings of the report, which says the White House's attempts to silence the media "has been the most aggressive since the Nixon administration."
And most recently, it cannot give an excuse for the failure to design a simple website even after three years of being signed into law of the Affordable Care Act.
I dont know if I expected that.
If, at the age of 18, I should have guessed that the system of governance could refute the political campaign that brought it forward.
It is obvious that the elected office is not a predictable route, because opposing political parties and random events such as the Newtown murder case will shape our public discussion.
Yet the above examples seem to have been chosen by the administration mostly by the administration.
This is most disturbing for you.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was thrilled by his candidature.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and uncertain choice that did not seem like determining his policies or his position.
I felt that a second term for Obama, which would be free from the pressure of future elections, would fulfill the hopes that we have been hearing about for a long time.
Nevertheless, while Obama's annubation rating is less than 45 percent this week, it has become very difficult to return in the year 2008 through that book.
Seeing him, I remember his disappearances.
Reading a part of the book this week, describing how Clinton had suffered a huge loss due to Obama in the Pennsylvania primary.
In a post-mortem campaign meeting, he told his subordinate staff that they needed to return to track, and to remain honest with their objectives.
He said, "I want to get my mojo back."
We must remember who we are.
Today, five years later, the President cannot agree with you any more.
The views expressed in this comment are from Natheniel Morris.
The monitoring group said that Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons-making ability
On Thursday, the monitoring group said Syria had destroyed important equipment to create chemical weapons and toxic gas war materials, while a fierce conflict emerged in the northern part of Syria, which is very close to the location where toxic agents are believed to be kept.
On Thursday, the Syrian Movement Group said that about 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of Syria's civil war that began nearly three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation on Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came a day before the last date of November 1
The Hague-based organization had set up Dumscus to mix chemicals in all chemical weapons production units and toxic gases and destroy the machinery used to fill in combat materials or "ineffective".
The completion of the initial phase of destruction, mainly the completion of the early phase of destruction, is a meaningful milestone in this ambitious development that aims to destroy all the chemical weapons of the DMS in the middle of 2014.
To destroy the equipment means that Syria can no longer create new chemical weapons.
However, the existing arms and collection of the Dumcus still have to be destroyed.
Syria is believed to have 1000 metric tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and nerve agent Sarin.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported that the announcement came at a time when there was an increase in conflict in the city of Safira on Thursday, which experts believe it is a chemical weapons production unit as well as a collection center.
The movement group, which details the death toll through the movement's network in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people have died.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6,365 children, it said.
The government said that 29,954 are members of the military army of President Bashar Assad, 18,678 are fighters in favor of the government and 187 are Lebanese Hizbollah militants.
It also said that among the dead are 2,202 army fugitives and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom are foreigners.
On July 25, the U.N. estimated that about 100,000 people have died in the conflict that has been going on since March 2011.
It has not updated the data since.
Due to this struggle, about 20 lakh people have been forced to leave the country.
Assad's military contingent fought rebels in Safira for several weeks, many of whom belonged to Al-Qaeda groups.
On Thursday, the Observatory said that there were casualties from both sides, but clearly did not say anything.
This war reflects the threat faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in a very short time-frame, have a mission to eliminate toxic weapons in Syria during the ongoing civil war.
The O.P.C.W., who works closely with the United Nations, said its team "is still satisfied and has confirmed - and has seen all of Syria's declared important production and mixing/filling equipment – destroyed."
"No further inspection activity is being planned," it added.
Earlier this week, the inspectors had said that they had completed the first phase of the confirmation work by visiting 21 of the 23 centres announced by Dumskus.
The inspectors said they were not able to visit two centres due to security reasons.
On Friday, the O.P.C.W. said that according to Syria, these two centers have been "renounced and... the chemical weapons product items kept there were transported to other declared centers, which have been inspected."
It was not immediately clear whether the unit in Safira is one of the two centres where the inspectors of the OPCW were not able to go.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPCW next month.
"I salute the firmness and courage shown by you in the most challenging missions undertaken by this organization so far," said Ahmed Ujumku, Director-General of the group, in a comment released by OPCW.
This three-year civil war is mainly: the massacre of Assad's government and its security forces, besides members of the Eit cult, and the conflict between the rebel Sunni Muslims.
In another development, Observatory chief Rami Abdurrehman said there was a massive explosion on Wednesday at the Air Defence Center in the Syrian coastal region of Latakia.
He said the cause of the explosion was not yet known.
In the case of Nortel patent, an economic lawsuit has been filed against Google, Samsung, Huawei.
Thousands of former Nortel patents-owned groups have filed many patent lawsuits against Google, including cell phone manufacturers, to which it had overtaken the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The consortium called Rockstar, which bought non-retail patents for 4.5 billion, has sued Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd, HTC Corporation, Huawei and four other companies for a patent violation in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericssh and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
The indictment said that these patents also include the technology that match the words to be searched on the Internet with relevant advertising, which is the main part of Google's search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar could not be contacted immediately.
Samsung, Huawei, and HTC all make these phones that run on Google's Android operating system, which compete with Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid for Nortel patents for $900 million.
Google finally proposed $4.4 billion, increasing the bid several times.
After losing to Rockstar in Nortel patents, Google bought Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, one of the main reasons why Motorola had a long list of patents.
The indictment said that "Google has violated, and is constantly violating, despite losing in an attempt to acquire patents-in-suet in the auction"
Rockstar has sought increased compensation against Google for claiming that Google's patents violation is a rudatory.
FA: Aircraft travelers can now use gadgets in the aircraft (but can't call from cell phones)
Airplannes will be able to use their electronic device to read, work, play games, watch movies, listen to music from entering the gate to getting off the gate — but will not be able to talk to their cellphones - is under high-pregnated new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration on Thursday.
But passengers should not expect these changes immediately.
Speaking at a news conference, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said how fast these changes are implemented would vary from airline to airline.
The airlines must show the FAA how their aircraft complete the new guidelines, and how they are updating the training booklets of their crew members and the rules for collecting devices to show the guidelines.
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices on the aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
The FAA said in a statement, "Based on the state of planning, we can very quickly approve the extended use of electronic devices.
At present, passengers need to turn off their smartphones, tablets, and other devices when the airport is closed.
They are expected not to turn on the aircraft until they arrive at an altitude of 10,000 feet and are allowed by the captain.
Passengers are expected to turn off their devices again when the plane lands, and do not turn on until the aircraft is completely unloaded.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are completely safe from electronic disruptions may allow their passengers to fly by aircraft, while landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airline companies and other aircraft that have been modified in such a way that passengers can use WiFi at higher altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Gleding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, welcomed the changes.
"When the policy is implemented safely — and we will work closely with airlines to do so - it will be a win-win for both sides," Glading said in a statement.
When it comes to this issue, we are bored feeling like "haul monitors."
But surfing, email exchange, sending or receiving messages, or downloading data will still be restricted by connecting the internet at a height of less than 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to keep their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So there will still be no conversations with friends, an online scrabble-like game, the famous incident associated with which is that in the year 2011, actor Alec Baldwin, was playing on his smartphone while the plane was parked at the door, and when he refused to turn off the device, American Airlines took off.
And heavy equipment like laptops etc. will still have to be collected because their jumping will cause the other person to be hurt in the cabin.
Cellphone calls will also continue to be restricted during the flight.
The regulatory rights relating to phone calls are with the Federal Communications Commission, not with the FAA.
The FAA may lift restrictions on certain electronic devices during the flight and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosencan of the National Transport Safety Board, who is a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones are still considered risk.
"Cell phones are a really serious issue, not just because they can potentially cause disruptions to navigation-related devices, but also because they can cause disruptions to cell phone towers when they're in the air," Rojenker said.
The Industry Advisory Committee constituted by the FAA to examine the issue last month recommended that the government should allow greater use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA to reduce the restrictions on their use has been increasing in recent years.
Critics like Claire McCaskillock, D-Mo have said that there is no valid security reason for prohibition.
The enforcement of these restrictions is becoming even more difficult because the use of the device is omnipresent.
Some studies also indicate that about a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their device.
The FAA began banning the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1996 when reports of disruption of navigation and communication devices were received due to the transport of FM radio and high-technology gadgets by passengers at that time.
New airline companies are more dependent on electrical systems than the previous generation of aircraft, but they have also been designed and approved by the FAA to be resistance to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi access to cruising altitudes from passengers for many years.
Aircraft modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to disruption.
Huerta said most airline companies should meet the eligibility criteria for greater use of electronic devices under the new guidelines.
Today's electronic devices, more than the previous generation of electronic devices, emit very little of the radio transmission of.
For example, e-readers are a very nominal transmission when the page is overturned.
But transmissions are strong when downloading or sending data by device.
Amazon.com has also been among those who favored reducing the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's executives loaded their entire Kindle e-readers in airlines and flew to test the problems but did not find any such problems.
The FAA Advisory Committee has expressed mixed feelings about the risk caused by the use of the device.
Douglas Kid of the National Aircraft Traveller Association said he believes that the disruption caused by the device is real, even if the risk is nominal.
Other members of the committee said that, there are reports only described by the pilot in support of the device being disrupted in the aircraft system, most of which are very old.
The members of the committee, however, recommended that the FAA pilot be allowed to order the passengers to switch off the device at the time of landing the aircraft with low visibility.
The Travel Industry Group has welcomed the changes and described them as a common sense facility for people travelling in the latest era of technology.
We are delighted that the FAA has recognized that the passenger travelling with joy is not inconsistent with the rescue and safety, said Roger Doe, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Mick Jagger says that when Katy Perry was 18, he did not attack him

A recent media report said that the NSA flew information from Yahoo and Google's data centers for spying.
The Washington Post made the disclosure on the basis of documents collected from former NSA contractor Edward Snowdon.
According to the report, the NSA's program was named Muscular, which he ran in collaboration with his British counter part-GCHQ.
Both agencies stole data passing through the huge fiber optic cable network laid by Yahoo and Google.
The Washington Post quoted a top secret document dated January 9, 2013, as saying that more than 18 crore documents were collected only 3 days after the programme began.
These include email, text, audio and video messages.
According to the Washington Post, the program was run out of the US and an benami telecommuncation provider helped the NSA access to this information.
According to the newspaper, it was easier for the NSA to run this program outside the US, because such campaigns in the US need to have court orders.
NSA Chief General Keith Alexander denied the allegations during a press conference in Washington, saying, As far as I know, it has never happened.
The NSA has always collected all the information within the purview of the law.
The NSA was recently targeted for spying on the German Chancellor.
The United Nations said Wednesday that the US administration has assured not to monitor its communication system.
The US has also said that the UN communication system is not monitored.
GM calls back pickup trucks in U.S. to correct seatback
According to a tip-off from the U.S. Auto Safety Regulators on Friday, the General Motors Company has recalled about 19,000 trucks to correct a reduction in hand-verbating seatbacks in its brand new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Serra pickup trucks.
Some trucks may have a reduction in the front seat rotation system.
As a result, the association about the seatback, head restrant, failed to comply with the auto safety standards.
According to a notice posted on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, "If the vehicle gets stuck from behind, it is possible that the head resort may not protect the driver properly, which will increase the risk of injury."
The recalled models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10.
GM trucks began to be shipped in June and this is the most important watch launch for the top U.S. automaker after the 2009 bankruptcy renewal.
The GM had informed the truck owners about this defect in the second half of October.
NSTMA The owner could not review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had disrupted the increase in auto sales in October.
GM said on Friday that, the sales of Silverado and Serra trucks that were redesigned for the 2014 model year, had a 20 percent increase in the first 10 months of this year.
In October, the GM had sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sera pickup trucks.
GM's stock jumped 1.4 percent in New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon.

In Agra, a sub-inspector was killed and four others were seriously injured when a direct collision took place in a truck and a police jeep in Agra this morning.
The speeding jeep of the police rammed into the truck near Tora police outpost under Tajganj police station area this morning.
Sub-Inspector Register Singh died on the spot while four constables were seriously injured in the accident.
All of them have been admitted to the hospital.
The schools pledged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar.
In English literature courses, students must read at least a play of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and a contemporary British story after 1914.
The exam will also include "not seen lessons" to encourage more and more reading.
A combined English literature and language course will be abolished.
Since 2015, students will have to take a separate G.C.SEE in the language, and will be very inducted to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Department of Education will release a new syllabus for English and Mathematics tomorrow - both of which will be the first subject in which there will be a revolutionary change.
It will also change the second major topics next year.
In a separate step, the exam regulators will demonstrate changes in the structure of the GCSE with the official, new grading system, and less syllabus.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that "there was a lot of consensus that, to restore people's trust, we need to improve our testing system," he said, adding that the GCSE would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous."
Studies found that English schools devote less time to mathematics - 116 hours a year or - 3 hours less a week during sessions than in most countries.
According to comparison Australians provide students with an average of 143 hours a year, while Singapore has an average of 138 hours.
While there is no formal need to give more time to mathematics, the coalition sources said that the broader mathematics GCSE - league table was likely to encourage additional teaching to provide additional teaching in schools by combining overweight with subjects.
This course will focus more on "real world problems, including financial mathematics."
Large orders of jet manufacturers from controversy to seat width at stake.
This month's Dubai Arsho has been a spree with a competition for the fights between leading aircraft manufacturers for the width of tourist-class seats for long-distance flights.
The controversy focuses on the width of the economy class seat in long flights, not always being given by the arlines, but the allotted location efficiency is claimed by the latest Jet Erbus SAS and Boeing company to be the key.
Erbus is expected to give a wide seat of at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the Economy cabin this week, but it should be decided by the arlines, its main-rival Boeing says.
The dispute comes between the aircraft manufacturers when the order, which was recorded after the 17-21 incident, saw a race to sell the twin engine of the long-range Ercroft's twin engine.
How is the previous department of the aircraft built - especially whether seating is 9 or 10 equal, keeping in mind the more capacity threats, the design of mini jumbo jets is being prepared?
Boeing says it has been built "777 X", which will keep 406 people 17 inches wide and 10 people in a row in a monogamous department.
Airbus says that while staking the A350, it will take 350 people in the seat left 18 inches left in 9 equal seats.
Aircraft giants often strike business on technical matters through advertising in the business press.
Now, Airbus is expected to dominate more than 100 orders in Dubai Arsho with 777 X, so further appealing to the public.
Recently, it is being seen that whatever the beginning of the Wigiapan war, this Finnsero, will you accept this at once in a restaurant?
Airbus sales chief John Lehi said "from the Boeing Regional Turbo also offering long distance flights to the narrows."
As a change, people may be getting bigger, but the way of sitting on the plane is not changed.
According to data from the U.S. Department of Health, between the 1970s when the Boeing 747 jumbo ne modern long-term trips were defined to tha, and the ant me average of the century was 40 - 49-year-old American male's weight increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American male has a waist of 39.7 inches in the 21st century.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950 seat concept when the average perimeter of the new name "Jet Set" was narrow.
Airbus says that they have set up a research commission suggesting an improvement in the quality of sleep by one additional inch 53 percent of the seat width.
Boeing has disputed Airbus's seat measurement statistics, and said it does not depend on the decision of the manufacturers to decide how airlines strike a balance between fares and facilities.
It also says that research shows that the width of a seat depends on the experience of the cabin more than the width.
"It really explains what they need to do to be successful," Boeing cabin expert Kent Kraver said, adding that it really explains what they need to do to succeed in providing flexibility to the airlines."
"They don't want to tell us what they benefit from."
They know their business better than anyone else.
For flyers it's about elbow room, but for suppliers it's increasingly an issue that it can affect income.
The trade at least $700 billion is behind the controversy. The aircraft order competition is enough in the coming decades to tip the scales of American and European exports.
For the first time in July, the Reuters report said that whether seat layout is actually a battle issue between new jets.
Airbus and Boeing claimed that 20 percent of the work is expected per seat, their new twin-engine design of the leader of that segment, compared to the 365-seat Boeing 777-300 er.
The claim of Boeing's performance depends on the comparison of the 10-wale 777 X One original 9 with 777 design.
10 equals in unit cost with profit now have been used comparison.
Kevin Keniston, head of the Airbus passenger facility of Europe says "Boing's this is their aircraft to capture more seats to make our products, more competitive".
On the other hand, analysts say the entire 10-seat-per-row cabin for the existing 777 S suggests that many passengers favor the Denser layout, which can at the same time go with cheap fares..
The cabin insider expert Mary Karbi, founder and editor's runway girl network said, "The eighteen-inch seat width will be great for passengers, but the reality is that this trade point of Airbus is driven by the threat of proposal 777"
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats but are providing a list for airlines suppliers to choose from.
Jet vendors around the world should also take careful measures to check this layout competition.
While more comfortable, all builders are also offering high-density layouts for low-cost aircraft and regional travel of jets.
Airbus is giving a 10 equal A350 but says it is not sold yet.
Until recently, Airbus insisted on extensive cabin seats on some of its jets for needing more cabin convenience.
Modern jets are unlikely to fly on a new industry standard without the support of other manufacturers but it could distract from the 777 X sales wave.

Precedentation: Growing up early
Research shows that African-Americans and Hispanic girls gain puberty at a young age than white girls of their age.
Physical change does not mean that puberty is near
There is no evidence that hormones or any other chemical can be blamed
Experts believe that macroprots outbreaks can be a cause of puberty at a young age
The case of premature puberty is not as effective in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Ethridge is an expert journalist in children's health and family issues.
Should the mother be worried if her daughter develops breasts and genital hair begins at the age of 7 or 8?
Dr. Paul Caplovitz, a pediatric endocrinologist at the American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando, Florida this week, clarified that these early physical changes are common in American girls, showing new trend.
"I spend a lot of time in assuring parents that it generally doesn't reflect the rapid progress towards full-fledged youth," says Caplovitz.
Direct symptoms of growth such as sproutation of breasts, genital and armpit hair and physical odors are visible prematurely in girls.
But in the last four decades, the age of Rajodarshan (first menstrual cycle) has changed a very minor.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, up from 12.75 in 1970.
"When breasts begin to develop, it takes at least two to three years in the first performance," explains Caplovitz, who explains "pre-puberty in girls: the guide needed to deal with this common problem."
The most accurate test time for the development of puberty.
There is a debate about what is the beginning of puberty, but when the breast growth increases with the age of 8. Two call it "child-adult".
In most cases, the procedure will slow down or stop - which the pediatrician can inspect closely.
In the event of a more rapid progress, an endocrinologist may require an investigation to overcome the chances of serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
Treatments for premature menstruation and other outcomes are: premature age-increasing of bones, which can lead to undeveloped growth and nata stature as an adult.
Recommends for drug or hormone treatment depend on the child's age, growth rate, growth rate, and emotional adulthood.
Psychological aspects are also important.
Caplovites are aware of drugs but admits, "Suppressing puberty can increase behavioral issues, and girls may feel different from their peers."
The second major problem can be understood: Parents simply don't want their young daughter to have menstruation.
"They worry about the risk of pregnancy, or how they will maintain hygiene," Caplovitz said.
A woman, whose daughter had started menstruating at the age of 10, recalls, "It was a shock."
Although there were symptoms and we talked about menstruation, it was not emotionally prepared.
She was scared of her school and returned upset that she first started menstruation in her friends.
There are many well-planned principles about the causes of untimely puberty.
However, there is no constant evidence that milk or other food items can accuse hormones, chemicals in the environment or sexual oriented messages in the media.
Boys are also getting puberty before time.
Caplovites rules that the main cause of this is the outbreak of grossness.
She had assisted in conducting studies over girls between 6 and 9 years in 2001, which combines body fat with puberty times.
Other results support this conclusion, but there are many other factors contributing to it.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanic girls tend to get puberty before white girls of their age.
There are many explanations for this.
Globally, the pattern of premature puberty appears to be all affected by things, from economic conditions to weather and jeans.
Other puzzles: Although boys are getting facial and genital hair at an early age, the practice of puberty is not as clear as the girls in them.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference supported the complexities of the subject.
Even in infants and children, it has become common to see acne and genital hair.
"We need to be careful about how we identify the actual beginning of puberty," says Dr Lawrens Silverman, a pediatrician endocrinologist at Gourybe Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to seek guidance from their pediatrician to get an opinion on how to talk to their children.
"This may mean having a conversation ahead of the expected time," Caplovitz advised.
If you are calm, your child will usually answer well.
Pre-time development needs to be assured that even if it is premature, it is part of normal life.

Patek, who ran away as one of the most wanted individuals in South-East Asia for nearly 10 years, was sentenced to 20 years yesterday for his role in producing the explosive device used in the bombing.
He can be released in 15 years if granted parole.
Omar, 45, was found guilty of mass murder by attacking two nightclubs in the famous tourist area of Kuta, killing 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty of several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings at a church in Indonesia on the eve of Christmas in 2000.
Prosecutors had sought a life sentence, although they could even demand that this man, called the "devilatory person", infamous as a master man who made the bombs, had the death penalty.
The decision rekindled the painful memories of the woman living in Perth, June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters in a devastating attack by Patek and her co-conspirators a decade ago.
Stopping his tears, he said that Patek should have been given the death penalty.
I really feel that he should have been punished like other dreaded terrorists.
"She should be placed before the firing team," Ms. Courtin told AAP.
I have to live every day without my grandchildren and my daughters.
The club's name was destroyed after the explosion of a bomb loaded in a van parked outside the entire club, just 11 pm on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes, who was in the Paddies bar when the bombers exploded exactly 20 seconds ago a bagpack full of explosive material.
He went into a month-long coma as a result of the incident of this bombing and he "death" three times during his stay on life-saving equipment.
Mr. Hughes says Patek should have been punished the same as the three other members of the Jemmah Islamiah terror group responsible for the massacre - Amroji, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra - who were awarded the death penalty four years ago.
In fact, this person must be executed before someone else.
There is no reason to keep him alive.
After killing 202 people and injuring countless people, it is not enough to be sentenced to 20 years.
Patek is the last person to be punished out of the Bali bomb explosives.
He refrained from being caught for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011, in Abttabad, Pakistan, where the U.S. military killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden after less than four months.
During the trial, the FBI agent had submitted evidence that the report showed that the PATEC was in Pakistan to meet Bill Laden in an attempt to restore contact between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al Qaeda.
"She didn't surrender," says Ms. Courtine.
Even today, he is not really sad to hurt so many people.
The decision, this year, came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack, marked by celebrations in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year," Ms. Courtin said.
The petak can still appeal against his punishment.
When the hotel staff protested, they started beating him.
The son of the drunken MP, along with RK Singh, the younger brother of the hotel owner, started a scuffle.
Many other people were present there.
When he tried to catch the youth, he opened fire with a revolver.
The firing spread panic in the area.
The hotel staff caught hold of him and informed the police.
Hotel owner Munna Singh lodged a complaint against Anand Pandey, son of MP Gorakhnath Pandey, a resident of Berwa Paharpur in Koirana police station of Bhadohi district.
The police have arrested him and seized the revolver.
According to Handia inspector Ashok Saraswat, Munna Singh, a resident of Khabhor in Pratapgarh, runs a hotel called Raag Darbar on the national highway.
At around eight o'clock in the night, Anand Pandey reached the hotel and ordered food.
When there was a delay in the construction of the food, he started abusing, assaulting and firing.
Anand was under the influence of alcohol and also threatened to kill hotel workers.
The hotel is located near Bhiti village and is adjacent to Bhadohi district, the inspector said.
Cocaine addicted to cocane for giving secret information about police investigation to Mr. Big
42-year-old Basharat Ditta used to inform notorious criminal Neil Scarborough
The lawyer thought that people could find out about his confidential drug addiction
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
The defence's top counsel, who told Mr. Big about the main police investigation, as he feared that people would come to know about his drug his secret addiction, having been sentenced to three years in prison.
Barashat Ditta, 42, after a compromise on cocane addiction, provided sensitive confidential information to notorious criminal Neil Scarborough about his drug trafficking investigations.
This advocate, who was nicknamed "Baish", and who was praised by the criminals as a "top brief", was arrested from his home in 2011 after the police surveillance operation in Scarborough, which he represented in the previous Narcotics Trial.
Authorities had seen 32-year-old Scarborough placing three cocaine bags at a lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he went out for a law society dinner with his co-workers.
After the discovery of the cocaine particles in Ditta's hair, its wallet, and its credit card, the investigation revealed that the Ditta was a "regular user" of the drug addict.
During the eight-month period between January and August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two people on behalf of Scarborough and his associate.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police as part of the main investigation of the Heroine and Cocaine gangs operating in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merceside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
There were 32 other individuals who were jailed by police during multiple raids after Heroine and Cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds, and more than 200,000 pounds in cash seized.
The 42-year-old Ditta used to provide information to the criminals, because she feared that people would not know about her cocaine addiction.
Ditta, working in the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackbandard, was facing failure at Liverpool Crown Court today after two cases of obstructing the route of justice after a three-week trial at Liverpool Crown Court.
She had admitted to having cocaine at the earlier hearing.
The lawyer's bad time started when while investigating Scarborough, the police came to know that he was in regular contact with Ditta since February 2011.
The two spies chased the suspect and saw him coming to Ditta's house and keeping drugs with more than 60 per cent purity under the lawyer's bin in the black golf glove.
After being drugged, Scarboro was in regular phone contact with Ditta, who had gone out for dinner at the Blackern Rovers Football Stadium, Ewood Park.
On reaching home, the lawyer came to know that there was a drug and there was a dialogue between them nine times.
It was heard in the court that he was found to be a "regular user" of cocaine in the test when a category of drug clues were found on Ditta's hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but refused to use cocaine and said he was talking to the suspected dealer as he was his client and said that his discussion was a matter of "legal privilege."
During his arrest, Ditta tried to remove a lot of credit cards by taking out his wallet, but they were seized, and his hair sample was taken.
In the police interview, he said that he used to run the office from his workplace as well as his home, and his clients used to call him at his home for legal matters.
After the main persons arrested, the court hearing said that the detta used to call the prominent people of the drug supply chain, some of whom had earlier submitted the case.
Annie White, appearing for the prosecution, said: "The criminal advocate should be best aware of not breaking the law."
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as Criminal Advocate, engaging with his specific client much more.
We are not talking about the relationship of the common drug dealer, but about the dealer who is providing drugs to his lawyer.
Some of his conversations must have certainly been legal without any doubt, as he was a lawyer.
But he overtaked his limits of lawyer-client relationship.
As much as possible, he obstructed the police investigation so that they remained capable of continuing their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta was not respecting his profession, but insulting.
He made a lot of closeness to certain clients, especially from Scarborough, and allowed the agreement by his independence.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and claimed that: "If I were a corrupt lawyer, who I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I would not have waited for 15 hours, but I would have done this work immediately."
But after the hearing, Le Halsted, superintendent of Lancashire police, said that: "The time Mr. Ditta started receiving drugs from organized criminals, he converted himself from criminal to criminal."
Due to his cocaine addiction, he compromised and became very weak towards the objectives of the leading members of the organized crime groups, who used it to get important information related to police investigation.
Advocates must maintain the highest standard of integrity, and instill confidence and confidence in the people.
Mr. Ditta has cheated on this belief and has tried to escape under his garb.
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire examined Mr. Ditta, which also found him guilty of having cocaine and now obstructing the path of justice, reflecting our commitment to bring the perpetrators to court.
The case should act as a warning to the criminals that no person is out of reach of law.
We will find you and present you before the court.
Scarborough was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroine, cocaine and cannabis.
Twenty-five other members of the gang were sentenced to 153 years imprisonment for drug offences.
On her website, Ditta gave a question and answer session about herself, in which she said that her fantasy job would be to become a lawyer for a death-punished client in the US, Mohammad Ali's having a dinner guest, and inequality being an inspiration for his work.
Bombardier's profits decline as aircraft delivery, orders decline
Canada's airplane and train maker Bombardier Inc. reported a 15 percent drop in net profit on Thursday, as pressured by aircraft order and delivery lower than that in the third quarter in its train unit and as pressured by delivery.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not offer an update on issues to release any flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft or will complete its ambitious schedule of moving to commercial service from next September.
After the first flight of the test aircraft about another half a month ago, it has just been flown three times, the question arises whether the test phase is on the track or not.
The results fell below the forecast and the stock has been sent to the Toronto Stock Exchange for more than 8 percent sliding.
Cameron Dorsen, an analyst stock with National Bank Financial, had on Thursday lowered its rating from "met" to "field performance" of the stock is limited during the next one or two quarters.
"Weak aircraft deliveries were mostly anticipated, we are obviously disappointed with the margin performance in transportation," Doorsen said in a client note.
We will receive the new order for Bombardier CSeries as the progress of the flight testing program.
However, if any new orders are not announced in the coming months, there is a doubt that the market program will be sensured.
Bombardier expects the plane family to cut it down at the short end of the market dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft unveiled in March and was the first flight in September after the month of the delay.
Potential Buyers wait for the new Jetliner for flight testing results to validate the company's claims about fuel efficiency and potential cost savings but as the sure orders for CSeries are moderate to up to 177.
There are 403 full orders and commitment available with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Officer Pierre Boudoin believed that Bombardier would meet its 300 firm order targets from the time of first jet commercial use.
Officials assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was going on in accordance with the schedule.
"The test aircraft stayed on land for longer than predicted," Boudoin said in a conference call, adding this was also determined during the interval of the land test and software update aircraft.
Each manufacturer makes a schedule in a different way.
We had decided to make a first flight and have an updated period and said what we have done.
That will be all through the flight program.
The second remaining part of the five test aircraft is expected to fly in the coming weeks, with the following shortly after, the company said
Nevertheless, analysts believe that there are doubts customers can start operating a CSeries aircraft after their first flight in the first 12 months.
Bombardier has said that it will evaluate the Service (EIS) schedule in entry and will provide an update in the next few months.
"This slow pace of the flight test - although in the line with the internal schedule of Bombardier - reinforces our idea that the service in the entrance will be pushed to Q1/15," Dorsen said.
For the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million a year ago, or 8 cents per share, $172 million, or 9 cents per share.
The adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenue from $4.2 billion dollars to $4.1 billion drowned marginally.
According to analysts Thomson I/B/E/S, revenue earnings of 10 per share and $4.56 billion were expected to fetch revenue.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said that 45 aircraft were delivered during the quarter, below 57 a year ago
The pure order fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The backlog in the aerospace division was $32.9 billion on September 30, no change since December 31.
"Aerospace, the results were in line with our guidance, but the following order intake and overall market conditions were a disappointment," Boudoin said.
Aerospace revenues decline by 13 per cent at $2 billion.
Bombardier said that the world's largest train manufacturer, the division, had increased revenue by about 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The order backlog in the transport unit was around $32.6 billion of about 30 September, up from December 31.
Some of the larger contracts in the margins of the Transport Division were also influenced by the issues of execution.
Executives said the new guidance will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Among the shares of Bombardier, which announced the inclusion of Google Inc. Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pitchett Board, in mid-noon trading on Thursday, also lowering the C at $4.83 was a percentage of 8.5 percent.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the closest rival to the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier, reported a 10 percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
Intersex Kids Parents Can Choose Their Children’s Sex Unscheduled
Germany has become the first country in the European Union to recognise the third gender for children born with unclear genitalia.
Now newborn babies will not be specified in a conservative manner male or female.
According to the new law, parents do not need to declare gender for such children, this law allows them to declare gender undetermined or "unspecified" on a child's birth certificate.
The purpose of the new law is to reduce pressure on parents who may take decisions related to gender-specualization surgery for newborns in haste, and to fight discrimination against intersex children.
According to B.B.C., an intersex man said years later, "I am neither a man, nor woman."
I will remain injured, tainted by doctors.
It is estimated that every year, out of 2,000 children, there is a child who is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 conditions that come under examination of disorders of sexual development, a collective term used for abnormal chromosomes, genoculative (ovaries or testes), or abnormally developed sex.
Vallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identity is still not properly understood, but most experts in the United States believe that when gender-determination cannot be done, it is better to use the best information to specify the sex and observe the psychological and physical development of the child before performing surgery, if such a problem occurs.
New York City psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher who is a gender-identition expert, he said Germany's new law "something good thing."
Intersex children create moral confusion.
"Some people are in a life-surge-like situation that requires surgery, but this doesn't happen to most children," he said.
You can specify gender without surgery, and then see how identity develops.
The science of knowing how a gender will develop in a child is not very accurate.
No one can answer the right answer as to why this happens.
It's a kind of puzzle why people are gay.
The report filed before the European Commission in 2011 describes intersex people in a different form than transsexual or transgender people, because their condition is not related to gender but is related to its biological composition, which is neither clearly male nor female, but either of the two is clearly defined or not clearly defined.
These characteristics can show themselves secondary sexual characteristics, such as muscle weight, hair distribution, breast and length; primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals; or chromosome structure and hormones.
The report provides overviews of discrimination faced by intersex and transgender persons in the field of jobs, as well as harassment, violence and prejudice crimes.
There are now special camps for non-conformed sex boys.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adult persons to mark male, female or "third gender" on their official documents.
In June, the 52-year-old Australian Nory May-Velby became the world's first recognised "sexless" person after winning a legal appeal to hold a "unspecified" gender status for life-to-life.
According to the Interior Ministry, the German passport will also have a third specification for intersex persons in addition to M or F.
According to the news report on France 24, gender-related issues in neighboring France are still controversial.
In 2011, dozens of French law-makers from this strictly Catholic country have signed a petition to withdraw "generative doctrine" from school books.
The U.S. website Catholic Online has also opposed this law of Germany, saying, "While the world is going to a state where gender is a self-conselection option, not sexual activity, we are moving two more pillars of civilization in the opposite direction."
The mother of the newborn in Maryland also told the baby zone that she would love to see the children be specified gender at birth.
"Barring is very stressful without additional limitations, especially if you don't even know what your child's sex is," he said on the website about raising.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitalia were called Hermaphrodites (Bisexual), named after the beautiful Greek god who was bisexual.
And less than a decade ago, the medical world treated gender as a slate that was wiped out and then written.
But now many people are challenging the ethics of surgery, they are understanding that gender-identity is complex work, and sometimes there may be a mistake from physicians who do not know what children will feel about their gender specifications when they grow up.
"In the middle of the twentieth century, it was called an "psychiatric emergency," says Dresher.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you would call the surgeon.
The existing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals was presented by Dr. John Money of John Money of the University of John Hapkins, who considered gender good formurable.
He composed the term "gender identity" and argued that social and environmental signs - how parents raise a child - interacting with the child's genes and hormones determine whether to be identified as a male or as a woman.
But in a case of the year 1966, known as "John/Joan," their principles became controversial.
He advised the parents of a child whose gender had gone accidentally during the surgery, to give the child completely sterilized and get his testicles removed and raise it like a girl.
"Money presented that case as a successful case of the transitionar, but that didn't happen," Dresher said.
At the age of 15, the child changed himself back to a man and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, she committed suicide.
Dresher said that still some doctors are "adhering to the same pattern."
But with the advent of the Internet in the years after 1990, these sex surgeries began to appear "not happy with the result."
Similar was the case with Montana's 36-year-old writer Jim Bruce, who was born with the X.Y. male chromosome, but his genitals were vague.
The physicians clearly did not understand that his penis was small, or that his clitoris was big, but they were certain that he could never live a "satisfied life" as a man.
So shortly after her birth in 1976, Bruce's external organs and testicles were surgically removed and raised like a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," she told ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was very hard to ask.
At the age of 18, he was about to have vaginoplasty with him.
But feeling depressed and somewhat messy, she sought medical records.
This made him know the terrible truth.
I was stured at birth - and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with D.S.D., which prevented his body from making enough testosterone, due to which his genitals could not develop properly.
After knowing the truth, he became a male, he took a dose of testosterone and got his breasts removed.
He was left infertile due to surgery.
Today, he explains to people about intersex individuals in an organization called the Interface Project to make their perception of normalization.
But Annie Tamer-Matis, the executive director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, expresses concern that Germany's law "invites chippi and stigma."
"Many activists feel that Germany's law will prompt parents to make quick decisions and specify a child "undetermined," she says.
We are afraid that this will encourage interference.
We think that instead of waiting, it is a better process to specify the male or female gender.
But we don't know how the law will play its role, so we can only guess.
Tamer-Matis said her organization supports Australian law because "it allows adults to be recognized in the third gender."
"Adults about the legal sex should be able to make their own decisions," he said.
The German law deals with specifying it at the time of birth.
This is not a war fought by newborns at this time.
When they grow up, they can take decisions related to their body themselves.
But Dr. Erlin Baratz, a breast radiologist at Pittsburgh, whose daughter has a sexual development disorder, and who assist hundreds of others in the support group, said Germany's law would "give strength to both parents and children."
Baratji's daughter Katy was born with male chromosomes, but she had a D.S.D. called Full Androjan Insensitivity Certification.
Since there was a defect in her androgen receptor, female characteristics developed in Kati.
She has a vagina in her body but does not have a uterus or ovary.
Katy, 29, is now married and a resident in the Department of Child Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is infertile, she expects to become a mother through adoption or guestational surrogacy.
"This law allows parents not to take any decisions on their own in a hurry," Baratz said.
It provides them with proper understanding and time by some tests before writing ‘man’ or ‘woman’.
In this way, you stay fine - raise the child, love the child.
You have a lovely child and enjoy him.
We do not need to undergo a hasty surgery that cannot be returned.
"It brings the children into the decision-making process and frees the parents from the misery that motivates them because they don't believe they are doing well," he said.
Ultimately, the child will determine which gender he is more comfortable with - and that would be a great thing.
It enables children to make decisions for themselves.
Beautiful expression was presented in line with the story 'Another Dronacharya' showing harmony in the Dwapar era and today's circumstances.
It was shown that in today's context, in which shackles are bound by a guru to walk on the wrong path.

Clive Palmer claims P.M. Tony Abbott's interest struggle about the ancestral holiday plan
Billionaire M.P. Clive Palmer has said that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a struggle for the ancestral leave plan because his daughters can become pregnant, and take advantage of it.
Maharathi of the mining sector, who is in controversy over the payment of a $6 million carbon tax bill, has claimed, while he has attempted to answer questions about the conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be important in determining how to reduce carbon and mining taxes.
But Mr. Palmer has claimed that only ministers can have a conflict of interest, and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters can benefit personally from policies.
Mr. Palmer said, "In case of ancestral leave, they can have an important interest struggle, because if any of their daughters are pregnant, they will have a direct interest to get leave or not."
Two months after the election, the Election Commission has officially declared Mr. Palmer as the winner of the Sunshin Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes.
Mr. Palmer demanded restoration of election counting to take the process forward at a fast pace.
Tony Autt's daughters Fransage and Bridget.
Should the election result come two months after we voted?
"We should have a better system," he said.
Why can't we have a system in which we fill in our description on the computer, vote immediately and we have results at 6:30 in the evening.
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of pencils to mark the ballot papers.
This is because if a person does not like him, he can wipe it out?
In today's time, it seems to be absolutely absurd to use pencils.
The Election Commission is studying alternatives for electronic voting, and has recently issued a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his policies included the creation of an international airport for the Sunshine Coast, and he would "very seriously" take his new work.
Public office is for public service.
"We don't need any other awards other than the awards of history that we can serve the community at this critical time," he said.
George Kerevan: Euro disintegration gave the Scots the option
Another day, another story of fear of freedom
This time we have been warned that independent Scotland will be required to join as an independent travel zone across Europe as a condition of EU membership.
Passport control over Bervix and stories about the extent of barbed wire on the walls of the Hadrian.
The truth is that the Strathclide paper described the potential economic benefits of independent movement with the rest of Europe, although predictably - not described it in the headlines.
No one described that EU members spend most of their time changing their formal rules as per their requirement.
Since Scotland is no longer the Schengen region, Brussels will actually be cheaper discounts for non-compliance Brussels in exchange for achieving whatever one wants from Scotland.
So, then, the story.
And the thing that has been stuck for such a long time has solidified. First of all, I heard the baseless news "Freedom means passport control" about 40 years ago.
However, the interesting point in recounting this interesting old story was lost.
Why should independent Scotland expect Europe to bid for Europe anyway?
Why should London's Yoke be bought and sold for Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great, post-war planning to organize Europe has finally stopped.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe has officially died.
Throughout the EU, parties dedicated to opposing the EU or closing the euro in the form of similar currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptil Alternatives for Germany party - founded this year - suddenly came to know about fifty million votes in the September federal election, and thus effectively excluded the Free Democrats (equivalence to our own lib dems) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to build federal Europe.
But the current economic crisis proved to be radical changer.
Many people have to think that project Europe has gone far away due to the harsh rules imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, the barriers imposed on national economies through complying with the same currency.
The euro crisis did not play a lot of role in the excessive budget deficit of national governments - that was only true in the case of Greece.
Rather, the euro system stabilized the currency exchange rate in favor of its members German exporters - something that German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of domestic currency devaluation, Southern Europe finds itself in an underlying loss of productivity compared to Germany.
The only solution is to reduce salaries and public expenditures - which has been encouraged by Berlin.
The European productivity is deeper than the current budget and currency problems.
To provide a discount to French and German energy firms at consumer expenditures - as a result of the "green" energy policies imposed by Brussels, European industries pay twice as much for electricity and four times for gas than the United Nations.
This is the paralyzing cost loss, which we have already seen in Grangemouth.
Even to freeze all salaries in the world, the European petrochemicals cannot save the industry from being affected by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, there is a feeling of revolt among the people, especially in France, which was once a major fan of the EU.
After the war, French top politicians saw the EU as a measure to keep Germany under control, and Paris as a way to provide billing at par with the Wansigton in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for political legitimacy, and it has implemented its own economic policies on Europe, which has led to the French economy swaying.
Result: Marine Lee Pen's right-wing, the anti-EU National Front has won by pushing the ruling Socialist to third place in the recent by-election.
At this time the front is the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote - this is the warning for the British Labour that they cannot assume that the dissolution to the left, will automatically benefit for the right.
What is Lee Pen doing with his newly found fame in the midst of French whites, working class?
The party wants to use next year's EU elections to be formed in the European Parliament to form an anti-EU, anti-sulparity anti-cossional faction.
If, as is quite possible, this type of faction can affect the European Parliament for the first time if the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections.
My point of view is: Soon the confluence of anti-EU and anti-coermonial anti-record in Europe will end the euro.
The euro will not end completely, but it will reach back to some form like the retail "( Europe of the sovereign) nations" that will be supported by General de Gaull.
Germany and some of its retainer economies can sustain the euro, but France and Southern Europe will restart their currencies.
I expect the U.K. to keep himself away from this project in the hope of increasing closeness with the U.S.
However, Vansigton's growing interest in the Pacific indicates that Britain will be left in the cold Atlantic.
What will happen to Scotland?
We can choose to remain the territory of Little England (necessarily).
Or we can protect our own economic interests - including telling Berlin and Brussels to separate at the right time.
I think Scotland can perform better-execution in the loose European system, provided we keep our own currency.
It will be easier for non-feder nations to work together with other common-minded countries in Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider maintaining our economic freedom by following the path of the Norway.
The SNP government in Scotland - mentioningly - has been the most successful anti-fugal political campaign in Europe, which won a surprising majority in 2011 on the basis of the proposed (and implemented) cuts proposed by Labour Chancellor Alastair Darling and then on the basis of the Tory-Lib Dame alliance.
It would be absurd for Scotland to vote for independence at this time, as it will have to accept the rules of economy imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
So you used to have travel agents of the last century, thank you to the Internet?
The flight centre is taking this trend forward.
The company has increased its full-year profit forecast, and is expecting a record profit from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom.
The travel company expects that the underlying profit of the previous year will be between $325 million to $340 million, compared to the previous forecast between $305 million and $315 million.
If the target is achieved as per the present guidance, it will increase by 12 to 17 per cent in the record $290.4 million profit achieved in 2011/12.
Managing Director Graham Turner said the flight center has made a profit of 8 per cent in the first half, and made a good start in its second half, especially in Australia and the U.K. in non-business travel.
"So far, 10 of our countries are profitable, and many countries are on the path of full-year income before interest and tax contributions," he said.
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom, which are usually our most profitable centers.
The holiday business has gained momentum in the second half in Australia, which completes the shortfall of a slightly weaker domestic corporate travel market.
Similarly, in the UK, the flight center's holiday business performed well, while corporate clients were spending less.

Birds were released back into the wilderness by air transport to protect from the North Sea Rig
The bird found sick on the North Sea Oil Rig has been released back from the coast into the forest by air transport.
The bird, called Water Rail, was sent to Aberdeen by helicopter before the Scottish SPCA recovered back to his rescue centre at Alloa.
Centre manager Colin Seddon reported: "This water rail was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe, which was hit by strong winds over the North Sea."
It seems that this bird was tired and took refuge on the oil rig.
He further explained: "It was unable to fly again so we were approached for help."
The water train had become healthy and fit before it was released.
India's biggest businessman Mukesh Ambani's wife Nita Ambani is celebrating her 50th birthday on 1 November 2013.
Nita is celebrating her birthday not in Mumbai but in Jodhpur.
He organised a large party on the occasion.
On the late evening of October 31, many big stars were seen taking a flight to Jodhpur at the Mumbai airport.
The stars include Karisma Kapoor, Geeta Basra, Vinod Khanna and his wife Kavita Khanna, Abhishek Kapoor, Anu Malik, Shekhar Kapoor, Raj Kumar Hirani, Rakesh Om Prakash Mehra, Rahul Bose, etc.
Obviously, when such a big name will join the party, you can guess how big this Jalsa will be.
According to this report, the UPA government has spent Rs 8.5 crore in the last four years to celebrate the birth anniversary of Sardar Patel.
In contrast to Modi's claims, during the NDA regime (between 1999 and 2004) Atal Bihari Vajpayee was the prime minister, when no advertisement was issued by the government over Patel for two consecutive years (2001-2002).
Laying the foundation stone of Sardar Patel's 182-metre tall Statue of Unity in Gujarat's Kevadia on Thursday, Modi said, "There was no advertisement on the occasion of Sardar Patel's birth anniversary earlier.
While the DAVP records show that the UPA has spent Rs 30 lakh in 2009-10, Rs 4.10 crore in 2010-11, Rs 2.7 crore in 2011-12 and Rs 1.4 crore in 2012-13 on advertisements of Sardar Patel
When Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari was asked about Modi's claims, he said the BJP's PM candidates do not talk on the basis of facts.
The UPA could not bring any advertisement on Patel in 2008.
Tiwari said that this was due to the economic slowdown that year.
However, the amount spent on Sardar Patel's advertisements is much less than the amount spent on the birth and death anniversary of the Nehru-Gandhi family members every year.
The DAVP spent Rs 33 crore for the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, Rs 21 crore for former PM Rajiv Gandhi, Rs 14.5 crore for Indira Gandhi and Rs 9.38 crore for Jawaharlal Nehru.
When asked about the difference, Manish Tewari said, "It should not be seen from the point of view of expenditure on advertising.
Because the price of advertising depends on many things, including the size of the advertisement or the rate of advertising for that year, etc.
The real thing is that it shows our dedication, which the people who oppose are trying to handle the legacy of a great leader without knowing about it.
On the occasion, a cultural programme was also presented on the occasion.
The programme was organised by the committee at Gandhi Park on Friday morning.
Mayor Vinod Chamoli along with the office-bearers of the committee garlanded the statue of martyr Kesari Chand.
Former SP state president Vinod Barthwal was the chief guest and former MLA Munna Singh Chauhan was the chief guest.
On behalf of Veer Sukh Kala Manch Jaunsar, 'Kesari Teri Yaad Main Kashi Bhuluni, Jiydei Teri Mengeon Beera Kashi Muttuni', 'Veer Kesari Chand Ji Ki Harut', 'Jaunsar's adorable deity Mahasu Dev Ki Vandana' were presented on behalf of Jaunsar.
The Chief Guest highlighted the life of Veer Shaheed Kesari Chand and apprised the people of his contribution in the freedom struggle.
The speakers called upon all the people present in the programme to become determined and patriotic like Shaheed Kesari Chand.
On this occasion Radha Mohan Prasad, Vijay Sinha, Rajesh Kumar, Shivnath Nandi and others were present.
Congress leader Chadveer Hooda held public relations at Sector 21 and village Maheshpur on Friday.
During this time, people were invited to the rally and also assigned responsibilities.
Chadvir has also fixed the duties of the workers.
Hooda said that crores of rupees have been spent by Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the district.
Haryana Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda has done development work of Rs 15 crore in the last four years in the panchayats of Barwala block.
Hooda said that on the call of the Chief Minister, there is a lot of enthusiasm among the party workers about this rally and this rally will be strengthened by all the rallies so far and it will also raise the stature of Haryana politics in the whole country.
Chadvir said that the Chief Minister will also crown Hooda for the third time for the people of the state.
Supreme Court backs Obama healthcare law
As a major victory for the Obama administration, the U.S. Supreme Court today declared healthcare law constitutional in the name of Barack Obama.
By 5-4 votes, the judges ruled in favour of separate orders of the Patient Safety and Affordable Care Act - under which citizens will be required to buy or punish health insurance before the year 2014, that it was constitutional under the government's power to impose taxes.
Chief Justice John Robert supported four other liberal members of the court, while the other judges Scalia, Thauss, Elito and Kennedy disagreed.
The court also endorsed the remaining articles of the 2700-page law, and said that the condition of the healthcare law is not illegal, whether the states would increase the Medicaid eligibility or all the federal Medicaid funding, not an illegal victim.
The petition was filed by 26 states, and the National Independent Business Federation, to prevent the law.
The law was opposed by all prominent Republican presidential candidates during the initial session of 2012, including project nominee Mitt Roomney.
Australian woman appeals against Thai imprisonment period
A 21-year-old Sydney woman has been sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly accusing her of assaulting a taxi driver, she has filed an appeal against the decision and granted bail.
On June 15, the Fucket Provincial Court found Stevie Rochelle Bomford guilty of making false allegations against Thai police, alleging that on the morning of Sunday, June 10, a local taxi driver, along with two other persons, had attempted to stop him.
But later CCTV footage showed that she had safely returned to the hotel after separating from her Australian boy friend.
On questioning by the police for two days by the Phuket police, he confessed to fabricating the story.
He was kept in the local police cell before the court heard the case.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days imprisonment at a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of an adult woman prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunx, who has requested the Foreign Affairs Department in Canberra to assist her daughter.
Tunx told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the entire family was "extremely concerned" about their daughter's care and they want to call her back to Australia.
"Doubtly, this has been a worrying time for us, but we hope he'll be back home as soon as possible," Tunx said.
Bamfod has filed an appeal against the penal order, and has been granted bail on 50,000.
Reports in Australia said she was holidaying in southern Thailand at a holiday.
The legal sources in Thailand said that the case of Bamford was being contested by a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that as a result of the appeal, the court could increase his penal order to two years and force him to stay in the adult prison.
After the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michael Smith in Phuket, Thailand can also be abused in an attempt to improve its poor tourist image.
Snow Dane ready to "cooperation" with Germany on American vigilance
Edward Snow Den, the U.S. intelligence informer, has declared that the German Parliament is ready to travel to Berlin to give evidence if the US National Security Agency and its director Kith Alexander fail to respond about his activities.
German M.P. Hans Christian Straw Belle, met Mr. Snow Dane in Russia on Thursday, where he has been granted asylum to talk about testimony in Germany.
The MP, in a letter submitted by Mr. Snow Dane to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: "Although the outcome of my efforts is evidence-proven positive, my government accepts dissent as the party - changed, and provides no defense that is an attempt to criminalize political speech with allegations of hooliganism."
However, it has not been a crime to tell the truth.
In the letter, Mr. Snow Dane said he believed that he could persuade the US government to abandon criminal charges against him.
The charge filed by the US Department of Justice is involved in the theft of intelligence and government property.
Hans Peter Frederick, the minister of German internal affairs, told Zeit online: "If Mr. Snow Den has been ready to talk to the German authorities, we have to find ways to make it possible."
Relations between the US and Germany have come under pressure after the NSA claimed that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone bugged.
Thomas Operman, the lawmakers who are the chairman of the parliamentary committee, oversee intelligence. If there was an opportunity to hear Mr. Snow Dane as a witness "without completely ruining relations with America and bringing him into danger," it should still be taken.
Sristraw Brelle, a parliamentarian from Germany's Green Party, published a picture of himself with Mr. Snow Dane on Twitter feed.
He said he was on his visit to Russia with two German journalists.
According to the former NSA contractor lawyer, Snow Den is not able to go back to Russia if he left Russia.
If Snow Danes testifies in Germany he would be "safe" there which would require assurances, the lawmaker said.
Mr. Snow Dane said in his letter that he had "to face fearless and sustained campaigns" for him was forced to leave home.
However, he said that they are happy and overwhelmed by the world's broad responses" to their work of political expression."
World citizens, as well as higher officials, have assessed the revelation of an irresponsible system of comprehensive monitoring of a public service.
The letter extends a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities "when the problems of the humanitarian situation have been resolved."
Killing mosquitoes is going to be expensive to avoid diseases like dengue, malaria, filariasis.
The state government is going to triple the tax on rapeants, mats, liquids used in killing mosquitoes.
The proposal to increase the tax will be placed before the Cabinet soon.
The government, which is facing a financial crisis, is exploring all possible ways to increase earnings these days.
Urban Development Minister Mohammad Azam Khan has been formed to look into the financial health of the government.
According to sources, in the recent resource committee meeting, out of several proposals to increase tax, the committee rejected them, whose implementation would have had a direct impact on the general public.
However, the committee has given its nod to the proposal to increase the tax on mosquito-killing rapelants, coils, mats and liquids.
They are proposed to triple the tax.
At present, there is a four per cent VAT and one per cent additional tax.
Now, 12.50 per cent VAT and 1.50 per cent additional tax are proposed on them.
The government is expected to generate additional revenue of Rs 14 crore from this.
Although the Commerce Tax Department has been in favour of increasing tax revenue from five per cent to 14 per cent on tendu leaves, the Financial Resources Committee has rejected the proposal.
The committee believes that tendu leaf is used to make the beedi that the lower strata people drink.
Similarly, the committee has not given the green signal to increase the tax on electric goods like transmission wires etc.
The committee has also not accepted the proposal to levy green tax on the renewal of commercial vehicles.
The hearing on the bail plea of former military ruler General Pervez Musharraf in the murder of a cleric of the Lal Masjid has been postponed till November 4th.
The next hearing of the case against Musharraf will be on November 11.
In 2007, cleric Ghazi Abdul Rashid was killed in a military operation against the radicals hiding in the Lal Masjid.
The police have already given a big relief by putting Musharraf innocent in this case.
According to police, the then President Musharraf was not directly involved in the killing of the cleric.
Islamabad: Additional District and Sessions Judge (ADSJ) Wajid Ali Musharraf is hearing the bail plea of Islamabad.
During the hearing, Tariq Asad, a representative of the Lal Masjid Shuhda Foundation and the complainant's lawyer, alleged that the police have destroyed all the evidence to prove Musharraf innocent.
The lawyer sought some time from the court to produce more evidence in the case.
The court then deferred the hearing on Musharraf's bail plea till November 4th.
Gazprom's Alexei Miller calls the pipeline a new phase beginning in Bulgaria
The head of the Gazprom said that the construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria has marked the bottom of Europe's largest energy projects.
“A historic event has happened today: Construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, which is the largest scale and important project in Europe,” said Alexey Miller, president of Gazprom, in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a core element of energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream will provide variety in Russia's export routes in Europe.
Officials said that a dispute related to the contract between Gazprom's counterpart and Gazprom in Ukraine, where the majority of Russia's gas is for Europe, presents a risk to traditional routes.
Miller said a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means the end of the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries "forever."
After the entire project is operational in 2015, Bulgarian customers will receive gas at discounted rates from the South Stream.
Gajprom said construction should start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline has been designed for the annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Report: Consideration of Biden dumping Obama campaign for Hillary Clinton.
According to the New York Times, close advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered Hillary Clinton in place of Biden for the vice president's post of Tickets for 2012.
The most notable explosion in the revelation is the heavy anticipated by Mark Halperin and John Helemon's 2012 campaign Tome, "Double Down: Game Change 2012."
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers held "wide-group-sessions and polling in late 2011" to find out what dumping Biden could help in Obama's falling hope of a re-election.
According to Times National Political Corresporent Jonathan Martin, the book explains the complete information that the effort in the campaign of the chief officers and the head of the former White House staff for the name of the White House, to know what the impact of the former state secretary Clinton from the vice president to the vice president is on the pole.
The potential switch was a very safe secret within the Chicago Expedition infrastructure and inside the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president – including Dale, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Oxford and David Palouffe - were under consideration.
"Double Down" claims that Dala tried to change Biden despite his personal rapport, eventually before making a decision, when his information was telling that Clinton's ticket would not improve Obama's situation.
In an interview with Martin, Dal has confirmed that the administration had actually considered Clinton's place with Biden.
"I said, keeping the whole scene in mind, and one of them, it was," Dali said to the newspaper.
You remember that at that time the presidence was in danger, so we were in such a situation, "What else will we do?"
While Dale described the research as "precaution", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that the election campaign again made significant investments to find out how much dividend it would give when the pole is.
"The campaigns don't spend on voting and focused groups like money until they're seriously considering something," Martin said on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was looking for change.
Martin told CNN that he asked Dal if his boss knew about the possible change.
While Dale said he "don't think the president was aware of the possible change", the former chief of staff believed that it was "possible" that Obama knew it.
"Double Down" Definitely: Will it not answer if a political inquiry reached Obama's desk? Martin told more.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought that Obama was not aware of Biden dumping ticket research.
"Possibly," Martin said.
Today he will meet the families of those killed in a rally in Patna last Sunday.
A week after the blast, tight security arrangements have been made everywhere in view of Narendra Modi's visit to Patna again.
The police conducted a thorough investigation into the route of Modi's visit and the venues of the meeting.
The police will keep an eye on the people who attend the meetings.
The Gujarat Police Force, NSGIB and the state police will keep an eye on security.
Modi's security will be tightened.
Meanwhile, questions have also been raised about the BJP's Aste Kalash Yatra taken out of the people killed in the Patna blast.
Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has alleged that the BJP was trying to vitiate the atmosphere.
The Congress has re-elected all the old MLAs.
The list includes 6 old and 2 new faces.
Among the new faces, Nirmala Sapre from Bina assembly constituency in Sagar district and Pratap Singh Lodhi from Jabera assembly constituency in Damoh district have been given a chance.
Three MLAs from Sagar, two from Tikamgarh and one from Chhatarpur have been given tickets again.
Govindsinh Rajput has been fielded from Surkhi, Arunodaya Choubey from Khurai and Narayan Prajapati from Banda.
In Tikamgarh, Yadavendra Singh and Brijendra Singh Rathore from Prithvipur and Vikram Singh Nati Raja from Raj Nagar in Chhatarpur have been given tickets.
All of them are sitting MLAs in these areas.
After the first list of the BJP and the Congress, the two parties will face a new face in Bina.
BJP's Mahesh Rai and Congress' Nirmala Sapre are at loggerheads.
In Tikamgarh's Prithvipur, sitting Congress MLA Brijendra-Singh Rathore will face former minister late Sunil Nayak's wife Anita Nayak.
BJP's Ramakrishna Kusmaria will challenge the sitting MLA Vikram Singh Nati Raja of Rajnagar.
BJP MP Bhupendra Singh and MLA from Khurai Arunodaya Choubey.
BJP's young leader Parul Sahu is pitted against Surkhi MLA Govind Rajput.
The adaptation of Dennis Dederott's novel by Giloum Nickleux has a description of the best production design and time period, but it's much more than it should have been.
The novel, which depicts the time of 1760, tells the tragic story of the young Raees named Suzanne, which his family members send the convent.
When she rebels, she faces extreme cruelty at the hands of the self-wretched Mother Superior, and becomes an object of erotic attraction to another.
This movie never goes into sexuality or sensation - and that's the problem.
Due to the strong seriousness of the narrative, there is also a risk for the audience to become a boring film.
Own railways found in U.S.-Mexico drug tunnel
One of the most complex drug trafficking tunnels between the USA and Mexico has been found to have its own lighting, ventilation, and electric rail system.
The U.S. authorities have described the four-feet-time three-foot tunnel as one of the most complex secretive routes ever discovered.
The tunnel is equivalent to the crooked length of about six football pitches, which connects the warehouse near Tijuana, Mexico, and the San Diego, the U.S.A.
The area is full of similar warehouses, which makes it easy to hide the truck being drug-filled.
Officials said it was closed before any drug passed through the tunnel.
According to the court records, the authorities have seized eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 327 pond cocaine in connection with the discovery of the tunnel.
Three persons, who were told by the authorities that they were acting as drivers, were charged with keeping marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of distributing.
If convicted, he can be sentenced to 10 years imprisonment to life imprisonment.
Smugglers in Nogles, Arizona, take advantage of huge underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major route discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered after the marijuana crop of central Mexico in October, which presents a capable challenge of drug mafia groups on how to rapidly transport the product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a route of about 700 yards equipped with a rail track, which stretched from the kitchen of a house in Tijuana to the San Diego warehouses.
A meeting of the two was held at a Cabinet meeting.
When the meeting was over, Singh praised the Chief Minister's speech for his retaliatory attack on Narendra Modi at the Chintan Shivir.
He also said that he had no other sense in his mind.
They want the party to be strong.
New challenges should be faced.
The Chief Minister's face was also the same that he took Singh's speech in a positive manner.
Singh had urged the Chief Minister to pay respects to the workers at the Chintan Shivir and save them from alleged harassment of officers.
However, he had also spoken that he was ready for dismissal from the Cabinet to make his point.
However, after the opinion that emerged in the Chintan Shivir, there is a possibility of a fresh idea in the matter of appointing workers in government posts.
State JD(U) president Vashisht Narayan Singh had said that the nomination of workers in the 20-point committee would be announced soon.
His indication was also that the list is almost ready.
It is being reported that now Chief Minister Nitish Kumar himself will visit the list from his level.
They will also examine whether the opinion of MLAs and MPs has been taken in the making list.
If needed, the list will be changed on a large scale to give space to old and committed workers.
The legislators and MPs have alleged that their opinion was not taken in making the list of nominations.
The names of people who came from other parties much later have been included in the list, while many important workers active since the days of the Samata Party have been neglected.
Halloween 2013: by numbers
When I was young, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay quiet late and play dress up for the neighborhood.
Today, I'm more than a covet
I didn't even sign in to give candy out of my apartment for the last two years and probably wouldn't be this year.
But statistics show that I am a black sheep when Halloween comes

This year, everyone is angry with sexy inanimate objects.
Women do not have to do prostitution; because they are also sexy food like pizza, humbergers and carrots.
For men, I hope that many zombies, and thank you, the unfacting space of the dead, will make our Instagram feeds for the males this year.
According to Google, the most searched outfits will be zombies, buttmons, robbers and chutes.
I think there is no harm in being traditional.
Last year, we dressed dogs and we were not alone with unspeakable.
According to the NRF, the American people will literally spend $330 million for pet costumes.
It is ironic that many hotdogs are with dogs.
When it comes to Candy, we don't look around.

Hairshi Bars, Lollipop, Milk Duds, Twisters and Clark Bar are around 600 million pounds.

That is about 9 billion personal kernels of Mecca.
This is a mystery. Yet to solve
There is nothing more than the Tattmamayi Halloween ghosts.
They are the best name, "The panic behind the wall (which is really a prison), "Chikh-o-Chikh" and were like "House of Shock."
According to the American power, in fact, there is 1200 officially approved ghost houses, which generate 500 million revenues in the United States. And the terrible good pictures that your friend puts on Facebook and the man who likes and comments on you Nice Face.
Finally, let's talk about pumpkin.
Charlie Brown introduced the great pumpkin when we were kids, and a jack-o-lantern carving is like a Christmas tree decorating - it's something we've done since we were little.
For us, fortunately, "Baby in a pumpkin trend" started last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up by carving these guards and not being in awe of being with them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year, Americans will spend around $106 million on pumpkins,
Jack-O-the-slowly wither lanterns on their front porch probably from Illinois, which grew from 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you're looking for additional loans, try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin up, in Phone Tim and Susan Matisdas Napa, and try to engrave their 2,032 pounds of pumpkin above.
Some people are born with silver spoons, some make life ideal with their hard work and people take inspiration from them.
One such name is the name of late Dhirubhai Ambani.
Dhirubhai Ambani, the third son of Hirachand Gowardhandas Ambani, was born on December 28, 1932, in a school in a small village in Gujarat.
Of the five siblings, Dhirubhai was third.
The five children of the family include Ramnikalal, Natwar Lal, Dhirubhai and two sisters Trilochana and Jasumati.
Due to financial constraints, Dhirubhai had to drop out of school only after high school.
Dhirubhai had started helping the house financially in childhood.
At this time, they used to set up a bhajiye shop near Girnar, the income of the shop was limited on the number of tourists coming here.
Talking about Dhirubhai's first job, in 1949, he arrived in the city of Aden in Yemen by a ship named Kabota at the age of 17.
Here his elder brother Ramnikalal had made all the arrangements for him, so he did not have any problem in getting a job abroad.
But there was something else going on in Dhirubhai's mind.
So in 1954, he returned to Watan.
In 1955, he reached Mumbai to try his luck by keeping Rs 500 in his pocket.
And that's where his business journey started.
From here, Dhirubhai Ambani took such steps that he never looked back again.
His name became famous not only in the country but also abroad.
Dhirubhai Ambani left the world on July 6, 2002.
At present, he was the owner of Rs 62000 crore.
His sons Mukesh Ambani and Anil Ambani are currently in charge of the Sultanate.
Like his father, today the name of these two brothers is also one of the international level businessmen.
Who doesn't know the Ambani family today?
Dhirubhai, Kokilaben, two sons Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their wives Nita Ambani and Tina Ambani.
Is the upper class of Europe ready to do business with Britain?
In April, Business for Britain was launched and a pledge was taken to bring the business together and determine what changes we wanted to see in our relationship with the U.K.'s employment and prosperity builder E.U.
For that, we conducted the largest and most detailed survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they had about Britain's business with the EU.
U-Gov took the views of 1000 business leaders, who are representatives of the UK's commercial size, regions and places.
The findings of this survey can be surprising to many people.
We found that a large part of businessmen now want to export outside of Europe, and focus on countries that are becoming modern and growing, while EU member countries are becoming sedentary.
They want the government to prioritize new trade relations with countries like China, India and Brazil and not to engage in the long-term and difficult process of reforming the secret institutions of the EU.
When asked about specific policy areas ranging from monopoly regulation to product law, most business leaders believed that the control of these decisive qualifications should come back to Westminster.
The common dissatisfaction about the single market could be very easily seen, with businessmen saying that the price of Brussels regulation is far greater than the benefits of becoming part of Europe's trading sector - even 40 percent of the giant businessmen who were traditionally favoring European companies agreed to this.
Finally and most clearly, our survey of business leaders found that, a large part clearly wants Britain to move on the path of trade-based relationship and treaty change rather than politics with the EU.
This conclusion, which was observed in the levels of major business groups, showed that businessmen are motivating towards a "meaningful change" that would give the U.K. its lost power back.
It is a very high price - the issue of treaty change for Britain and getting a better deal changed the 16 percent vote in favour of staying in the EU in the collection of votes.
The Prime Minister should not be in doubt: This survey is that UK businessmen support their plan to negotiate on the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also demonstrated that businessmen expect to retalize the current balance of power in favour of the U.K. by making a meaningful change.
A better deal is possible for British businesses, and it is becoming imperative very fast, as the eurozone is moving towards the ecosystem and the fiscal union.
Priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as the findings of our survey show that for businessmen it means a new focus on trade and a fundamental change in the regulation methodology of Brussels.
Even after the post-mortem, the cause of death could not be lifted due to the actual cause of death.
The forest department, giving a befitting reply in this regard, prima facie, is describing the death of the tigress as natural.

Kenya's press outraged over controversial media law
"This is a frightening place, and it is legitimate to ask: what is the Parliament to take away the independence of the judiciary in tomorrow?"
"This law is cruel and very punitive, and we reject it," said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group, Kenya's most prestigious independent radio station and news website CapitalFM.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it is part of the government" and said that banning content and advertising would harm Kenya's place in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we appeal to him to reject the Bill and send back the MPs," he said.
According to The Star newspaper, the new bill will provide "strict control over the media" to the government, while The Standard said that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have been "a major blow to" and termed the bill as cruel.
The bill is being passed as one of the measures to strengthen national security after the attack by an Islamic gunman in the Westgate shopping mall in September.
Kenya's media had broadcast the security camera footage of the squads sent to the attack site, showing them so purposely looting the mall, which made the authorities angry with Kenya's media.
Police chief David Kimayo had summoned two journalists and mediapersons for questioning, though the summons was withdrawn after the media created a ruckus.
Under the new Bill, media companies can be fined 2 crore Kenyan shillings and 10 lakh Kenyan shillings to different journalists and in addition to this, the additional risk of "removing from the list" or non-accreditation of official press recognition will be different.
In case of non-payment of penalty, the Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of the violator.
According to the Daily Nation, "A penalty is enough to shake the foundations of most FM stations."
It also said that these measures can have destructive effects on what Kenya is described as a "living blogosphere."
By closing the media, politicians know that they can do their own thing.
Nation's journalist Mutuma Matthew Kenyane describes the media as a major source of control and balance in public life, writing "No one will ever know."
"If left to politicians, they will bankrupt the country and take us back to the age of hunting and depositing," he wrote.
In the past, Kenyan lawmakers have faced people's anger.
In May he voted in favour of rejecting the deducts ordered by the National Pay Commission, and restored tax-free body wages, about 532,000 shillings per month, which is considered to be among the world's highest.
Obama's healthcare proposal was withdrawn.
Amid a shower of criticism, President Obama withdrew his often-reiterating misleading promise yesterday that "you can continue to do if you like your health plan."
With millions of people receiving cancellation information from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president for misleading American citizens in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama changed his message.
"A lot of people who have health insurance, and that's useful, they can continue to do it," he said in a speech in Boston.
Addressing the cancellations, Obama has graced purchasing new coverage in the market from American citizens who receive these information.
Most people will be able to get a better deal, a comprehensive healthcare plan at a cheaper one than the same amount of money or even the proposed.
"You will get a better deal.
The administration has said that it should come as no wonder that 5 per cent of the population who buy insurance with their own money may be bound to change their plans as their coverage does not conform to the standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
In a statement before the Home Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington, Sebelius said that "I'll directly tell these American citizens" you deserve better than this.
Cebelius, who is taking responsibility for the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the online market launch since October has been "unfortunate."
He said, "I am as frustrated and angry as other people."
I want to get your trust again.
After a scathing attack with the Republicans, Sebelius said this angrilyate to a fellow sitting behind him at the House hearing yesterday, which a mic caught. Billy Long, R-Mo about whether he would need to be enrolled in Obamacare.
In a more than three-hour-long hearing, Long repeatedly asked Cebelius why the "arrator" of the Affordable Care Act has not voluntarily abandoned government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through Healthcare.gov, which she is now selling to millions of Americans.

The parents of a Georgian teenager who died in an unabated accident believe that his son was killed
A Georgian teenager whose dead body was found wrapped in a resting mat in her high school gym, believes her son was murdered, the family's lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendric Johnson of Valdosta, G.A., was found trapped in a mat in a straight-standing mat behind Bleachers inside his high school gym on January 11.
Investigators from the Landdes County Sheriff concluded that Johnson died in an unaccounted accident, but the family of the 17-year-old boy denied it.
Advocate Benjamin Krump, who submitted to Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told Fox News.com that "he fully believes that his son has been murdered".
He does not have any faith in death in the manner described by the sheriff.
"He believes this is beyond the logic of physical law and general intelligence," Krump said.
They think that this conclusion is an excuse for the safety of the person or people responsible for the death of their son.
He said that "he had sent his son to school with a book-back, and he returned to a body bag"
U.S. Advocate General Michael Mulley said on Thursday that he was conducting a formal investigation into Johnson's death, noting that a lot of important questions are unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was he killed for a crime?
Murray said this at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts, wherever they take us.
My aim is to bring out the truth.
"My view is that environmental reasons exist for a formal investigation," he said.
Moure told the reporter that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson's death occurred as a result of "determinational reception."
According to Moore, however, a different cause of death was discovered in a second autopsy."
"There are many questions that should be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moure also said that if he finds enough evidence to summon a criminal or to investigate civil rights in the case of Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to do it.
On contacting on Thursday, the representative was not immediately available for comment from the office of the Lawdes County Sheriff.
On Wednesday, the Southern Georgia judge ordered the authorities to release all surveillance videos reviewed by investigators.
The boy's parents say they hope to get some indications from the video footage of how he died.
Addressing a rally, Modi said, "You look at the speeches of Congress or UPA leaders in the last two months, then you will find that they do not talk about what they have done."
"The Congress has become so arrogant that it does not answer the questions of the media," he said.
Manmohan Singh is the Prime Minister and his government, yet he needs a reply from Modi.
It is your duty to answer to the people.
Modi was apparently replying to Sibal, who told reporters in Delhi that Modi wants an environment with his control where he gives his speech and does not talk to reporters to avoid questions.
Sibal also challenged Modi to face-to-face debate.
"I promise the people of the country that when the BJP forms the government in 2014, we will present a report to the people every year," Modi said.

Blair says he wants to return to the UK
Tony Blair said he would like to be the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom again - but he believes that there is no possibility of a comeback.
In a night interview on the occasion of his farewell from the Prime Minister's Office, 59-year-old Blair expressed his views on various domestic policies.
After stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as a leader, Mr. Blair largely refrained from discussing British politics, Mr. Blair, while restricting most of his comments to his role of representative of peacekeepers of the Middle East Group.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr. Blair was presented by London's Evening Standard newspaper, saying: "Yes, of course, but this is unlikely to happen, so..."
He urged the leaders not to ignore the business community after the financial crisis.

Glow-in-Di- Like Dark Ice Cream?
A British entrepreneur has made the world's first glow-in--dire ice cream - using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis has taken the full advantage of the sea animal to develop the best breakfast.
The idea came after reading a research paper on jellyfish and Chinese confident scientists used chemical glowing to re-shine the protein.
Ice cream, the eater that reacts with the tongue will increase the pH level of protein and the ice cream will shine.
Chris says that ice cream is ignited with the heat of the mouth, that is, win more will be licked, the more it will be ignited.
Charlie, founder of Lick Me I Am Delicious Ice Cream Company, said: "It's incredible thing on the early days of production me will get around 2 grams of stuff from £200".
The protein we are using in ice cream will react with a neutral pH in the tongue.
As soon as the mouth is hot, the proteins will increase the pH level and the ice cream will shine.
We have been executing for the past few months and it looks perfect for sharing on Halloween as it gives amazing glowing effect
It will probably be the most expensive ice cream that I made because the shine of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold
So the cost of each scoop comes to me around 140 pounds.
Although the taste is very good.
The experimental company based in Charlie's Bristol, including the apne, including beer, cheese, meat and gold leaf, is famous for the unusual taste.
But his next work is going to prove to be even more ambitious.
He said: "I really wanted to develop an invisible ice cream."
It is natural impossible because of the ice crystals that make refraction over ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream is useful for the resound properties of a jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists.

The court has blocked the crackdown of the New York Police Department and the action on the sports policy
On Thursday, a federal appeals court called for the New York Police Department's pause and order requiring a judge's order for the play program blocked the changes and removed the judge from the case.
US Circuit Court Appeal 2 & Justice Shira Shindeler has said that the judge's judgment will be pending results on the outcome of an appeal by the city.
Judge in the city had ruled in August in violation of the Constitution, out of his programme of interrogating people.
The city police department also includes the decision to allocate a monitoring to help its policy and the training program changes associated with it, its findings and its remedial order appealed.
The appeals court heard arguments on Tuesday on the request.
The appeals court has said that because he compromised the requirement for a judge to avoid the presence of bias in part of a series of media interviews and the public should be removed from the judge's case, so the wrongful acts should be removed from the judge's case, the statements must be publicly responded to criticizing the court.
The judge ruled that police officers wrongly violated the civil rights of thousands of people by targeting black and Hispanic men with its pause and play programme.
She has appointed an outside monitor to oversee major changes, including economic reforms in policies, training and supervision, and has ordered a pilot program for testing body-worn cameras on some premises where most often stops.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of those whose cases were rejected after a police stop.
An oral argument on the appeal of the city is scheduled for some time after the 14 March 2014.
The pause and play device have been criticized with civil rights advocates.
Break and play policy has been around for decades in some form, but most of the black and Hispanic men, have recorded the dramatic increase prevention under the administration of the independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, from 684330 to an all-time high in 2011.
A trial four men were filed by all minorities in 2004 and became a case of class action.
The NYPD's break and the play program's supporters have said that inappropriate behavior will end will be the end of a more reliable and effective police force and other police department using the policy may affect.
Opponents say the changes will reduce the morale of the police, but the crime, wasting money and not during the last decade will solve a broader problem of a police force under pressure after the pressures of thousands of officers.
The judge noted that the finish for pauses and plays was not kept, which is constitutional, but improved the implementation of the stop of the NYPD.
After the general elections, if the new government continues to stop the sale of kerosene through ration, then there will be no kerosene in these shops in half a dozen states.
The states where kerosene is to be stopped are Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand.
Apart from these, kerosene sales are also set to be discontinued in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and some northeastern states.
According to sources in the petroleum ministry, a decision will be taken to stop the sale of kerosene at PDS shops in states on two basis.
The first base is to make electricity connections rapidly in rural areas.
The second base is LPG connection.
That is, in most of the rural families of the states where LPG connections have been given, the sale of PDS kerosene is being stopped.
The Oil Ministry has made elaborate arrangements in this regard.
Since October 2013, the sale of PDS kerosene in Delhi has already been discontinued.
According to sources, under this policy, the kerosene quota for Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Uttarakhand has been significantly reduced.
Punjab's quota was reduced from 2.72 lakh kilos to one lakh kilolitres.
In Uttarakhand's allocation, 70 per cent reduction was reduced by about 40 per cent.
Despite this reduction, there has been no report of shortage of kerosene from these states.
The ministry is assuming that it is clear that kerosene has been used for adulteration.
The price of PDS kerosene and diesel is currently Rs 37.
This encourages the adulterers.
In states where sales through PDS will be discontinued, oil companies will sell kerosene at full price in the open market.
At present, oil companies are losing more than Rs 39 per litre on kerosene.
The burden of kerosene subsidy is estimated to be around Rs. 31 thousand crore in the year 2013-14.

Ben Greenman: Tenth anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
People can argue about that New York City is the birthplace of standup comedy in America: about a hundred years ago by comedian Frank Fey, who served as the master of the ceremony at the Palace Theatre in Broadway, began to tell people sitting in the crowd directly in the manner of conversation.
Fe's discovery has been expanding over the course of years, most recently, in the New York Comedy Fostival.
The festival, composed and operated by Caroline Hirsch, founder of Standup Institute called Carolines, celebrated its 10th anniversary this year, including more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theatres.
"Most of these headliners appeared in carolines, and became a huge success, to the level where they became huge to play at the club," says Hirsch.
We created this festival in the form of a way to continue working with them.
This year's event includes the presence of Vanda Cyces, Cathy Griffin and Bill Maihr, as well as annual music and comedy benefits for military retirees at Madison Square Gardens, "Stand Up for Heroes", including Bruce Springsteen, John Stuart, Roger Waters, and Bill Cosby among others.
With the extension of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Many comedians who participated in this year's celebration have come from non-traditional mediums, such as shows coming on smaller networks like Comedy Sentral, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll, the glare of the deep-cable sitcom (FXX, glaries to the Ronchi Fantasy-Fotball theme "The League"), reached the lead position, and is now his own comedy central sketch show.
Jenny Slate has been the cast member of "Saturday Night Live" and "Parks and Recreation", although she is best known for her viral video series "Marsal the Shell with Shoes On."
Other young comedians with different voices, including Crlaw and Slate (absolutely frustrated Anthony Jesselnic, satirical, ethnicity-focused W. earning bells) are the decentralized world products of American comedy.
Among the highlights of the festival will be, an interview: David Steinberg's talking to Larry David:
Steinberg began working as a standup comedian, but he has become a famous television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a show titled "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg" on TV Land.
The meeting will take place at Town Hall, in Manhattan, the Centre.
"The city is definitely in the comedy of Larry's all works, D.N.A.," Steinberg said.
He was telling me that when he was here, sometimes he goes to the street between two buildings and thought in himself that if I ever lost all my money, I would stay here.
Moving through soil, rivers and forest to provide free medical service
Dr. Georges Well is delivering free healthcare to the rural areas of Cameroon
Well and his team watch hundreds of patients on almost every weekend
West African countries do not have too many therapists; there is only one physician for 5000 people
Give your vote here or through mobile
Dr. Georges Well is one of the top 10 heroes of CNN in the year 2013.
You can vote for them or to make the CNN year hero for someone in the other top 10.
The winning person will receive $250,000 to continue his exceptional work.
For 21 years, Georges Well had seen his ailing father regained consciousness and fainting, going to the hospital, who was not properly facilitated to help him.
Jamel Well, in 1981, was injured in a car accident near Jounde, the capital of Cameroon.
Initially, his only hand was broken, but an infection increased that spread to his brain, and he created an abuse, which affected the rest of his life.
"There was no neurosurgeon in the cameraoon," says Georges Well.
If we had the money, we would have taken our father out of Cameroon.
Instead, Well kept visiting highly crowded clinics and hospitals with his father and received whatever treatment he could get.
"It's not easy," Well said.
You leave home at 5 a.m. hoping that you will be the first person to reach the hospital, but it doesn't happen.
There are many patients there.
Some people can get into the face of death while waiting.
The situation did not change much since the death of Well's father in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one physician for every 5000 person.
If compared, there is a therapist for 413 individuals in the United States.
And even if there are doctors, many residents of Cameroon cannot afford it.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and about two-thirds of the expenditure in healthcare in the country is in the private sector.
"Their only problem is poverty," says Well.
And being poor, they cannot enjoy their lives.
Seeing the pain of his father and his countrymen, Well took a firm resolve to solve it.
Dr. Georges and his team of volunteers have undergone 700 free surgeries last year.
He himself became a doctor, and started working as a vascular surgeon at the Center Hospital in Yonde.
And he launched the non-profit organization Eskovem, which goes to rural areas on weekends to provide free medical service.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped around 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, they and about 30 people sit in the van, tie medical supplies to the roof and go to rural areas where people need treatment.
Sometimes the fate is not with them.
They have to push the vehicle from rivers and soil more than once.
But when they arrive, they truly receive the honour of heroes: feasts, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation that the community can offer.
Free medical service in these villages is really the reason to celebrate, and Well - with its great smile and endless energy — is happy to include it.
The next morning his team begins to meet hundreds of patients.
"We are meeting 500 people in each journey," Well said.
They come from about 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
All these weekend clinics provide a variety of medical services.
Many people are treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Other people can get crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificate -- this document is required in school but many poor families cannot afford it.
In the evening the team performs simple surgery with spatial anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out at school buildings, town halls, or home; after the procedure, the patient walks and goes to the recovery place, and makes room for the next person.
The group's generator publishes in the operating room and sanitizing equipment, and Well and his volunteers work early in the morning on Sundays.
This is a swarmous pace, but the village musicians generally help keep the team motivated.
"They keep playing drums all night to keep us awake and continue their work," Well said.
On Sunday, their team returns to the city, they are tired, but they are proud of their work.
The group, including Cameroon's physicians and foreign medical students, has carried out 700 free surgeries last year, and they know that their support can change the world of people they help.
One person said that due to the free hernia surgery, he will be able to go back to work.
The man said, "This will change the future of me and my family."
In addition to running a weekend clinic and working as a surgery doctor at the hospital, Well also works at a private medical clinic around Yonde at night.
He pointed out that this is his second job that finances 60% of his non-profit work; the rest is completed by private donations.
"I don't know when they sleep," said Katy O'Maley, a second-year medical student at the University of Drexel in Philadelphia and a volunteer in a well group.
They are always either in the hospital, or trying to earn money for their organization, so that they keep running these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Mally who come from the United States and Europe to join Well's campaign, this is an experimental opportunity that they can never get in their country.
"We have been able to gain experimental experience in the surgical treatment in which we help Dr. Well hold tools or clear blood stains," said O'Maley.
As a second year medical student in the US, you will never have the opportunity to do so.
Volunteer students typically spend their close to Cameroon, and they often come with donation medical supplies.
But after reaching the yonda, they travel, and the expenses of the instructions are beared well.
"There is no doubt that they are heroes," says O'Maley.
They give their lives for this organization, and their desire to help the people of Cameroon is never going to end.
For Well, almost the same workload, is not a difficulty.
Helping other people live a happy life, fulfilling the promise made to their father, these are the things that give them great joy.
"I'm very happy when doing this work," says Well.
I think of my father.
I hope they see what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh, reduce their pain.

A proposal in this regard has been sent to the government by the ADA, which is going to be approved soon.
In this historic city surrounded by Ganga-Yamuna on three sides, there is no longer such a plot left on which ADA could make a big residential plan.
In such a situation, he has now made a plan to plan residential from Jhunsi towards the east, in the north direction, from Naini to the front of the north direction.
A meeting was held under the chairmanship of District Magistrate Rajshekhar to give a comprehensive look to this plan.
The ADA has formulated the idea of incorporating two hundred revenue villages of Phulpur, Soraon and Karchhana.
After coming to the limits of ADA, Chaka and Bahadur Block will be abolished.
At the same time, half of the area of Kaudihar block will also merge in ADA.
A proposal in this regard has been sent to the government, said ADA secretary Amarnath Upadhyay.
The ADA wants to take the boundary of these gram panchayats within its jurisdiction for planning, on which work will start soon.
If this happens, the rising prices of buildings in the city will come down.
At the same time, the availability of housing will also be easy for the common people.
Soon, residential palaces will start standing in this new area on the lines of Lucknow and Noida.

Mozambique's security concerns grow as powerful personalities as confrontation
With a statue of Mozambique founder President Samora, who was staring down at them, thousand people gathered in central Maputo to the slogan of peace in a rare public demonstration.
"We want peace back, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sussa, the chief executive officer of an investment company.

The conflict between government forces and Ray NaMo for two weeks has been reported almost daily since 20 years before a peace agreement.
Ray Namo was initially a notorious rebel of the movement supported by the white-ruled rodhosia and South Africa's apartheid government as part of efforts to destabilise the country's independent government.
After the 1992 peace agreement, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to return to a full-fledged conflict, but recent events have discouraged foreign investors and locals.
The stakes are high for a rapidly growing economy of the northwest of the northwest of the giant offshore gas reserves and the discovery of coal reserves of Rio Tinto, some of the companies including Well, Brazil's Well, Eni could bring from more than $50bn investment next year.
The ruling Frelimo Party, major political power since 1975, and Ray Namo blame each other for tensions.
Re Namo says the government began the latest conflict on October 17 by launching attacks on its members in Sofa La province, traditional Re Namo stronghold,
With the attack on former rebels and escalation, government forces attacked Renmo targets and told the Financial Times to try to kill Afonso Dhaka Ma, group leader, Fernando Majhang, Ray Namo spokesman.
The government blames Ray NaMo for triggering the confrontation, accusing them of attacking troops.
President Armando Jibuzhan has sought to address concerns about instability.
Mr. Jibujhan told AFP, French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhakama had seen himself as a "loyal" "whatever it is, his armies have been trying to prove that he can implement his own decision on the government."
Free Limo and Re NaMo both insist that they want to avoid war.
Mr. Mazhang was quoted as saying that the 1992 Peace Accord was revoked but has later again become a matter of concern.
He told FT means that the agreement is not being awarded by Free Limo
Our vision is to come back to the compromise negotiations, but seriously," Mr. Mazhang said.
The previous talks between the two sides did nothing special to de-escalate the hein of a series of conflicts this year.
"It's about the two big men fighting together (Jinkhajhan and Dhakama) about them," said Yusuf Han, a lecturer and a mozambique expert at the London Open University.
There are neither good negotiators of them and neither are they ready to make the types of concessions.
Ray Namo, has been pushing for electoral reforms, had already said about the boycott of the municipal elections to be held in November.
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for the next year.
Some commentators have interpreted their use of force as an attempt to a morbid movement to win concessions and economic loot from the government.
Ray Namo's share in the vote has been declining since 1992, while a new party, created by a former Ray NaMo member in which the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), is expected to improve his performance in the elections.
Mr. Majhang says Mr. Jibujhanko, who is stepping down at the end of his second term next year - wants to destroy the democracy of the country.
"He does not want a multi-party democracy, he does not want to give up the presidency because he does not want peace.

Pope Francis to announce the name of the first cardinal in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis will build a new cardinal of the Catholic Church for the first time in his tenure on February 22.
The Cardinals are the highest-class clergy in the Catholic Church, their position is only below the Pope, and these people choose the Pope, so Francis will rupend the first group of his individuals, who will eventually help him choose the successor.
There are a total of 201 cardinals.
By the way, after reaching the age of 80, the cardinal is not allowed to participate in the Pope's election - these come in a group of 120 "Cardinal Electors."
In a statement announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Fedrico Lombardy said that before the ceremony of the promotion of the new cardinals, a meeting of all existing cardinals will be held, which is called the Pope-Sayout.
"Pop Francis has decided to predict his decision to hold the February Pope-Council, so that it is easier to plan other meetings involving the Cardinals from different countries of the world," Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors was likely to decrease.
He said that in general, the Pope announces the name of the cardinal elector as few as the cardinal elector, as many cardinals, and the name of the cardinals who are above 80 years of age as he wish.
Valero said that the next year's pop-up will be important, because this will be the first Pope-samy after Francis was elected in March this year.
At present, there is a kind of bias towards Europe and especially Italy.
"It will be interesting to see if the new popes, even from the rest of the world, are nominating Cardinals to restore balance.
South America has forty percent Roman Catholics, but their number in the Cardinals is very small.
The Cardinals Council - a group of eight cardinals from around the world, whose task is to find ways to reform the church, will also be the first cardinals to be elected after it was formed.
Earlier, the Pope used to decide everything on his own.
"Right now Francis has chosen these eight Cardinals to assist," Valero said.
He said it was "possible" to seek advice from Francis Cardinals.
But we have not been in this situation before - it is completely new.
Valero said that generally the Pope gives the bishops of large places the cardinal position, but Francis was "completely surprising - so we don't know whose name they would declare."
Foreign staff on 457 visas can undergo "certificance" test
A "certificance" test for foreign employees on 457 visas is being considered by the government, as it aims to extend a rigorous action.
If adopted, this test will be implemented through a norms aimed at preventing the 457 used to fill unskilled positions in Australia or to transport family and friends in a disguised manner.
Today a government discussion paper was issued, condemning the government's vocabulary about foreign workers, former Labourer M.P. Maxine McQuew said today that it could anger Australia's neighboring countries.
He told the US India Institute today that "foreigners are arriving at the end of the queue" and the loud rhetoric about "jobs first to the Australians" is a very unpleasant duplication at a time when the unions have demanded a safe labor market.
Historically, this meant that white workers should have been provided protection - and I wouldn't be surprised if some people in the region had seen the echo of that historical evidence.
The letter shows a framework of 12 measures that were previously considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he met officials about the smuggling people, has executed five recommended changes, while the rest are under consideration.
If the "certificance" criteria were adopted, the visa applicant may be examined as to "is the enrolment in a situation where the nominee is a relative or personal partner of the person who sponsors the visa".
Businessmen may need to keep the number of 457 visa holders calculated, as previously businessmen who wanted to sponsor a small number of employees hired hundreds of people.
Meanwhile, the 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee died of a suspicious heart attack after arriving in a refugee boat on Christmas Island this week.
The man's nine-year-old son was on a trip with him to Australia, and after his father's death on Wednesday, one of his adult cousins has been suffocated by his adult cousin, who was on the same vessel.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
