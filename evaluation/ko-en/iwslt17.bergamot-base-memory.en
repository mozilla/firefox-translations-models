This is a story about how we know what we know.
This is a story about this woman, Natalia Lipchinski.
She's a paleontologist, that is, she's an expert at digging up things that died a very long time ago.
Natalia Lipchinski: Yes, you call me "Dr. Dead."
LN: And what I was interested in was where she dug things up, and she works in the remote Canadian tundra region, much above the Arctic Circle.
One summer day, she was at the excavation site called Fyles Leaf Bed, less than ten degrees from the self-norticulation.
Natalia: Yeah? It wasn't a great thing at all, because I'd been walking all day, picking up everything that looked like fossils in my backpack, with GPS and a laptop.
LN: And at some point, she realizes something.
Natalia: It was rusty, it was a rusty color, just like my palm.
It just fell to the ground.
LN: At first, she thought it was just a piece of wood, because at Fyles Leaf Bed, people had discovered prehistoric plant fossils before.
That night, I went back to camp.
Natalia: I took out a portable magnifying glass, and I looked at it a little bit more closely, and I realized that it doesn't look like it's a nite.
I thought maybe it was something that we had to preserve, but it's really something that's supposed to be something that
It looked like a bone.
LN: So over four years, she's been exploring the area, and in the end, we've collected 30 pieces of the same bone, most of which were really small pieces.
Natalia: It's not a big deal, I've tried it, and it's all in one of the ziplocks.
LN: And she tried to fit the bones together like a puzzle.
But it was very difficult.
Natalia: I've been carving so much that I've been using sand and bonding agents, and they didn't look good.
So in the end, I shot it with a 3D scanner.
LN: Oh! Natalia: Yeah, good?
LN: Actually, it was a much easier way.
Natalia: It was magical to make the pieces into one.
LN: How sure were you that these pieces were put together?
Was it possible that it was not a good assembly, a small lovebird or a bone of something else?
Natalia: Well, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
LN: According to her, what she found was a tibia, a leg bone, and, to be precise, a leg bone of a mammal whose hooves were cracked, animals like cows and sheep.
But there were no two animals.
Because the bones were too big.
Natalia: It was really big, it was a very large animal bone.
LN: So what kind of animal is that?
While she was struggling, she showed a piece to a colleague in Colorado and they gave a good opinion.
Natalia: We put a piece of the end out with a saw, and in the gap, it smelled really interesting.
LN: It smelled like flesh burning.
The smell was the smell she was taking when she took a gross anatomy class, the smell of collagen.
Collagen plays a structural role in the bones.
And usually, as time goes on, it collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic was preserved as a natural freezer.
1 or 2 years later, Natalia will be seen demonstrating that her colleague, Mike Buckley, is a "collagen fingerprinting" at a conference in Bristol.
The content is that different species have slightly different collagen structures, so if you have a collagen structure here, you can compare it to the structure of a species that has been identified, and you might find something that matches.
So she sent a piece to a colleague, FedEx.
Natalia: Yeah, I'm going to check the shipment. It's important.
LN: And he did an analysis and compare it to thirty-seven species of modern mammals.
I found something to match.
As a result of the investigation, this bone is a bone from three and a half million years ago, and the owner of this bone, which Natalia dug up in the Arctic Circle,...
It was a camel.
Natalia: I did this at the time. What? That's amazing -- if that's true.
LN: So we did the tests on the other pieces, and the test results were all the same.
But according to the size of the bones found, this camel is 30 percent larger than modern camels.
And this camel is nine feet tall and weighs about one ton.
Yes.
Natalia has found a giant Arctic camel.
Now, when you hear the word "camel," you hear, what you're hearing is that East Asia, Central Asia, Ssangbong Nakta, is a place where you can hear the word "camel."
There may be a single camel in your head that usually appears on a postcard, a typical desert animal that lives in a hot desert, like the Middle East or the Sahara, and it has a large hump on its back, and it stores moisture for long desert trekking, and it crosses sand dunes with big and wide feet.
So how did these guys get to the Arctic Circle?
Well, scientists have known for a long time that what was revealed before Natalia's discovery was that the camel was actually from the United States.
This is the first time I've seen a camel here.
About forty-five million to forty-five million years ago, camels first appeared and lived only in North America. It turns out there were twenty species, and there could be more.
LN: Can you compare all of the camels to distinguish between them?
Natalia: Yes, camels are different in size.
Some camels have really long-necked species, actually giraffe-like camels.
LN: What species have a crocodile-like snout?
Natalia: The primitive camel was really, really small, almost like a rabbit.
LN: What? A rabbit-sized camel?
Natalia: Your primitive camel.
It's probably hard to see a camel.
LN: Oh my God, I want to raise a rabbit camel.
Natalia: Me too. Don't you think it's good?
LN: And about three hundred to seven million years ago, a species of camel moved to South America, where it evolves into llamas and alpacas, and the other species passes through the Bering ethroas to Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the ice age, North American camels go extinct.
Scientists knew all this, but they didn't fully explain what Natalia had found in the north.
For example, in terms of temperature, the polar region is the complete opposite of the Sahara.
To be precise, three and a half million years ago, on average, it was about twenty degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.
So the Arctic Circle would have been an Ahandae forest, like today's Yukon Juju or Siberia.
But it was still an area where winter lasted for six months, and the pool of water froze, and the water pool was frozen.
It would have been where the blizzard would have taken place.
It would have been a polar-field area that lasted twenty-four hours.
How... how?
How could this Saharan superstar survive the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her colleagues come up with one hypothesis.
And it was a pretty girly thought.
What if the camels we think can adapt well to places like the Sahara, in fact, evolved to survive the winter?
What if the wide feet of a camel were not to cross the desert, but to walk on snow?
What if the camel's hump -- was big news for me, not that it contained water, that it contained fat, and that helped me get through the six months of winter when I was short of food?
And what if later, if the camel crossed the Bering Bridge and adapted these features for a hot desert environment in the winter long after?
For example, it's going to help with the back or the hot climate, because the fat in the body is concentrated in one place, like a fat venan, so you don't need a heat insulation to wrap around your whole body.
The hump on the back makes it easy to block the heat.
Sounds strange, but the essential reason for a camel to live in the desert could be evidence that in the past camels lived in the Arctic Circle.
I’m not the first to tell this story.
Others see this as a wonder of evolutionary biology or that it will be the key to future climate change.
But the reason I like this story is different.
I think this is a story about us, a story about how we look at the world and how it changes.
I'm a historian.
And I've come to realize that many scientists are like historians.
It’s like proving the past.
Scientists talk about the universe, the earth, and life on Earth.
And as a historian, I've been thinking about where this story is going.
Natalia: We make hypotheses and think that hypotheses are true, like camels live in the desert, right?
That's the right story! I believed it completely.
As you can see, the camel lives in the desert.
Rataf: But at some point, you find very little evidence,
From that little thing, everything you've ever known can be turned upside down.
In this case, a scientist discovered a piece of wood that he thought was a tree, and with it, the scientific community came up with a completely new and counterintuitive theory about why this Dr. Sous-like animal looked like this.
And for me, the idea of a camel was completely reversed.
It's a ridiculously rare animal that can only be grown in a certain environment, an animal that travels around the world and arrives in the Sahara, and it's actually not strange to be anywhere in the world.
This guy is Ajuri.
How are you feeling?
So, here, eat this one.
Azari is taking a break from regular performances at Radio City Music Hall.
It's not a joke.
Anyway -- the reason Azuri came out here is to let you know that the story of this world is dynamic.
It's something we need to adapt and imagine again.
Is that right?
And actually, a small piece of bone has renewed the world we see.
Thank you.
Today's computers are so amazing that at the same time it's hard to see how terrible it is.
I'm going to show you the problems of computers today, and I'm going to show you how to solve them with neuroscience.
First, let me tell you about an important event that happened to me on a cold night in Harlem.
I was sitting in a bar outside Columbia University, where I majored in computer science and neuroscience, and I was in a bar with a friend and I was in a conversation that one day holograms would replace computers.
And as our conversation was at its peak, my friend's phone rang.
My friend pulled his phone down and looked down and started typing.
And he raised his eyes hard and looked me up and said, “Keep listening.”
But in the eyes of my friend, there was no heat, and the moment was already cold.
On the other side, another student took out his phone and handed it to the group.
He was handing over photos of Instagram and laughing happily with the group.
I felt hurt, and at the same time, the fact that it was the same technology that made me happy was the same.
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the content of the digital information itself did not have a different result, but simply that I and my friends were separated according to the direction of the screen, and that the other side was united together.
The fact that they were bonded with a cell phone was like the ancients sitting around a campfire and talking about it, raising their social skills.
I think tools need to function like this.
It has to be an extension of the body.
And I think today's computers are the opposite.
Whether you're emailing your wife, writing a symphony, or comforting a friend, you do the same thing on your computer.
Face the squares, touch the buttons and menus to bring in other squares.
I think this is wrong, I think we can use a much more natural machine.
We have to use machines that do things in the real world.
We need to apply neuroscience principles to machines to expand our senses without going against them.
There's a machine right here right now.
This is Meta2.
Let's write it.
I can see with my own eyes and my hands alive with the audience in front of me.
When I count three, two, one, I see a real hologram, and now I'm in front of a very real hologram, in front of the very device that I'm using right now.
This hologram is a product that we shop for, a product that we explore, and it can move with our hands.
Iron Man is proud of that.
We'll see this machine again in a moment.
If you're like me, you're imagining what's possible with this technology, so I'm going to show you.
My mother is an architect, and naturally I thought about expressing architecture in 3D, not 2D as it is now.
Mothers can even touch graphics and choose interior decorations.
This is a real video shot in Meta2.
The following example resonates with me, Professor Adam Gazali's Transparent Brain Project. I have received UCSF's understanding.
As a neuroscience student, I've always imagined learning and memorizing complex brain structures with the help of machines, touching and playing with complex brain structures, and this technology is called a "abged reality."
But I think it's a process of expanding our body's capabilities with the help of machines, not the opposite.
Now...
In a few years, humanity will undergo a major transformation.
Humanity will begin to build a layer of digital information that corresponds to the real world.
Imagine what this would call a change, a storyteller, a painter, a brain surgeon, an upholster, a user here.
And I think we should all work together and discuss the direction to create this new reality through a lot of effort and effort, and think about how to expand the human experience, not make it into a game or fill it with information.
And I'm very passionate about this.
Now, let me tell you a little secret.
In about five years, this is not a minimal device, it's going to be improved in about five years in a thin strip of glass that projects a hologram onto the eye, and just like when we buy a cell phone, looking at an operating system rather than a hardware, I've always dreamed of making iOS for the mind as a neuroscientist.
The development of this OS should be very careful, because as long as we use Windows, we may have a long time to live in the new OS.
I don't know about you, but I'm afraid to live on Windows.
To find the most intuitive interface for users, we put neuroscience at the heart of design, and we don't see design squeezed out of the conference room.
The principle we always think about when designing is to look for “the least-infected neural circuit.”
At every stage, we're trying to connect the mind's iOS with the intuition of the brain, and in other words, we're going to build a computer that doesn't need to be used.
We are building a computer that we can use instinctively.
The following three design guidelines are for new user experiences.
And that's what we're looking for. The first thing that's important is that
You are the operating system itself.
Conventional file systems are complex and intuitive, forcing additional understanding into your brain.
That is, it does not go through the circuit with the least dissatisfying.
On the other hand, in augmented reality, you can put a hologram TED screen here, an email on the other side, or you can use the spatial power of reality to pull a hologram.
You can take out the Tesla car you were shopping for, just for the model that the legal team agreed to use before the talk.
Okay, the brain understands this process perfectly.
The second commandment is to “to see by touch.”
What do babies do when they get their attention?
I'm trying to reach out and touch it.
This is how natural machines work.
It turns out that in order for a visual system to have a great effect, it has to feel the sense of self-acceptance, where the body is.
Therefore, if you can touch it directly, you can understand not only the ease of manipulation, but also the content more deeply.
To see by touch.
But the experience alone is not enough.
We are social animals.
This is our third guideline: a hologram bonfire that's being stretched out in the story.
By mirror neurons in the human body, we can immerse ourselves in the work we do with others by 3D of their faces and hands.
If you look at the video behind me, two meta users play together in the same hologram, and they make eye contact with each other, not because of the device, but because of the device, they don't fall apart.
So let's put the neuroscience back in mind, and let's rewrite it.
I'm back to iOS for the spirit.
This time, I'm going to go further and take this device by hand, and then put it next to my desk.
I'm with you. I'm connected.
I can take this device according to my spatial ability and put it back in my place, because I'm the operating system.
Now, with the sense of self-acceptance working, I can break this device down into thousands of parts and touch the same sensor that is scanning my hands.
But I'm serious about seeing it myself, so I'm going to talk to co-founder Ray in 3D.
Ray, how are you?
Ladies and gentlemen, I'm looking at this guy in 3D right in front of my eyes.
Like it really is.
Thank you.
My mirror neuron says that this function will replace the phone in the near future.
Ray, how are you?
Yes, we're live.
Ray, give the audience the first holographic brain you've ever shown.
Ladies and gentlemen, this device is going to change not only the phone, but also the way we work together.
Thank you.
Thanks Ray.
What.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message that I found in the bar in 2011, that the future of computers is not locked in square screens.
Right here, inside of us.
What I can tell you today is that the natural machine is not the science fiction of the future, it's the 2016s.
Meta has already built this device, so hundreds of Meta’s administrations, executives, designers, and technologists will ditch all of the monitors in the company until TED2017 and turn it into a truly, really natural machine.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, people.
CA: I have one question for you, and there have been a few augmented reality demonstrations outside of the past year.
Each time, there was a debate among the technicians about whether the demonstration scene was the actual user's vision.
It's a matter of viewing angles, and it's that the demonstration video doesn't really look more like a device than it looks.
Is it what you see in the video?
Meron: Not as it is.
Not only that, but through a lot of adjustments, I filmed all the images while filming the real lens with the camera.
When I was watching the video, I put a lot of effort into making it to give you an experience that you actually use the device.
CA: Thank you for your attentive consideration.
Thank you so much. It's rewarding.
I come from Seattle, Washington, the most liberal, generous, progressive country in the United States.
I grew up in a house that I believe Seattle is the best.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a university professor, and I'm so grateful for the upbringing I received, because I was able to design my life comfortably.
In fact, I didn’t follow the same way my parents wanted me to.
At nineteen, I dropped out of college, I was kicked out, I was a nuisance.
I went to see Professor Franchhorn, who I had been waiting for in my dream.
I played chamber music in the U.S. and Europe, and I traveled for two years with a wonderful jazz guitarist named Charlie Bird.
By the end of my twenties, I was a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
It's a wonderful life.
My parents never complained.
You gave me all the support.
It wasn't what they wanted.
My parents would tell their neighbors and friends, "My son is in a vacuum."
And I had a little uncomfortable conversation about my life, and I want to tell you about it.
I came back from Barcelona when I was twenty-seven, and I visited my parents for Christmas, and I was cooking in the kitchen with my mother.
My mother was so quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said to my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
He said, “Your father and I are really worried about you.”
So I said, "Well, what should I be like now?"
My mother said, "I really want you all to tell me: Have you ever voted for a Republican?"
Yes, I was actually just a French Horn player who wasn't interested in politics.
But what happened was that my parents knew about it, and there was some confusion.
I've become an ardent supporter of capitalism, and I'll tell you why.
It stems from poverty, which is my lifelong concern.
I remember when I first grew up in Seattle when I saw poverty.
We were a little below the middle class, but we weren't poor.
I couldn't get anywhere near it.
The first time I saw poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was seven years old.
I was just a normal kid.
I saw a picture of a kid my age in East Africa, published in National Geographic magazine, and his face was full of flies and his abdomen was dilated.
I knew he wouldn't live.
Some of you may remember that picture, even if it's not one of them.
It shows the West endless poverty in the world.
The picture haunted me until I was old enough to go to school, dropped out of school, went back in, and set up a family.
And what happened to that child,
I wonder what happened to those people in the world.
So even though I wasn't in college, I started studying, and I tried to find the answer: What's going to happen to the poorest people in the world?
Would it have been worse? Would it have been better?
I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I'm going to share it with you.
Look -- most Americans believe poverty is worse than it was in their childhood.
When Americans ask, “Is global poverty bad?”, 70 percent of people say hunger is worse than it was in the early 1970s.
But the truth is,
It changed my mind.
From 1970 until now, the share of hunger in the world living on less than one per day has decreased by 80 percent over inflation.
Since I was a child, the world’s poverty has fallen by 80 percent.
I didn't even know it.
That's really a miracle.
That's what we should celebrate.
It's the best record in human history to break poverty, and it happened in our time.
And when I found out about it, I was wondering, how was it possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you know why, you can save two million other poor people from poverty, and that's our theme: Since I was a child, at least two billion people have gone out of poverty.
I would like the other two billion.
I tried to find the answer.
Not a political answer that I don’t care about.
I still don’t care about politics.
I was trying to find answers on all sides of the economy.
The answer is this.
Let's see why.
There are five reasons why 20 billion people have been able to get out of poverty.
Number one: Globalization.
Second: free trade.
Third: The right to poverty
Fourth: provisions of the law
Fifth, create.
The large-scale free business system that made that work possible spread around the world in the 1970s.
It's not naïve.
Free business is not perfect, but free business is not all we need to make the world a better place.
But that's a good thing.
Not political.
Here's what I learned. This is a revelation.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
It's the best thing, it's about aspiration, which is what a lot of people on this stage have been talking about, and aspiration comes from a dream and is embedded in a free business.
We need to share with more people, similar to the first one.
Let me tell you a second story, because I think it's going to make both the home and the world better.
My favorite quote is that it implies what I've said about saving people from poverty, and it's like: "The free market has created the greatest wealth in history."
They've lifted a billion dollars of poverty.
Who would have said this?
It looks like Milton Friedman or Ronal Regan.
No.
President Obama said.
How would I remember?
He told me.
It's crazy.
I said, "Hallelujah."
But other than that, I said, "It's an opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, there was an event at Georgetown University where we participated as the main characters.
And that's the biggest problem that the United States is facing today.
I thought it was the answer, what is it? With this idea, progress and conservatism, to the person who needs us the most.
I'm not trying to tell you that we're in crisis, that the U.S. and other countries around the world are suffering from political polarization.
We're getting into a crisis.
It's not good. It's not right.
Last year, there was an article in the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
And this is an article about political imbalances published in 2014.
What is this? What do psychologists say about the idea of love, and what do you believe is that the opposite side is derived from hate?
The answer is a common conflict.
It can be seen in Israel and Palestine.
The author of this article found that most Republicans and Democrats in the United States today suffer from political imbalances.
Today's political actors believe that their motivation is paril and the opposition is hatred.
Think about it.
Many people walk around and say, "You know, my thoughts are from compassion, I want to help others, but other people are demons and they're disturbing me."
We can't develop a group that has that imbalance.
It's impossible.
How do we solve it?
Let's be honest: there's a difference.
You can make a difference: really pure.
It requires a lot of scrutiny.
This is Jonathan Hyde, a veteran on the TED stage.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He explores people's ideas, values, and morality to see the difference, and as he shows, progress and Democrats think different things are important.
Jonathan Heit, for example, said the Progressive Party cares more about poverty than economic freedoms by more than 59 percent.
And the Conservatives are more interested in economic freedom than poverty by 28 percent.
It's an incompatible difference, isn't it?
You're never gonna be able to get together. You're wrong.
That diversity makes it rich.
Remember what broke poverty.
The idea of economic freedom and the obsession with poverty spread around the world.
In other words, we need each other, and if we want to save the next two billion people from poverty,
There is no other way.
Hmm.
What do we do?
It's not picky.
You need an innovative idea.
There's a lot of these things.
Social entrepreneurs, yes, I'm sure. It's phenomenal.
We need to invest in overseas, in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way.
Do you know what the most important thing is?
Flexible thinking is required.
We need to be less predictable.
Isn't that right?
When do we not think that our ideas have become predictable?
It's a clique.
Don’t you feel like you’re always listening to people who are sympathetic to you?
Why is that dangerous?
We talk about the economy in this country, and we talk about taxes, regulation, and government, conservatively.
And on the progressive side, we're talking about the income disparity in the economy.
Right? This is important, and it's important to me and to you.
But when you think of people who are hungry, it's just a hindrance.
We need to find the best way to break poverty in the best possible way, to understand the Conservative Party needs progress, the Progressive Party needs poverty, the Progressive Party needs the Conservative Party, and the Progressive Party needs the Liberal market.
That's the diversity that's going to make this country even more rich, if we realize it.
What do we do? How do we do that together?
There is a handout of action for you and me.
Number one: remember, it's not enough to put up with the opponent.
And that's not the only thing.
We need people who are willing to do our job, because they need our solutions.
What are you going to do next? How are you going to do it?
Where do we start? Here we go.
All of us here are blessed.
Because there are people who listen to us.
We have been blessed with prosperity and we have been blessed by leadership.
When people hear our stories about unpredictable ideas, they probably listen.
From there, development begins.
That's the first one.
Number two: I ask you and myself, can you be such an ambiguous and difficult person to break down the boundaries of difference?
If you are a conservative, stay a hero of the poor and always talk about poverty and moral obligations.
And if you're a progressive, you're going to be a liberal who's debating the benefits of a free market to solve a problem.
If so, we have two benefits.
Number one: we're going to solve the problem of the next two billion people, and we need to be able to see the solutions we've seen in the past in the future.
Secondly, we can turn the ideological confrontation that this country is experiencing into a competition of thought through mutual respect.
And maybe you'll see that the difference isn't that big.
Thank you.
When I was in college, I majored in political science, so I had a lot of tasks to write about.
The average student will be distracted this way when they're doing the work.
You know, it starts a little bit slower at first, but if you do as much as you do in the first week, you do it in more quantities later, and everything ends up in an organized way.
I want to do that too.
That's how you plan it.
It's all ready, but when the task actually comes up, it's going to be like this.
This happened on every task.
There was a ninety-page graduation paper, a year that I had to invest in.
I knew I couldn’t do what I normally do.
It's too important to do that.
So I made a plan and I thought I'd do this.
Spend a year like this.
At first, you start with a trace, and then you start with a little bit of speed, and at the end of the day, you're going to do it a little bit, like a little staircase, a month.
How hard is it to climb stairs?
Nothing, right?
But something really funny happened.
The First Month
Time passed and I didn’t do much.
So I made a wonderful revision of the plan.
And then the middle of the month just passed, and I didn't write anything, so it happened.
Two months became a month, and it was another two weeks.
And one day, when I woke up, I had only three days left, and I didn't write a single letter, so I did what I could. I spent seventy-two hours, not a day, two nights, and if you're a human, you can't spend two nights, and you can't run across the campus, and you're in a slow motion, and you've dived in, and you've barely made it to the deadline.
I thought I was done with it.
A week later, I got a call from school.
"Is that Tim Urban?"
I said, "Yes."
"I have something to say about the paper," he said.
I said, "Do it."
And that's what the school says, "That's the best paper I've ever seen."
That didn't happen.
It was a very, very poor paper.
I just wanted to enjoy a moment where you think, "This guy's great!"
No, no, it was really bad.
Anyway, I am a blogger now.
I run a blog called “Wait a minute, but why.”
A few years ago, I was going to write about procrastination.
My actions have always puzzled people who don't put off doing what's going on around them, and I wanted to explain to them what's going on in the minds of people who are procrastinating, and why we're procrastinating.
I had one hypothesis: the brain of people who put off doing things is different from the brains of other people.
To verify this, I went to an MRI lab, and I had to scan both of my brains, and I scanned the brains of proven non-protested people, and I compared them.
I brought it to you today.
Please see if you see any differences.
Unless you're a trained brain expert, the difference may not be obvious, but take a look.
This is the brain of someone who doesn't procrastinate.
Now...
This is my brain.
There's a difference.
They both have "reasonable decision-makers," but there's also "momentary satisfaction monkeys" in the procrastinator's brain.
What does this mean for someone who is putting off doing something?
It means everything is fine until this happens.
[I think it's better now.] [No!] A rational decision-maker will make a rational decision to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like it, so he grabs the steering wheel and says, "Let's read all the Wikipedia pages of the Nancess Kerrigan and the Tonya Harding scandal, because the scandal just came to mind, and then, and then, and let's go to the refrigerator and see if there's anything new more than ten minutes ago.
And then you go to YouTube, and Richard Feynman starts with a video that explains the magnet, and then you spend a long time watching the last video of Justin Bieber interviewing his mother.
It all takes a lot of time, so I don’t have time to do anything today.
I'm sorry!"
What's going on?
A momentary satisfaction monkey is not the kind of kid who wants to get behind the wheel.
He is living in the present moment.
I don't have any past memories or knowledge of the future, I only care about two things: the easy and the fun.
In the animal world, that would be fine.
If you're a puppy and you've been doing something easy and fun all your life, it's a successful life!
For this monkey, man is just another species of animal.
You just have to sleep well, eat well, multiply well, that's all it would have been in the tribal era.
You know, but it's not a tribal age anymore.
Now is the age of advanced civilization, and monkeys don't know what it is.
So there's another entity in our brain, a rational decision-maker, which gives us the ability to do things that animals can't do.
You can dream of the future,
I can see the big picture,
You can also make a long-term plan.
Rational decision-makers are trying to take this all into account.
I want to make sure that I do something that's reasonable right now, and sometimes it's easy and fun to do.
There are times when it's appropriate, when you're having dinner, when you're sleeping, when you're having good leisure time, so there's a overlap.
Sometimes they are each other’s opinion.
But sometimes it's hard, and it's not very pleasant, but it's much more reasonable to do things, for the greater sake.
That's when there's a conflict.
For those who put off work, that conflict always ends in the same way, spending a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun kingdom out of a rational kingdom.
I call it the Dark Playground.
The Dark Playground is a place that everyone who puts off work knows well.
It's a place where leisure activities happen, and sometimes you don't have to do leisure activities.
Fun in a dark playground isn't really fun, because it's not worth playing, and the air is full of guilt, fear, anxiety, self-hate, and it's all a feeling of people putting off work.
The question is, in this situation, if a monkey is on the rise, how do people who procrastinate go to the blue zone, where less fun, but important things happen?
Fortunately, there's a guardian angel who puts off work, and he's always looking down on him and protecting him at the bleakest moment, and that's what a panic monster is.
Panic monsters are dormant most of the time, but suddenly wake up when the deadline is approaching, publicly embarrassing, disaster-possed, or in danger of a fearsome back-and-forth.
The important thing is that it is the only thing that the monkey is afraid of.
Until recently, I was very close to life. Six months ago at TED, I got in touch and invited me to a talk.
Of course, I said I would.
I always had the dream of giving a TED Talk.
But I think the rational decision-maker has a different idea.
He said, "You know what we've accepted?
Do you understand what will happen in the future?
You have to sit down and start right now."
And the monkey said, "I'm totally agree with you, but now let's just open Google Earth and zoom in on the southern tip of India to get to know India better, and scroll up for two and a half hours until we reach the northern end of India at 200ft above sea level."
So that day I did it.
Six months is four months, two months, one month, and TED Talks have announced the speaker.
When I open the website, my face is looking at me.
Who woke up?
So the panic freak starts to get into a mess, and after a few seconds, the whole system got into a frenzy.
Then the monkey, afraid of panic monsters, runs away over a salty tree!
And finally, a rational decision-maker took the lead and worked on the talk.
The panic monster explains the behavior of real people who put off their work, how they use the first sentence of the task over the course of two weeks, and how people like me, like me, who miraculously find a sense of work ethics, spend eight pages a night in search of work.
All these situations are explained by three figures, this is the system of the person who puts things off.
It doesn't look very good, but it works in the end.
So I wrote a blog about this a few years ago.
When I wrote, people's reactions were amazing.
It's literally sent thousands of emails to a wide range of people doing different things around the world.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a lot of doctoral students.
They all said the same thing: "I have the same problem."
But what surprised me was that the blog's writing was a light tone, and the email contrasted with a very serious tone.
These people were very frustrated about what life was like because they were really putting off work, and they were very frustrated about what the monkey had done to them.
I looked at this and I thought, why is the system of procrastinators working?
Why are all these people in a dark place?
As it turned out, there were two kinds of procrastination.
In today's example, we've all had deadlines, and when we have those deadlines, we're going to have to wait for the deadlines.
The consequences of procrastination are limited to a short period of time, because panic monsters are involved.
But the second kind of procrastination happens when there's no deadline.
If you want to work in a self-employed business, like in the arts or in the business, there's no deadline for this, because nothing happens until you step up and work, and there's a lot of important things that don't have a deadline other than a job.
If it's a panic monster that can make people do these difficult things, it's because they don't have a deadline, because they don't have a deadline, they don't wake up.
So the consequences of procrastination are not limited, they just go on forever.
It's funny, it's short-term, it's much worse than the kind of deadline, it doesn't get much better, it doesn't get much more discussed, and it's usually quietly alone.
This can be a significant source of long-term unhappiness and regret, and I think that's why people send emails.
That's why they're in a very bad situation, not because they're cramming assignments.
Long-term procrastination is like yourself
Sometimes it makes you feel like an onlooker in your life, and it's not because you don't achieve your dreams, but because you're not making your dreams come
I couldn't even start my dream, so I read these emails, and I got a little bit of an idea, and I don't think there's anyone who doesn't put off.
That's right, you're all procrastinating.
Well, you may not be as messed up as we are, you may have a healthy friendship with a deadline, but remember, the monkey's subtle trick comes when there's no deadline.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call this the life calendar.
There is one box every week in ninety years.
There aren't many boxes, especially we've already used a lot of boxes.
I think you need to look at this calendar for a long time.
We need to think about what we're putting off, because everyone's putting off something in their life.
You should always be aware of the instant satisfaction monkey.
That's what we all have to do.
There are not many boxes left in the calendar, so you probably need to start today.
Well, not today, or something.
What,
Soon to come.
Thank you.
That day, we were having the last days of our lives, the souls and bodies of the church in Texas.
It's like this room that's gathered here, but it's a squeaky-clean wooden chair with an old red cloth, and the organ is on my left and behind me, and the baptist bath is on the wall behind the choir.
Even so, it was similar here.
Like this place, there was tension, the hope of salvation was full, the hands were holding sweat, and the people sitting in the back were not paying attention.
It was the night of the second coming of Jesus on December 31st, and I knew it was the end of the world.
I was twelve years old and I felt responsible.
And as soon as I was old enough to be responsible for what I had done, I thought it would be better to stop complaining that it was unfair for Jesus to return and clean up the house very quickly.
I went to church as often as possible.
I listened to the stillness as hard as people listened to the sound, to be sure that God wouldn't take me first, and I decided to go home early.
When Jesus returned, I read the "resented ones" that were fashionable at the time and prepared an alternative.
In the book, I said that if I don't fall into the ecstasy of the second coming at midnight, I have a chance.
To do this, I had to avoid receiving the mark of the beast and fight the devil, the plague, and the antichrist.
It was hard, but I believed I could do it.
But the time for planning is over.
The clock ticked at eleven-fifty.
Ten minutes until the second coming, and the pastor called us to come out of the chair to the foundation, because he wanted to pray when midnight came.
So all the believers gathered together.
The choir remained in the choir, and the clergy and their wives sat at the front of the foundation to call upon what I wanted to call them.
In the United States, there are VIP seats even on the day of the Second Coming of Jesus.
And there were the elders right behind the Baptist bourgeoisie, who were the old men, who were the hot sun on the cotton farm in eastern Texas, bent their waists on their young days, burned their wrinkle-free, bleak brown skin like mud in eastern Texas, and the dreams and hopes of what life would be like outside East Texas are sometimes more baked and broken than their bent waists.
These guys were the main characters of the day for me.
They've been waiting their whole lives for this moment, just as their medieval ancestors had been waiting for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother was waiting for the Oprah Winfrey Show to be on the 8th channel at four o'clock every day.
When she was on her way to the Foundation, I was close to her, and I was sure that she was going to go to heaven, and if she held her hand in prayer, she would be able to do it.
I thought I could go with him, so I held my hand and closed my eyes to listen and wait.
Prayer increased and the answer to prayer.
It was ringing louder and louder.
The organ was adding more songs here.
I also sweat in the heat.
I grabbed my hand and tried not to leave it alone.
I closed my eyes more tightly and didn't want to see people fall apart.
And a voice echoed over us in prayer: "Amen."
It's over.
Looking at the clock
It was already past midnight.
I looked at the elders, their saviors didn't come, they didn't show any disappointment, but they began to doubt, who had believed too much and too long.
I was angry when I saw them.
They've been fooled, they've been blindfolded, they've been snoring, and I've been right next to them.
I prayed for them and tried not to fall into temptation.
I dipped my head twice, not once, in the baptistic bath that made me runny.
I was desperate.
What do I do now?
When I got home and I played TV, I could see Peter Jennings declaring a new thousand years, going around the world.
The sudden thought here was that it was strange for Jesus to go around the world and return to the time zone.
This made me even more ridiculous and really hurt.
But that day I didn’t lose faith.
I'm just starting to believe in something new that it's possible not to believe.
The answer I have may be wrong, and the problem itself may be wrong.
And once upon a time, a great assurance, like a mountain, flowed down to its source, a spring of doubt, a spring of water that promised a river.
I vividly remember the day that my Savior didn't show up that night in church, going back to my whole life, when I learned that what I believed most was that it wasn't a lie, but it wasn't the truth.
Most of you may have welcomed Y2K in a different way, but I'm sure some of you have been here to see my talk because some of you have experienced something like mine since the beginning of the new millennia, after my mother left and my father walked away, and since the savior didn't show up.
I held my hand and found a place to lean on.
I entered Yale at the age of eighteen, with the faith that I grew up with in Oak Cliff Texas, the opportunity to leave behind the many exams I went through and the loss of my body and mind.
But when I came home one winter break, what I found was a two-handed hand tied to my face and back on the floor, and a robber's gun on my head, and I knew that I couldn't be saved even though I studied a lot.
I also had faith in Lehman Brothers, who worked as an intern in 2008.
We were filled with hope, and we called our families and told them that we would no longer be poor.
But after I saw this temple of finance collapse before my eyes, I realized that I could not be saved even in the best of my best jobs.
I grew up working as a young employee in Washington, D.C., because I had faith because I heard in Illinois, "It's been so hard to get here, but this election is going to change America."
But when the National Assembly failed to function and the whole country came to pass, I realized that hope and change felt like a cruel joke, and that the second coming of the political Saviour could not save me.
I knelt before the altar of the American Dream and prayed to the God of this age, to the God of Success, the God of Power.
But I kept my eyes open in the middle of the night and saw that all these gods were dead.
In the midst of my despair, I began to look again, not because I was brave, but because I knew I was at a crossroads, either believing or dying.
So I went on a pilgrimage to another holy place, to the Harvard Business School, and this time I knew I just couldn't accept the salvation that I claimed was true.
But I knew I had more work to do.
It started in the dark corner of a crowded party, in the late night of a miserable Cambridge early winter, in a question I had with three friends: a young man looking for the truth, and there was one thing that had long been asked: "What if I went on a trip in a car?"
We didn't know where we were going, but we had to go.
Because we've spent our entire lives, like Jack Kerouak's novels, " sneaking out at night and disappearing somewhere," and we've been trying to figure out how people live all over the country.
So other people said the risk was too great and the evidence was weak, but we left anyway.
In the summer of this year, I traveled eight thousand miles across the United States, through a rander in Montana, through a desert in Detroit, across a swamp in New Orleans, and worked with people there, who were working through small businesses to align the basic lines of life.
And I was struck by this innovative look at Western capitalism.
And this has grown in mind, and I've evolved into a non-profit, MBAs Across America, a movement that I've been standing on today.
This movement has spread because our generation is deeply longing for purpose and meaning.
The movement has spread to a lot of business people all over the United States, creating jobs and changing lives, and they need a little help.
But to be honest, this movement has spread because I've been fighting.
I've tried to go anywhere to spread this gospel so that more people can believe that we can sew up this torn country one by one.
But the journey to spread this gospel has brought me to another gospel, which I want to share with you today.
About a year ago, one evening at the Natural History Museum in New York, there was an alumni event at Harvard Business School.
There was a real-size whale model, and I was sitting down with the big men of our time, and they were celebrating their accomplishments with their colleagues.
It was full of pride, because the net worth and wealth that we operated under the management team had surpassed five hundred billion dollars.
It was great to see what we have achieved together.
But another thing happened two days later, and I went to Harlem to preach the gospel, and I sat there on a city farm that was once a vacant lot, and I heard a man named Tony talk to me about the children who came out there every day.
All of these children were living in extreme poverty.
I carried everything that a lot of kids had in their bags so that I wouldn't lose them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them participate in Tony's Harlem Grown to solve the only meal of the day.
Tony said he started brushing off his pension with Harlem Grown, a pension that he had been driving for twenty years.
He said the reason he confided his pension was because the program was successful but needed sponsorship.
He said he would be happy to get any help.
And I helped with that.
But as I broke up with Tony, my eyes were tingling and I felt tears go down in my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation, a revelation that one day, in a room, with hundreds of millions of people with five hundred billion dollars, and two days later, in another room, only fifty blocks away, someone was giving up his pension and watching him feed him.
I'm not in tears because of the obvious inequality, I'm not in tears at the thought of hungry children floating on the road, not in anger at the top 1% or pity for the other 99 percent.
The reason I was heartbroken was because I realized that in this country where kidney transplants are needed, I'm just a diabetic.
I realized that my story was being replaced by people who were encouraged to wear boots without boots, that I was taking the place of structural systemic help that didn't reach Harlem, Apalachia, New Orleans, and that my voice was taking over the voice of people who couldn't learn, couldn't wash, who didn't have a place to live.
And then the shame began to creep in, the same shame that Peter Gennings felt when he sat in front of the TV and cried out again and again for the new thousand years.
I was sloping, blindfolded and confused.
But this time, the false savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from that altar that night, when I thought the world was going to end, in the world that people were telling, suffering is God's necessary act, and what is written in the Bible is absolutely the truth.
Yes, I went a long way and I went back to where I started.
Simply because we can't say that we live in an age of mistrust, today we have as much faith as countless others before us.
Some of us believe the prophecies of Brene Brown or Tony Robbins.
Some of us believe in the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review as the Bible.
You can believe the most deeply when we gather here at TED churches to worship, but we have to believe and believe in earnest.
We're promising to solve all our problems, like charismatic leaders.
We see suffering as the necessary evil of capitalism that we believe in, and we accept that the development of technology is an irrefutable truth.
And we hardly realize the human cost when we don't have this little question, because we're afraid of shaking our entire base.
But if you're heartbroken by the absurd things we've come to accept, it's time to question.
I'm not talking about the gospel of collapse, reform, or new corporate performance metrics.
I'm not here today to preach the gospel of faith to you.
I came to preach the gospel of doubt.
The Gospel of Doubt is not telling you not to believe, but to tell you to believe new things, that it is possible not to believe.
The answer we have may be wrong, and the people who believe it may be wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt is that all of us here may be wrong.
Because this gospel raises the question, "Why?"
The question we put together with all our hearts, why do people still have to suffer like this?
This suspicion forced my organization, MBAs Across America, to close.
We're going to let our employees go, we're going to close our doors, we're going to share our business model for free, so that anyone who has the ability to do this can do it without our permission.
This suspicion led some to give up the role of the Savior that I had entrusted, because our lives were too short and unlikely to await the return of the Savior, in fact, in a situation where there are no miracles in the world.
And this doubt will give me strength and hope, when the way that lies before us seems to lead us to the end when we are overwhelmed by worry, when our healers can no longer heal our wounds, not our blind faith, but our humble doubts become a little light in our lives and in the darkness that is spread out in the world, and we raise our voices and whisper, or we can't heal our wounds anymore.
I'm going to make it sound like, or I'm going to make it say, "There's going to be another way."
Thank you.
Food poverty
It appears every day in the news.
What's the problem?
While there is a shortage of food in the world, there are too many.
GMOs are saving the world.
Maybe GMOs are a problem?
Excessive agricultural waste water pollutes the ocean. Soil nutrients are reduced, and soil waste is reduced.
The vicious cycle continues.
And when you look at this, it's very powerful.
How can I feel this situation on my skin?
How is this apple food-stricken?
You may have recently received an apple.
How long do you think this apple has been out of for some time?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11months. That's the average age of apples sold in marts in the U.S.
No part of the world is going to be very different, and then we put in chemicals, and there are real cases where we've lost our lives, because the chemicals that are used in the process of slowing down the deginering of apples are also harmful to the human body, and how come no one knows this?
Why didn't I know?
When we eat these apples, we lose about 90 percent of the nutrients, including antioxidants.
This apple is just a lump of sugar.
How can this be information deficiencies? How can we do better?
What we lack is a platform.
When I was a kid, computers and computers connected me to the Internet.
I've done a lot of weird things on this platform, and I've been able to meet people and express myself.
How do you describe yourself in food?
If we have a platform, we can ask autonomous questions. What if?
I asked this question: What if climate was equal?
This is a map of the global climate.
The most productive areas are green and the opposite is red.
The climate has changed. California farmers have now turned into Mexican farmers.
China wants to buy land in Brazil and grow quality food, and we rely heavily on climate.
What if every country had the best climate?
How will it change our lives?
How will it affect the quality of life and the quality of food?
The previous generation's food shortage was cheaper and needed more food.
Welcome to the International Farm.
We built a large analog farm.
The lines shown above are the transport routes for cars, planes, trains, etc.
It is a miracle that very few of society participate in agriculture to feed seven billion people.
But if...
Building a digital international farm?
What if this apple could be digitized and transmitted into the air and reconstructed on the other side of the world?
What if?
The quote I'm going to introduce to you in the future inspires me to do what I do.
First: ["Japan's agriculture has no water, no land, no young blood, no future."] This is an uncomfortable truth that I came face to face with my arrival in Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the catastrophe.
The young people went to Sendai and Tokyo, where the land was polluted and the food was about 70% foreign.
However, this phenomenon is not limited to Japan.
Only 2% of the U.S. participates in agriculture.
How can 2% of the population be able to do this?
Other regions are no better, and 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
80% don't want to be a farmer.
Farming is hard.
The lives of small farmers are miserable.
Young people go out into the city.
In India, members of farmers are not guaranteed a minimum of infrastructure, and in the last decade, the suicide rate of farmers is higher than ever.
It is an uncomfortable truth to put in your mouth.
Where are people heading?
It's a city.
There are no young people in the farmhouse.
How do we make this platform move young people?
It's a new tractor.
It's my harvest season.
A few years ago I stopped at Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot to start making stuff.
I made stupid things, I danced plants, I connected to my computer, I killed them all, many times.
And then I had the most intimate relationship in my life with plants, because I was learning their language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
"There's an old electronics room here that no one wants.
Make good use of it," he replied.
I built a farm in it with my team, where it had nothing to do with biology, and it was within 18.3 square meters.
It's not that much, but we've produced a single meal for three hundred people a month, and it's got some interesting technologies in it.
The most interesting part?
Beautiful, white root dark green leaves and a single month of harvesting
Is this a new restaurant?
A new retail experience?
A new supermarket?
One thing I can say is that the Media Lab people have uprooted something for the first time.
It's not so strange to eat a salad in a bag.
If you're rooting for video-based processing professionals, data scientists, and robotics engineers, you're going to think of each other like this: "Well, maybe I can contribute to this.
No, I want to try it." And in the meantime, we took some of the plants back to the lab, because what you grew up was precious, and you couldn't afford it.
I had a delicate taste, because I wanted my plants to be delicious.
This is because we eat lettuce before others every day. Now, just by taste, we can match the pH of lettuce in the range of 0.1.
"This is a pH of 6.1. I can't eat it today."
This beat was very sweet.
Because this plant was stressed and caused a chemical reaction to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!"
The resistance to living plants is sweet to me.
Instead of relying on the latest technology, we went back to plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to try this.
I want to see the infinite imagination, so I've conceived and put it into practice, a lab that can ship anywhere.
The front of this media lab is my lab, which utilizes thirty sensors per plant abandonment.
If you know a genome or a genetics, isn't that a penome?
One phenomenon
If you're saying "I like strawberries from Mexico," it's a more accurate claim that strawberries grown in that climate are good.
If you can code the climate, this CO2, O2 is the right prescription, and it's going to be coding the nutrition and climate, the size and the shape, the color and the texture of the plants you're trying to grow.
To do this, we need data that can analyze what's going on, and that's why we've attached a large amount of sensors.
Take a look at your plants: "Why are you dying? Why can't you talk?"
You will be saddened by this, and the farmer will have the eyes of the most beautiful prophet.
When they're in their 60s and 70s, they're either nitrogen-deficient or calcium-deficiency.
You can see if you need more humidity.
This wisdom does not follow.
This is the new eye of the cloud environment.
We look for trends in data that we gather over time and find associations with individual plants.
These figures are the IP addresses of all the broccoli served on a buffet day.
Now is the time for broccoli to have an IP address.
If you are ready to be even more surprised, you can click to see the profile of that plant.
It shows the growth of that plant, but it simply does not show when it is ripe.
Have I achieved the nutritional conditions I want
When do you get the taste you want?
You are getting too much water.
You get too much sunlight.
It's an alarm about all of this, and the plants speak to me.
Our own language has arisen.
Maybe that plant is the first user of Facebook, and that plant is going to start making friends.
I'm serious, that plant is going to be friends with plants that need less nitrogen and less potassium, but they're more phosphorus-demanding.
Now, we're going to find out about a complex connection that we can only guess about, and the results will vary depending on how we do it.
This is my current lab.
Now I'm a little bit of a system, and I know a little bit about the controlled environment, thanks to my career in designing medical data centers.
So we're doing a lot of different experiments in this environment.
This spray light process was also developed by NASA to reduce the water it sends to the Mir space station.
This process allows plants to deliver what they want to the right place: water, mineral resources and oxygen.
The roots are not that picky, and if you just meet them, you have a beautiful reaction.
It's like having two hearts.
That's why it grows four to five times faster.
It's the perfect environment.
We've been developing seeds that overcome adverse conditions for a long time, and that effort will continue, but we've also developed a new weapon called the faultless environment, the plant that we've tried.
It's a tomato that's never been commercially grown for a hundred and fifty years.
Do you know the bank that holds all kinds of seeds?
Seed Bank
It's a great place.
There's a lot of conservation of raw materials there, and there's a lot of things that you've never eaten before.
I'm the only one in this room who's ever eaten tomatoes like that.
The problem is, this tomato is for sauce, but we can't cook it, we eat it as a suboptimal solution, and it's just that.
I've also grown so many different things through protein modification.
I raised people, and of course I didn't.
What we realized during the experiment was that this device was too big and too expensive.
It cost about a million dollars per piece to install in different parts of the world.
There's not a lot of people who can spend a hundred thousand dollars at any time, so we wanted to make it smaller.
In fact, this project belongs to my undergraduate Camille, who is a mechanical engineering major, so Camille and my team spent the summer thinking about how to make cheaper, more performanceable products easier.
And we installed this machine in grades 7 and 11 of several schools.
Teach children to feel humble.
One time, I asked the students, "Let's set the humidity to 65 percent."
I became a seventh-grade student, and I said, "What's the humidity?"
"Humidness is water in the air."
"There's water in the air, man."
So I advised, "Yeah, don't trust me."
What else do you trust me?
Set the humidity to a hundred.
What happened when the child changed his settings?
The gas condenses, the water vapor flounders, and the water droplets at the end.
And he said, "Oh, the humidity is rain."
"Why didn't you tell me that?"
The interface we created is similar to online games.
Users can access the 3D environment from anywhere in the world. Smartphones and tablets are also available.
The user adjusts the physical environment and sensor of this machine garden.
You can choose the cultivation method made by different children all over the world.
And activate that cultivation method and plant seeds.
You can also make changes during the growing seeds.
"Why do you need carbon dioxide, isn't it bad for your body to kill people?"
They could raise the carbon dioxide level and kill plants.
It can also lower the level so that the plant grows well.
Once you have grown the plant, a new digital cultivation method is completed.
This process is a continuation of development and exploration. And the user is the one they produced.
You can download digital cultivation methods and data, and you can compare them to what's more advanced than before. All of this is just beginning. We're going to learn a lot.
That's the food computer. Three weeks have passed in each school.
It's been growing so far.
But more importantly, I instilled my first thought in this child, saying, "I want to be a farmer," or "I want to be a farmer."
We've open-sourced all of this.
Everything is on the web, so make it on time.
It won't be easy.
We're just getting started.
It’s so important to me that anyone can participate more easily.
It will make it easier.
It's farmers. Electronics engineers, mechanical engineering engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists plant scientists, economists, urban designers
They do what they do well on one platform.
And then the size grew too big.
This is a new facility that I just started.
It can be installed anywhere in the world.
That's why I chose this method.
In this warehouse, we're going to make something like this.
These things already exist.
These already exist.
The first is plants.
The second facility is cultivating the Ebola vaccine.
This is one of the reasons why the Drafa Grand Challenge winner and the plants you just saw are ahead of humanity in the Ebola virus.
These plants produce proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
Pharmaceuticals, medicinal products and lettuce
As if they were different in my field.
Everything is different.
This is a field that says, "That's fine, isn't that good?" There's a small mess, and they're proud of each other's products, and they say, "I'm very expensive, and I'm very interested in intellectual property.
Not that, but mine.”
But the reality is, we're just getting started.
It's also a time when society is changing rapidly, and in the past, if it was cheap, if it was a lot of food, it would be a very expensive time.
Now you need quality, eco-friendly food, and it won't be strange to be ranked as the number one most mysterious food in the world.
We've entered an era of advertising what McDonald's Chicken Mac Nugget is made of, and everything is changing.
In the future
Personal food computer food server and food data center operating as open penom
Like Wikipedia, who adds climate-specific cultivation and how does it shape society?
Do you remember the diagram I showed you?
In the future, there will be points instead of lines.
It is not about delivering food itself.
I'm going to send food information, and this is not my imagination.
It's already on the way to the human race: food computers, servers, and
The planned food data center will connect people with the wrongs of the current system.
Blaming each other is not the future of food.
We already know what went wrong.
The future of food supply is to connect the next generation of farmers to the platform, empowering them, asking each other questions, "What if?"
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel really embarrassed as a European.
In the past year, millions of people in need of our help have arrived in Europe, and our response has been frankly pathetic.
There's a lot of contradictions.
We mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Cody, but even then more than two hundred children continued to drown in the Mediterranean.
We have an international treaty, which recognizes refugees as a common responsibility, and yet we have accepted that small Lebanon accommodates more Syrians than all European countries.
We are mourning the presence of human smugglers, but we are making it the only way to exile into Europe.
We're going through a labor shortage, but we're blocking people who need the economy and the population from coming to Europe.
We're asserting the value of freedom against Islamic fundamentalism, but we have a policy of coercion, detaining children who want asylum, keeping children separated from their families, and confiscating the property of refugees.
What are we doing?
Why are we so inhumane in the face of a humanitarian crisis?
I don't think people are interested, not at least I don't want to believe that.
I think it's because our politicians don't have vision. We have no vision of changing the international refugee system that was created more than fifty years ago and how to apply it to an internationalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very fundamental questions, the questions that we all need to answer.
First, why is the current system not working?
Second, what do we need to do to fix this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of World War II, by these people.
The basic goal of this is to ensure that when the state fails, or in the worst case, turns its back on its own people, it ensures that people go where to go, and that they live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It was created today for the same situation as Syria.
Through international agreements signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Agreement on refugee status and the United Nations Refugee Agency, an international body, agreed to mutually accept those who have fled from physical conflict and abuse on their territory.
But today the system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In fact, our immigration policies are blocking the way to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to be accepted or to return to their country.
But in reality, they are stuck in an uncertain situation with no end in sight.
In theory, refugees are the world's common responsibility.
In fact, the demographics show that countries close to conflict zones are overwhelmingly accepting the vast majority of the world's refugees.
This system is not broken because the rules are wrong.
Because we haven't applied it properly to a changing world, and that's what we need to rethink.
So I'm going to give you a brief let me tell you how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
I will not say it from the institutional point of view from above, but from the point of view of refugees.
Let's think about a Syrian woman.
I'll call her Amira.
To me, Amira symbolizes many people I've met in the area.
Amira is a woman with children, as about 25 percent of the world's refugees do, and she can't go home, because it's from this city, and as you can see from the screen, the beautiful and historic city of Holmes is now covered in a pile of stones.
Amira cannot return.
But Amira can't even have a desire to resettle in a third country, because it's a lotto lottery that is only allowed to less than 1% of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three choices.
The first option is to take your family to the camp.
You can get help in the camps, but there is little hope for Amira and her family.
The camp is in a desert area almost desert, which is bleak and dry.
In Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp, you can hear the sound of shells across Syria's border in the middle of the night.
Economic activity is limited,
The quality of education is also low.
And about 80 percent of the world's refugees living in camps have to live there for at least five years.
That's why only 9% of Syrians actually choose camps.
Instead, Amira could head to urban areas of neighboring countries like Aman and Beirut.
This is how 75% of Syrian refugees have already chosen.
But there are huge challenges there, too.
Usually, refugees do not have the right to work in such urban areas.
There is no particular way to get help.
So Amira and her family spend the rest of their money and face little or no living in poverty.
So there's a third alternative, which is what a lot of Syrians have been choosing lately.
Amira can entrust her life to a very dangerous and difficult journey to another country for her family, and this is what we see in Europe today.
The world is driven by three choices that are almost impossible for refugees: camp life, urban poverty, and dangerous travel.
For refugees, that choice is a global refugee remedy today.
But I think this is the wrong choice.
I think we need to rethink this choice.
The reason we limit our options is because we think that's the only way refugees can take, but we don't.
Politicians define this as a zero-sum issue, which means that if you benefit refugees, they're going to cost their citizens.
We see refugees as an inevitable expense, or a burden on society.
But it's not, they can contribute too.
So what I'd like to argue is that there's a way to broaden the options for refugees, but also to benefit everyone, to the host countries and to the organizations, to our communities and to our refugees.
And what I'd like to suggest is four ways to change the paradigm of dealing with refugees.
These four methods have one thing in common: all of this is to take advantage of globalization, liquidity, market opportunities, and to divert our thinking on the refugee issue.
The first thing I want to think about is the provide environment, and this starts with the basic perception that refugees are people like us, who are just people in a special environment.
I worked with a colleague from Oxford on a research project in Uganda to observe the economic lives of refugees.
The reason we chose Uganda is not on behalf of the host country.
Uganda is exceptional.
Unlike the vast majority of the world's host countries, what Uganda has done is provide economic opportunities for refugees.
It gave me the right to work, it gave me freedom of movement.
And the result was enormous for both refugees and society.
In the capital, Kampala, we saw that 21 percent of refugees were in the business of hiring other people, and 40 percent of the employees were Ugandans.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs for the citizens of the host countries.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional cases that were vibrant and thriving business of entrepreneurship.
For example, we also saw a case of Congolese refugees running a digital music business in a residence called Nakivale.
In addition, one Rwandan refugee was running a business that would use recycled TV and game consoles to help children play computer games.
In the face of extreme constraints, refugees were innovating, and this gentleman in front of you was a Congolese man, called Demoke, who was a Congolese, and he was a Congolese, and he was a Congolese.
Demokei wanted to become a filmmaker, even though he came to his residence almost empty-handed.
So I started a local radio station with friends and colleagues, and I borrowed a video camera and now I'm making a movie.
He made two documentaries for our team, and he made a successful business with almost nothing.
This is an example that could change our response to refugees.
We need to not just see refugees as being dependent on humanitarian aid, but as opportunities to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothes, blankets, shelters, food are all very important factors in emergencies, but we need to look beyond that.
We need to give them opportunities: connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, capital and finance.
In the global economy, everything we take for granted can and should be applied to refugees.
The second thing I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all of the world's host countries are doing the same thing as Uganda.
The majority of the country is not opening up its economy to refugees.
But there are still practical alternatives that we can take.
Last April, I visited Jordan with my colleague, while I was there with development economist Paul Corriller, and I came up with the idea of an international community and with the government, supporting Jordan's national development strategy of providing jobs to Syrians, and I was working with them to help them develop their jobs.
The idea is to be able to potentially integrate employment in refugees and employment in Jordan, a host country, as a matter of economic zones.
Just 15 minutes from the Zaatari refugee camp, the home of 83,000 refugees is the existing economic zone, called the King Hersen bin Taral Development Zone.
The government spent more than a hundred million dollars to build a network of electrical facilities, a road network, but two things were lacking: labor accessibility and internal investment.
What if refugees could work there, to support their families and gain skills through vocational training rather than being confined to camps, until they went back to Syria?
That would benefit Jordan, because Jordan's development strategy is demanding a leap into middle-class countries through manufacturing.
Not only can this benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to the restoration of Syria after the conflict, through the recognition that we must embrace them as the best resource for Syria's reconstruction.
We published this idea in the Diplomatic Journal,
King Abdullah has adopted our idea.
It was announced two weeks ago at the Syria conference in London and will be piloted this summer.
The third idea I'd like to propose to you is to match the preferences between the country and the refugees, and it's going to lead to happy results, like here's a picture of Chancellor Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
We rarely ask refugees what they want and where they want to go, but I have to ask this and I want to argue that this can benefit everyone.
The economics book Alvin Ross developed the idea of a matching market, a way to match the preferences of the parties.
My colleagues, Will Jones and Alex Tittelboim, have studied whether the idea applies to refugees, to rank their favorite destinations for refugees, and to match them in technology and language standards to countries.
Of course, some tolerance for diversity and vulnerability is necessary here, but it is still a way to increase the chances of matching.
Matching ideas are used in many places, for example, to match students and university districts, to match patients with kidney implants, and to the algorithms of dating websites.
What if we applied this to the grave choice of refugees?
It's applicable at the national level, of course, to convince communities to accept refugees, which is a great challenge that we're facing.
And at that moment, for example, in our country, we often send engineers and farmers to rural and urban areas, which is really crazy.
Therefore, market matching is a way to ask for preferences, and a potential way to meet the needs and needs of refugees as well as in the host country.
The fourth or more I want to tell you is a humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and disruptions seen in Europe can be prevented.
This stems from the fundamental contradiction of the European asylum policy, so to speak, to defect to Europe, we have to voluntarily embark on the very dangerous journey that we mentioned earlier.
But why travel like this, in this day and age with low-cost aviation and modern consular power?
It's a really unnecessary trip, and more than 3,000 people have lost their lives on the European border and on European territory in the last year.
If refugees could travel directly to Europe, if they could find asylum, we could have done something with what's called a humanitarian visa, where people would get visas from embassies or consulates around the country, and they could buy a boat ticket to Europe.
If you want to get from Turkey to the Greek island through a smuggler, you have to pay €1,000.
From the Bodrum to Frankfurt, it costs 200 euros.
Allowing refugees to do so would have a clear advantage.
It could save lives, it could limit the smugglers' market, it could wipe out the chaos on the European front lines like the Greek island.
What prevents us from doing so is not a rational solution, but politics.
And here's an applied idea.
Brazil introduced a pioneering approach, issuing humanitarian visas to 2,000 Syrians, allowing them to enter Brazil and granting them refugee status.
Thanks to this system, all Syrians have obtained refugee status and are recognized as pure refugees.
There is also a historical precedent for this.
Between 1922 and 1942, the Nansen passport was used for travel, and 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens were allowed to travel to Europe and received refugee status anywhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Refugee Agency received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its effective strategy.
So the four ideas that I've talked about are ways we can increase Amira's options.
It's a way to give refugees more choices, just like I said, to benefit everyone, as I said, over three choices that are so basic and almost impossible.
In conclusion, we really need a new perspective, a vision that can increase the choice of refugees, a vision that we don't need to recognize refugees as a burden.
When it comes to refugees, everything is possible.
Of course, they're humane, but they're people who have the skills, the talent, the inspiration, the ability to contribute, and of course, if they help us do that.
In the new world, migrant is not something that leaves forever.
What we've seen in Europe won't last long.
People will continue to travel, they will find new settlements, and we need to find a rational and realistic way to do this, not based on the old theory of humanitarian assistance, not on the theory of charity, but on creating opportunities, on globalization, on the market, on mobility.
I want to call on all of you and the politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
The ocean was a wild world full of colors and life, home to strange-looking, fantastic creatures.
I photographed a large shark that reigned the food chain and saw elegant sea turtles dancing across the reef.
Being a marine biologist and a photographer, I spent most of my career looking for the fantastic place I dreamed of as a kid.
As you can see, I've been experiencing the water world since I was quite young.
When I first went to the deep sea, I was only ten years old.
I still vividly remember the fierceness of the raging to reach the old, hard cannons on the coral reefs.
When I finally got my cannon in my hand, I looked up and realized that it was surrounded by colorful, iridescent fish.
That day I fell in love with the sea.
For forty years on this planet, I have had the great privilege of working for the National Geographic Monthly and the Save Hours Foundation to explore some of the most beautiful ocean views.
I've photographed a lot of creatures, from very, very large sharks to squishy sharks that fit in the palm of your hand.
In the cold waters in front of Canada's Great Bear rainforest, I smelled the fishy mouth of a black-eaked whale feeding in front of me.
I've also seen the mating rituals of blue sea turtles in the Mozambique Strait.
Everyone on this planet is affected and affected by the ocean.
And the natural sea that I dreamed of as a child is becoming more and more difficult to find.
They are under increasing pressure and threatened.
I have seen and photographed the ramifications of human beings, protecting the place of the leading predators on the planet.
For quite some time, I thought, we're going to have to show the audience shocking pictures to wake up from indifference.
Although this approach has its advantages, it has returned to its origin.
The best way to make a difference is to make love.
Maybe I'm a type of matchmaker and photographer, and I have a rare opportunity to reveal the animals and ecosystems that are hidden beneath the sea level.
Without even knowing it existed, we cannot love and defend anything.
Revealing the beauty of nature is the power of environmental protection photography.
I've visited hundreds of marine locations, but only a few that impressed me deeply.
The first time I fell into such a tractic was about a decade ago on a rocky, wild coast in South Africa.
Every year in June and July, giant sardines migrate north, called sardine running.
These fish have a good reason to run away.
They are being chased by a swarm of hungry, sleek predators.
True dolphins hunt together, they separate some sardines from the main herd, turning them into a mass of bait.
The dolphins are kept in fish, leared to sea level, and then predated the feast table.
There is a shark behind.
Many people think that sharks and dolphins are enemies of the crippled sky, but the two coexist in sardines running.
In fact, dolphins help sharks predate more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait mass becomes more dispersed, and sharks often fill their stomachs with what I call sardine doughnuts, and their mouths are filled with water.
There have been a few dangerous moments with sharks in sardines running, but they don't see me as prey.
But at this noisy banquet, I bumped or tailed like any other guest.
On the coast of Africa, we cross the vast Indian Ocean and move east to the Maldives, an archipelago made up of coral reef islands.
And during the stormy southwest coast, the mats in the entire archipelago move to a small area in the Baa atoll called Hanifaru.
A herd of crustaceans that are not larger than their eyes is their main prey.
When the plankton density decreases, they feed on themselves, just like a dog chasing its own tail, they continue to turn on the flips.
But as the plankton density increases, the manta rays form this long food chain, and it's clear that the first or second matray-out prey will be eaten by the next manta rays.
At the peak of plankton levels in the bay, manta rays swim close to each other, exhibiting an unusual behavior that we call vortex feeding.
And while swimming in dense formations, the mats swirl themselves, sucking the plankton into their mouths.
This experience of swimming surrounded by swarms of matta rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, it wasn't protected and I was under threat of development.
Working with NGOs like the Manta Foundation, my pictures ultimately helped Hanifaru turn into a marine sanctuary.
Fishermen from neighboring islands who were hunting mats and rays to make traditional drums with their shells
And now they're the most ardent environmentalists, and the Maldives economy earns more than eight million dollars a year in income from manta rays.
I always wanted to travel back in time when most maps were empty or on the map were written "Dragons are alive."
And the closest I've ever had to this was on a remote coral island in the western Indian Ocean.
Diving into the water away from ocean routes and fishing fleets is a heartbreaking reminder of what our ocean once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Vasas da India, a small coral reef island in the Strait of Mozambique.
Corals form an external barrier for protection, and the inner chore is the relic of the Galapagos sharks.
These sharks never get too carried away even during the day.
I pretty much assumed that the sharks would become bolder at night.
I've never heard of so many sharks in a coral reef.
Sharing these moments reminds me why I chose this path.
Earlier this year, I went to Baja California for a challenge for National Geographic magazine.
And half way from the Pacific, there's the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is an important birthplace for ghost whales.
For a hundred years, the coast has been a place of carea. More than 20,000 ghost whales have died, leaving only a few hundred.
Today, the descendants of the surviving whales push their cubs to sea level, playing with us and even interacting with us.
This species has made a truly remarkable comeback.
On the other side of this peninsula is Cabo Pulmo, a slack fishing village.
Decades of overfishing led the town to collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded authorities to designate their coast as a marine sanctuary.
But what has happened since then has been close to a miracle.
After just a decade of protection, scientists have witnessed the recovery of the largest fish in history.
But don't believe me, come with me.
Let's swim together into the largest and denser fish I've ever encountered.
We can all be creators of hope.
And I'd like to share with my photography a lesson that there is still hope in our oceans.
In particular, I would like to pay attention to the resilience of nature that faces the seven billion people.
My hope is that in the future, it will be very difficult to take a picture like this, but I would like to take pictures that show that we and the ocean respect each other and coexist.
I hope it will be a good idea to take that picture.
If you want to survive and thrive as a marine photographer, you have to be a great optimist.
I always believe that the next great picture that will make a difference is nearby, and I'm going to be in the lagoon that's going to be faced next, or the next time we're going to see the coral that's going to be there.
When I came to Harare, Zimbabwe, the government was at the heart of national health policy.
After the long war of independence, a new government came into being, and the new government immediately instituted a socialist policy, free of health services, basic education.
The explosion of the number of health centers in the province has led to a huge increase in the number of people living within two hours of the health center's population.
In 1980, just after independence, only 25 percent of children were vaccinated.
In 1990, a decade later, that percentage increased to 80 percent.
I took great pride in this change and being part of the revolution.
I felt strong excitement and camaraderie with people.
Working with some of Zimbabwe's great scientists, doctors and activists, I felt I was in the field of the African independence movement and in the field of experiments in the global welfare movement, but there were also some difficult things.
When I first arrived in the 1985s,
The first case of AIDS infection has been reported in Zimbabwe.
I've been in charge of some of the AIDS patients for my medical studies, but it's hard to expect equal medical resources from Africa.
In the beginning, the infection rate was about 2 percent, and that figure was 17 years after I left Harare.
It has soared to one in four.
In the mid-1990s, I sentenced hundreds of people at the peak of my life to be AIDS-positive.
I've seen my colleagues, my friends, my students, my patients die.
As a countermeasure, my colleagues and I opened a clinic.
We taught them how to use condoms.
Education was also carried out in schools and workplaces.
We've also done research, and we've been counseling how our partners in the infected can protect themselves from the disease.
I worked hard and believed I was doing my best at the time.
As a doctor, I treated patients brilliantly, but I didn't insist on structural change.
Former UN President Kofi Annan has made a sincere statement about his mistake in calling the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994he was the UN's Director of Peacekeeping Operations.
In his 10th-period speech, he recalled: “I believed I was doing my best at the time, but when I looked back after the massacre, I realized that there were more things I could or should have done, and that I could inform and help in advance.”
Now that AIDS has destroyed the health system and the World Health Organization estimates that it has killed 39 million people, I also feel regret and regret for what I didn't do before.
Until I was in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as a policy endorsement or a political engagement.
I was there as an expert in medical and epidemiological technology.
What I thought in my mind was to take care of my patients and to better understand the path of the disease through research, to slow the spread of the disease.
I found that marginalized people in society were exposed to the threat of AIDS.
On sugar farms, which are more closed than any modern business, 60 percent of pregnant women have been infected with AIDS.
I tried to make it known that the fact of AIDS infection was not a moral depravity, but a male-dominated culture, a forced migrant labor, a colonization.
White people had a low infection rate.
As a health professional, the tools we were given were very poor: lifestyle changes, the use of condoms, the degree to which we recommend that we reduce same-sex companions.
Infection rates kept going up, and the most potent hope for treatment was developed in the West, but it was a lot of money to spread to Africa at a cost, and I think that's what caused this great tragedy, and that's what's causing this great tragedy, and it's been a very difficult time for the world to be able to
I didn't speak out on the question of the inequality of access to treatment, the problem of economic and political systems, and I justified my silence by justifying that I was only a guest of this country, that if I warned you, I would be deported, and if I did that, I would no longer be able to take care of patients or do any more necessary research.
So I've complied with the government's initial response to AIDS.
I didn't say my concerns loud enough.
Many doctors, health professionals, will think that it's not my fault.
The Hippocratic Oath, a contract with the patient, means the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
And I gave each of my patients everything possible.
But I knew that disease is a rift in our society, not just biology, but social disparity, marginalization, and discrimination in race, gender, class, and so on.
AIDS did.
So did the recent Ebola outbreak.
Paul Palmer, a medical anthropologist who studied AIDS in Haiti, calls this “structural violence.” The problem is that there are inequalities inherent in political and economic structures that are unconscious of vested interests in our society. The reason for this is that the consequences are as shocking as premature death, suffering, and disease.
Without this social injustice, the patient's treatment is secondary.
And to warn you about this is the first step to public health rights, and together we can solve problems and make real change, so today, I'm not quiet.
Even if those who listen are uncomfortable,
I say a lot of things, even if I'm uncomfortable with myself, and most things are racial polarization, or I'm not going to be able to do anything
It's about racism that's become commonplace, and it's something that shouldn't be in this country anymore, especially in the areas of medicine and public health.
But they're squeamish, and we don't care.
That's why it's New York's job as health chief to warn of the impact of racism on American health, to warn organizations that people of color have daily access to, and that violence by individuals leads to two hundred and fifty years of slavery, ninety years of racial injustice, and sixty years of imperfect equality in America's sad history, and that the rate of premature death in New York, the rate of death before the age of sixty, is the rate of premature death in New York City, the rate of death before the age of sixty.
Blacks are 50 per cent higher than whites.
In 2012, black women were more than ten times more likely to die in childbirth than white women.
And even though the infant mortality rate has gone down tremendously, black babies are still three times more likely to die in the first year than white babies, and New York is no exception.
These statistics are similar to those found across the United States.
The New York Times recently reported that one and a half million black men were missing across the country, and they were supposed to be located between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four.
One in six black men is in prison or prematurely killed, and young black men suffer from daily inequalities and unilateral violence.
It's great to see the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, a recent social movement, but at the same time, we're going to see the hardships of their suffering and the suffering of the people who are going to be able to do it.
As a result of numerous risk levels and the onset of major diseases, it's important to remember that heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS and other diseases slowly encroach on their lives and lead to premature death if they are severe.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I was disappointed and outraged that the medical community didn’t even use the word racism in research or work.
My feelings will be passed on to you.
Medical students often protest in their backs, but largely the medical community is silent on the impact of social discrimination on the spread of disease and death rates.
And I think about the fact that modern medicine is oriented toward, about personalization, to precision medicine, to develop biological or genetic therapies, that this movement is a side effect of the fact that the daily life we live, grow, work, and love has the greatest impact on public health, and that so many people are disadvantaged.
I'm afraid I'm going to forget. Every time I'm a health professional who works in my daily life, I'm going to do a lot of medical care, and I realize that I'm a homeless person who doesn't have a better life than I'm in her own life, that I can't follow prescriptions, that I'm transgender young who can't tolerate discrimination in our society, that I'm thinking about suicide, that I'm responsible for my own responsibility.
There were single mothers who felt that our role as health professionals was not just to treat patients, but also to warn them in advance and to call for change.
Right or wrong, our social status empowers our words, and we must not waste this power.
In regretting Zimbabwe's work, I was willing to warn as New York's health chief and pledge that I would spare no means of support for health equality, that I would be against racism, that I would be able to do it in a way that would allow me to do something about it.
I want your help, and I'm going to help you when you're trying to address sexism and other discrimination, and now we're going to get out of our seats and we're going to be able to do that.
It's time to come together to speak out on structural inequalities, and how we need to change that.
It doesn't have to be a case in point, just what we need is courage.
The health of our patients, and the health of all of us, depends on it.
Raise your hand to someone who has ever blocked someone on Facebook who has said nasty things about politics, religion, parenting, and food.
Do you have at least one person you want to avoid?
In the old days, if you wanted to have a respectful conversation, you could just say to Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady," "Just talk about the weather and the health."
But these days, because of topics like climate change and the anti-vaccine movement, those topics are dangerous.
The world we live in has the potential for all the conversations to be debated, where politicians don't talk to each other, and the smallest problems are passionately debated by someone, which is abnormal.
We studied ten thousand adult Americans at the Pew Institute, and now we are the most polarized and divided person in history.
It's less likely to compromise, it's less likely that you're not listening to other people.
Where do we live, who we marry, and who we make friends with, we decide based on the beliefs we already believe.
I don’t listen to other people.
Conversations need to be balanced between speaking and listening, but one day we've lost that balance.
To some extent, it is to blame for the development of technology.
We always have a smartphone or we can pick it up at any time.
According to the Pew Institute, one in three American teenagers send more than a hundred texts every day.
And most teenagers talk more by text than with friends.
I had a funny post on Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Banwell.
Mr. Banwell told students about certain topics.
I gave him the task of telling me to say it on the spot without writing anything on the note.
And Mr. Banwell said,
“I realized that the art of conversation is the most underrated and untaught.”
Children communicate on screens for hours every day, but they don't have much opportunity to clean up the conversational skills between people.
It may be a strange question, but let's ask ourselves. Are there any skills in the 21st century that are more important than talking logically and confidently?
I'm talking to people in my job: Nobel laureates, billionaires who drive trucks, head of state in kindergarten, plumbers...
I talk to people I like and people I don’t like.
I talk to people I personally don't agree with very much.
But have a good conversation.
So I'm going to tell you in the next ten minutes how to speak and how to listen.
Many of you have already heard the advice, for example, to look at your eyes and talk to me, or to preview an interesting topic, or to nod your head, or to smile and show that you're listening, or to follow what you just heard to say or summarize.
Forget all this advice.
It sounds like shit.
You don't have to learn to listen if you're really focused.
Even when I'm having a normal conversation,
I use the art of doing professional interviews, so I'm going to help you develop your conversation skills.
I'm going to teach you the art of interviewing people who don't want to be bored, who don't want to hurt you.
Learn to talk.
We've all had good conversations before, so we know what a good conversation is, it's immersive, it's inspiring, it's inspiring.
It's a conversation that feels really good or completely understood.
I don't want to talk about most of the conversations that you have, I'm going to tell you ten basic rules, and I'm going to tell you all the details, and I'm going to tell you all about it, and I'm going to tell you all about it, and
You can enjoy a much better conversation.
First, don't do many things at once, with your phone, your tablet, your car keys, whatever you have in your hand.
I'm not just asking you to put it down.
Be faithful in the moment.
Focus.
I had an argument with my boss earlier, and tonight's menu.
If you want to end the conversation you're having, don't focus on the ambiguity, get out of the conversation.
Second, don't preach.
If you only want to express your opinion, if you don't want to react, argue, refute, or grow, write it on your blog.
The reason I don't call commentators on my show is because they're boring people.
If you're conservative, you don't like Obama, you don't like welfare, you don't want abortion.
If you're a progressive, you don't like big banks, refiners and Dick Cheney.
It's completely obvious.
You can't do this.
Talk about always having something to learn.
The famous psychotherapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening is letting go of yourself.
This means that you may have to give up your personal opinion.
According to him, when the listener feels that the listener is embracing it, it becomes weaker and weaker and more persuasive.
Again, I think you always have something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everything you meet knows something you don't know."
In my words, everyone is an expert in some field.
Third, ask questions that you are free to answer.
Learn from the way journalists use it.
Start with the rules of the question.
When you ask a complex question, you get a simple answer.
If I ask you, "Are you afraid?"
You're going to respond to the most intense word in the question, "fear," and you're going to say "yes" or "no."
"You're angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let the responder describe it himself, he knows his feelings.
"How did you feel?" or "How did you feel?"
Ask.
And the person who answers will have to think for a moment, and he'll have a more interesting answer.
Fourth, follow the conversation.
When you have a thought in your head, it means you have to get rid of it.
In some interviews, guests talk for a few minutes, and then the host suddenly asks another question that's suddenly gone or that they've already answered.
It means that I was reminded of a very sharp question from the moderator, and I didn't listen to it anymore two minutes ago, and I just waited for the timing to ask it.
We do the same thing.
I remember sitting and talking to someone, and suddenly I met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
Then we stop listening.
It's going to come up with some buzz or some of the thoughts.
But you have to let it go.
Fifth, if you don’t know, you don’t know.
These days, people on the radio, especially on public television, know that what they're saying is recorded, so they're careful to say, 'I know for sure because I'm an expert in this field.'
Be careful too much.
The conversation should not be frivous.
Sixth, do not equate your experience with the experience of others.
When someone talks about the death of a family member, don’t talk about when you’ve lost a family member.
If someone says that your company is hard, don’t complain about your work.
It's never the same thing.
Every experience is different.
Above all, you are not the center.
You don't have to use that moment to be proud of yourself or be poised.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking how many IQs he had, and he said, "I don't know. “People who are proud of IQ are shit.”
Conversation is not an opportunity to be proud of yourself.
Seventh, don't say what you said, it's like you're being pretended to be bored, but we do it often.
Especially when you're at work or talking to your child, if you have a point that you want to talk to, you're going to repeat the same thing.
Don't do that.
Eighth, don't be obsessed with detailed information.
Frankly, the listener is not interested in the exact year, the name, the date, the details that you're trying to remember, and I'm interested in you.
I care about who you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details, you don't have to say it.
The 9th, not the last, but the most important.
Listen to me.
Many great people have heard that it is perhaps the most important skill you can develop, and the Buddha said, "If your mouth is open, you are not learning."
President Calvin Coolidge said, “No one’s been fired for a lot.”
Why don't we listen?
First, because we want to talk.
When I speak, I control the conversation.
You don't have to listen to what I don't care about.
I get attention
I can strengthen my identity.
But there's another reason. We're distracted.
A person speaks an average of 225words for a minute, but can hear up to five hundred words a minute.
So I'm filling in my head the other two hundred and seventy-five words.
I know it takes a lot of effort and energy to focus on other people, but if you're not focused, you're not talking.
It's just that two people are throwing unrelated sentences in the same space-time.
We need to listen to each other.
Stephen Kirby said,
"We hear not to understand, but to answer."
Finally, the tenth, be brief.
'Good conversation is a miniskirt. It's short enough to keep you interested and long enough to cover the subject.' - My brother, after all, the basic principle of all this is one thing.
I grew up under a famous grandfather and had a kind of ritual in my house.
When someone came to talk to my grandparents, she asked me who she knew.
“He’s Miss America.
He's the mayor of Sacramento.
He's a Pulitzer Prize winner, he's a Russian ballerina."
So I grew up thinking that everyone had something hidden.
I think that’s why I became a good host.
Keep your mind open without opening your mouth as much as possible, always be prepared to be surprised, and you will never be disappointed.
Do it too.
Go out and talk to people, listen to them, and be prepared to be most surprised.
Thank you.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I won several medals in three of the sports at the Canadian national championships, competed in international basketball competitions, and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I do five days of basketball and speed skating training every week, working with the best coaches and psychiatrists to make sure I'm the best in my sport.
All of this is possible through special Olympics.
Have you changed your mind about me and my accomplishments?
The world doesn't see people like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were supposed to be shunned and hidden.
Since the start of the Special Olympics in 1968, there have been a number of changes, but in most cases, intellectually disabled people are invisible to many people.
I don't think it matters when people use the word "c" in front of me.
The word is used in a way that insults and demeans people by saying, "Idiot," or "Idiot."
They don't think how much of a hurt they can be to me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here for a charitable purpose.
I'm here because there's still a lot of people who have a big problem with their view of the intellectually disabled, or if there's too many, they don't even recognize them.
Did you know that there was a World Cup this year?
I was one of more than 6,500 intellectually disabled athletes from 165 countries who had gathered to participate in the Special Olympics in Los Angeles.
More than 62,000 people watched the opening ceremony, and there were live broadcasts on the TSN and ESPN channels.
Did you know this happened?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I hope you and I, here today, look to us as equals.
Special Olympics change the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It also changes everyone's perspective, and for those of you who don't know,
The Special Olympics is a competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It's separate from the Paralympics or the Olympics, and we're going to have to change the quality of life and the eyes of people for the sake of the athletes with the intellectual disability.
This movement has changed not only my life, but also the lives of many others, and the world has changed the lives of people with intellectual disabilities.
It also changed the way you look.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
When I was a kid, I played hockey until I was twelve years old, and the bigger I was, the harder it was to keep up with the level of the other kids, and I was frustrated and angry.
I didn't do any exercise for a while, I didn't have many friends, I was lonely and sad.
There was a time when intellectually disabled people were hidden in society.
No one knew they were going to exercise, and no one knew they were going to be a valued member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the impact of general exercise on the health levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through thorough scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that the health level was reduced because of the lack of opportunities for children with intellectual disabilities to participate in exercise.
Many people doubted that many health programs and athletic competitions would benefit the intellectually disabled.
But Dr. Hayden and the founder of the Special Olympics, Euns Kennedy Shripper, have not caved in as pioneers, and the special Olympic athletes have proved four and a half million times that they were right.
Before I joined the special Olympics, I was very anxious, because I was young, timid, I didn't have confidence, I didn't have a lot of friends.
But as soon as I was on that stage, everyone encouraged me, supported me, and helped me to be who I was, regardless of what I saw.
I'm now a basketball player and speed skater, I've competed in a number of local and national competitions, and I've competed in the Los Angeles Summer Olympics this year, and I've been a basketball team for the first time in Canadian history.
I'm one of more than four and a half million athletes in the world, but I've heard a lot of similar stories.
Being a special Olympian restores our self-esteem and self-esteem.
Special Olympics also address important health needs.
Many studies have shown that on average, men with intellectual disabilities die thirteen years earlier than normal men, and women with intellectual disabilities die twenty years earlier than women.
Special Olympics keep us healthy by keeping us moving and getting involved in the movement.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
Furthermore, special Olympics offers free health check-ups to athletes who are difficult to communicate with their doctors or who have difficulty accessing health insurance.
At the Summer Olympics, my Canadian colleagues and I played against the Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, Nigeria's national team attended a health check-up of the World's World Games players, and seven out of ten players received free hearing aids so they could hear for the first time in their lives.
The change that came to them was huge.
They were more excited, happy, confident, because they were able to communicate with the director in words.
And I was thrilled to hear the sound of the basketball, the whistle, the cheering of the crowd -- because of these sounds that were so obvious to us.
Special Olympics doesn't just change athletes in one event.
It's changing their lives outside the stadium.
According to several studies this year, half of the adult population in the U.S. does not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans with intellectual disabilities and non-personally related individuals have much less respect for it.
And there's the word "ᄇ," which means that, to whatday, intellectually disabled people are invisible to so many people.
People use this word in small words and even swear words.
Last year, the word was mentioned on Twitter more than nine million times, and to me and my four and a half million fellow players around the world, it's a huge wound.
A lot of people think this is not offensive, but it is not.
My colleague and global messenger, John Franklin Stevens, responded publicly to a political expert who used the word "ᄇ" in profanity, "When are you going to join us at the Special Olympics?
Let's see if you can walk away without changing your mind. "
This year, at the Summer Olympics, people lined up to watch the weightlifting final for hours.
In the end, it was only a seat, and my proud colleague Jackie Barrett defied 297kg, lifting 277kg from squats, the best record in the history of the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the best-known all weightlifter in Newfoundland, not just in the Special Olympics, but in all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN updated his record on Twitter in real time, admiring his game.
Fifty years ago, not many people thought that intellectually disabled people would achieve that.
At this year’s Memorial Coliseum in Los Angeles, sixty thousand spectators filled the seats to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games, cheering for a number of athletes from 165countries from all over the world.
Far from being hidden, we were cheered, we were celebrated.
Special Olympics teach athletes to take pride in their self-confidence.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities are part of our society that deserves respect.
I now have dreams, achievements, great coaches, respect and self-esteem, and much healthier, and now I'm trying to be a personal trainer.
I'm no longer hiding or being teased, I'm here for a TED Talk.
Thanks to the special Olympics, the world has changed a lot, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet an intellectually disabled person, I want you to see his talent.
The next time someone around you uses the word "ᄇ," I want you to tell me how much of a hurt that little word is.
I hope you will join us for the special Olympics.
Let me say one last thing.
Nelson Mandela once said, “Sports have the power to change the world.”
Special Olympics are changing the world. By changing four and a half million players, we're giving us a place to stand more confident, meeting friends, not being appreciated, enjoying the feeling of a champion, and being a champion.
Thank you.
You may not have heard of Kenema or Arua.
But I know those two places as the strangest places on earth.
There are a community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have been quietly confronting humanity's greatest mortal threat for years: the Lhasa virus.
The Lhasa virus is very similar to Ebola.
It's severe, it's very deadly.
And yet they risk their lives every day to protect the people here, and to protect all of us.
But the strangest thing I learned about them when I first visited them a few years ago was that they start their day on the hard frontline with a song.
They gather together and share in the joy.
Show them their grit.
And over the years, when I visit them or they visit me, we get together, we sing, we write, we have fun, because we just want to make sure that what we're here to pursue science is that we're united by the tenacious humanity that Anara shares.
As you might think, that process has become so important and essential even when something has changed.
And in March, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea, it changed a lot of things.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, and the point was near the Sierra Leone and Liberian borders.
And I was very scared, we were all scared.
We actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than we thought, and that one day they would be in Kenema.
So the members of my research team were immediately dispatched to join Dr. Humarkan and his team, and we prepared a precision molecular diagnosis to ensure that Ebola crosses the border into Sierra Leone and is immediately visible.
We've already built this system against the Lhasa virus, and we know how to deal with it this time, and this team is very good.
We just had to give them the tools and the places to investigate Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23rd, a woman was admitted to a hospital obstetrician's gynecological unit, and her team performed an important molecular diagnosis to determine the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was a really great thing.
They were able to diagnose this case immediately and begin a contact tracing investigation to safely treat the patient and see what happened.
Maybe they could have stopped something.
But when that day came, Ebola was already breeding for months.
With hundreds of cases, we've already surpassed the diseases that have occurred in the past.
And it came in like a tile, not a single case in Sierra Leone.
We covered a number of cases in the international community, health and health, and kinema, and we covered 31 cases a week, then 92, then 147, all came to Kenema, the only place we could cover in Sierra Leone.
And we've been doing everything we can, trying to help people, trying to get attention, but we've done another simple thing.
From a sample from a patient's blood to discover Ebola, of course, you can discard it.
All we could do was put chemicals in, deactivate them, put them in a box and take them across the ocean, and we did that.
I sent my team to work in Boston.
We kept working every day, and we built ninety-nine Ebola genomes.
This was the blueprint of the genome of the virus.
We all have them.
It talks about everything that makes us, and it tells us a lot of information.
The results of these experiments are very simple and influential.
We could see and compare these ninety-nine different viruses, and we could actually compare the three genomes that had been on the outbreak in Guinea before, and we can show that it originated in Guinea a few months ago, and it infiltrated humanity, and it was transmitted to humans.
And that's very important, to know how to intervene, but more importantly, it's a contact tracing investigation.
We could see that the virus was spreading among people and was deforming.
And each mutation was very important, because there were multiple diagnostics and vaccines, the light of treatment that we were using, all of which were based on the sequence of genes that fundamentally moved the virus.
So global health professionals had to react, develop, and re-measure everything they were doing.
But the way science works at that point in time is that the data is going to be collected and spent months working in the containment chamber, analyzing the data very carefully and slowly, proposing and researching the paper to be published, and finally, when it was published, the data would have been distributed.
That's how the current situation works.
But it won't work at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines, and what we obviously needed was help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was we released the genome sequences to the web as soon as they were identified on the machine.
I posted it to the world and said, "Please help me."
And the help hand came.
Before we knew it, people from all over the world contacted us, and we were surprised to see the data.
At some point, the very great virus trackers joined our community.
We worked together in a virtual way, like sharing, regular phone calls, communication, trying to find ways to stop the virus.
There are many ways to create these communities.
In particular, as disease outbreaks spread around the world, everyone reached out to learn, participate, and engage in disease.
Everyone wanted to take on the role.
The amount of human capacity here is amazing, and the Internet has connected us all.
Instead of fearing each other, you say, “Let’s do this.
Can you imagine trying to work together?”
But the problem was with the data that we were all using, and Googlering on the web had a limit to what we had to do.
And when that happens, you miss a lot of opportunities.
In the early days of Kinema's pandemic, we had clinical records of 106patients, and we released this again to the world.
And in our lab, we were able to train computers to make access to 106 records and to predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with a hundred-per-cents accuracy.
And we've created an app to distribute it so that it can be used by the medical staff in the field.
But the number 106 was not enough to make it strong and acceptable.
So we're waiting for more data to be distributed.
Those data are still not coming.
We're still waiting in the isolation room, and we're improving instead of working together.
And we won't be able to accept this fact.
I won't be able to take it from all of you.
Our lives are at risk.
And the fact is, a lot of lives have been lost, including a lot of medical staff, including my beloved colleagues, five colleagues: Embalu Pony, Alex Moigboy, Dr. Humarkan, Alice Koboma and Mohamed Pullah.
These are five of the many medical staff who have died outside of Kennema and beyond, when the world is waiting, when we're all working, quietly, apart.
You know, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is exacerbated by distrust, dispersal, and division.
When we build a barrier that separates us from each other, and fight each other, the virus thrives.
But unlike all that threatens humanity, the place where we are all the same human being is Ebola.
We are all in this fight together.
Ebola disease in a family can be ours at any moment.
So with the same vulnerability, the same power, the same fear, the same hope, I hope we can work together with pleasure.
One of my graduate students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and I found that the word "Kenema," the hospital where we worked and the city where we worked in Sierra Leone, originated from the Mende word, "It's as clean, transparent as the river, and open to the public eye."
It surprised us all, because before we knew it, we always felt that in order to honor the people of Kenema that we worked for, we had to work, share, work together, openly.
And you have to.
We all have to demand from ourselves and others, and when a disease occurs, we have to speak to each other, to open our hearts and fight together.
This is because it's not the first outbreak of Ebola, and it's not the last one, and there's a lot of microbes waiting outside, and there's a lot of it outside, besides the Lhasa virus.
And the next time this happens, it can happen in more than tens of thousands of cities.
It could be an airborne disease.
It could be deliberately spread.
I know it's scary, but I know this, too, and this experience shows us that we have the skills and the ability to win it, and we have the upper hand in the virus.
But we can only achieve it together, and we have to do it with pleasure.
So for Dr. Khan, and for the countless people who have always sacrificed at the forefront of this fight with us, let's always be with them in this fight.
Let's not define it as a world destroyed by viruses, let's unite and shine through the hearts and minds of billions of people.
Thank you.
