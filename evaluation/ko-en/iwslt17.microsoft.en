This is a story about how we know what we know.
This is the story of this woman. Natalia Lipczynski.
She is a paleontologist. That is, she is an expert in digging up things that are dead a very long time ago.
Natalia Lipczynski: Yes, they call me "Dr. Dead."
Latif NASA: And what interested me about her was where she dug things up. She works in remote Canadian tundra regions well above the Arctic Circle.
On a summer day in 2006, she was at an excavation site called Fyles Leaf Bed. It is located less than 10 degrees from the North Pole to latitude.
Natalia: Did you? It wasn't a big deal at all. Because I was walking around all day, carrying GPS and laptop in my backpack and picking up anything that looked like fossils.
Latif: And at some point, she realizes something.
Natalia: It was rusty, rusty in color, the size of my palm.
It just fell to the ground.
Latif: At first, she thought it was just a piece of wood. That's because people have found fossils of prehistoric plants in the Fyles Leaf Bed before.
But that night, when I came back to camp,
Natalia: I took out my handheld magnifying glass and looked at it a little bit more closely, and then I realized. It doesn't look like it has tree rings.
I thought it might be something that should be preserved. But this is really
It looked like a bone.
Latif: So over the course of four years, she continued to explore the area. And in the end I collected 30 pieces of the same bone fragments. Most of them were really small pieces.
Natalia: It's not a big deal. If you try it, it all fits in one ziplock lock.
Latif: And she was trying to put the bones together like a puzzle.
But it was very difficult.
Natalia: It was so fragmented that I tried sand and bonding agents, but it didn't look good.
So, in the end, I shot it with a 3D scanner.
Latif: Oh! Natalia: yes, that's good, right?
Latif: It was actually a lot easier.
Natalia: It was magical to see the pieces come together.
Latif: How confident were you about whether the pieces fit together?
Was it possible that you didn't assemble it well? Isn't it a bone of a small parakeet or something else?
Natalia: Well, no. No, you did it right.
Latif: According to her, what she found was a tibia. This is the leg bone. And, precisely, the bones of the legs of mammals with cleft hooves. Animals like cows and sheep.
But it couldn't have been these two animals.
Because the bones were too big.
Natalia: It was really big, it was a very large animal bone.
Latif: And what kind of animal?
While she was thinking about it, she showed one of the pieces to a colleague in Colorado, and they gave her a good opinion.
Natalia: We cut it into pieces with a saw. And there was a really interesting smell coming out of it.
Latif: It smelled like burning flesh.
It was the smell she used to smell in her disgusting anatomy class. It smelled like collagen.
Collagen plays a role in the structure of bones.
And it usually falls apart over time.
In this case, however, the Arctic was preserved as a natural freezer.
A year or two later, Natalia saw a colleague of hers, Mike Buckley, demonstrate "collagen fingerprinting" at a conference in Bristol.
Its content is that different species have slightly different collagen structures. So if we have collagen structure in unidentified bones here, we can compare it to the structure of the species that has been identified. And who knows, maybe you'll find a match.
So she sent one piece to a colleague. FedEx.
Natalia: Yes, I'm going to confirm the delivery. It's important.
Latif: And he did an analysis and compared it with 37 known modern mammal species.
I found a match.
Investigations have revealed that the bones are 3.5 million years old, and that the owner of the bones that Natalia dug up from the Arctic Circle is...
It was a camel.
Natalia: At the time, I was like: You what? It's amazing -- if it's true.
Latif: So we did a test with the other pieces and they all got the same results.
However, the size of the bones found means that the camel found was 30% larger than a modern camel.
This camel is then 9 feet tall and weighs about 1 ton.
I do.
Natalia found a giant Arctic camel.
Now, when you hear the word "camel," this is what you might think. East Asia, the double-peaked camel of Central Asia,
You may have this dromedary camel in your head, which is usually seen on postcards. It is a typical desert animal that lives in hot desert areas. They live in places like the Middle East and the Sahara, where they have large humps on their backs to store moisture for long desert treks and use their large, wide feet to climb over the dunes.
So how did they end up on the Arctic Circle?
Well, scientists have known for a long time. What was revealed before Natalia's discovery was that the camel was actually from the United States.
It was here that the camels first appeared.
Camels first appeared about 40 million to 45 million years ago and only inhabited North America. It turns out that there were more than 20 species, and there may be more.
Latif: If you compare all the camels, can you tell them apart from each other?
Natalia: Yes, camels are different sizes.
Some camels have really long necks. It's actually a camel that looks like a giraffe.
Latif: Some species have crocodile-like snouts?
Natalia: The camels in the primitive stage were really, really small. It's almost like a rabbit.
Latif: What? A camel the size of a rabbit?
Natalia: Yes, it's a primitive camel.
Probably not a camel.
Latif: Oh my God, I'd love to have a rabbit camel.
Natalia: Me too. Sounds good, doesn't it?
LATIEF: And about 300 to 7 million years ago, a species of camel crossed over to South America. From there, they evolve into llamas and alpacas. Other species cross the Bering Viaduct to Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the Ice Age, the North American camel became extinct.
Scientists knew all this. But it didn't fully explain what Natalia had found far north.
For example, in terms of temperature, the polar regions are the complete opposite of the Sahara.
To be precise, 3.5 million years ago, on average, it was about 20 degrees Celsius warmer than it is today.
So the Arctic Circle would have been a boreal forest. It would have been like today's Yukon or Siberia.
But even so, it was an area where winter lasted for six months, and the puddles of water froze and
It must have been where the blizzard happened.
It would have been an area with polar nights that lasted for 24 hours.
How to... How?
How did this Saharan superstar survive the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her colleagues come up with one hypothesis.
And it was quite a brilliant idea.
What if what we think of as how camels can adapt to places like the Sahara is actually evolved to survive the winter? That's what it is.
What if the camel's broad feet were not meant to cross the desert, but to walk on snow? It's like a folktale.
If the camel's hump -- that was big news for me. What if it doesn't contain water, but it contains fat, and it helps you get through the six months of food scarce?
And what if, later, these features were adapted for the hot desert environment, so that the camels would overwinter long after crossing the Bering Viaduct?
For example, it will help in the back or in hot climates. That's because the fat in your body is concentrated in one place, so it's like a fat bag, so you don't need insulation to cover your whole body.
The hump on your back makes it easier to keep the heat out.
It sounds strange, but the essential reasons why camels can live in the desert can be evidence that camels lived in the Arctic Circle in the past.
In fact, I'm not the first to tell this story.
Others see this as a marvel of evolutionary biology or say it will be the key to future climate change.
But I love this story for a different reason.
I think that's the story of us. I think it's a story about how we look at the world and how it makes a difference.
I am a historian.
And I came to realize that many scientists are like historians.
Proving the past is the same.
Scientists also talk about the universe, the Earth, and life on Earth.
And as a historian, I've been thinking about where this story goes.
Natalia: We make hypotheses and we think they're true. It's like camels live in the desert. Isn't?
That's just right! I believed it completely.
As you can see, camels live in the desert.
Rataf: But at some point, you find the slightest piece of evidence.
In that little thing, everything you've known can be turned upside down.
In this case, a scientist discovers a piece of wood that was thought to be a tree, and with it, the scientific community has a completely new and counterintuitive theory about why this Dr. Seuss-like animal looks the way it is.
And for me, the idea of camels was completely turned upside down.
From ridiculously rare animals that can only grow in certain environments to animals that have traveled the world and arrived in the Sahara. In fact, it is not strange to be anywhere in the world.
This is Azzurri.
Hello Azzurri! How do you feel?
So here, eat this one.
Azzurri is currently taking a break from his regular performances. It's a show at Radio City Music Hall.
I'm not kidding.
Anyway -- the reason Azzurri is here is to let you know that the story of this world is mechanical.
It's something we need to adapt to and re-imagine.
Correct? Azuri?
And indeed, one small piece of bone has renewed the world as we see it.
I appreciate it.
Today's computers are so amazing that it's hard to notice how terrible they are at the same time.
Today, I'm going to tell you about some of the problems in computers and show you how to solve them with neuroscience.
First, let me tell you about an important incident that happened to me on a cold night in Harlem in 2011.
I was sitting in a bar on the outskirts of Columbia University. Here, I majored in computer science and neuroscience. I was in a bar with a friend having a conversation about how holograms would one day replace computers.
And just as our conversation was about to reach its climax, my friend's cell phone rang.
My friend pulled his phone down and looked down as he started typing.
He looked up at me with hard eyes and said, "Go on. I'm listening."
But there was no heat in my friend's eyes. The moment has already cooled down.
On the other side, another student took out his cell phone and held it out to the group.
He was flipping through the photos on Instagram and laughing happily with his group.
It struck me that I was offended, but at the same time, that I was happy over there because of the same technology.
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the content of the digital information itself did not lead to different outcomes, but simply the orientation of the screen separated me and my friend and the other side bonded together.
When they were bonded by cell phones, it was like our ancestors sitting around a campfire and talking to each other to develop their social skills.
I think that's how tools should work.
It should be an extension of your body.
And I think today's computers are just the opposite.
Whether you're emailing your wife, writing a symphony, or comforting a friend, you're doing the same on your computer.
Encounter squares and tap buttons and menus to bring up other squares.
I think that's wrong. I think you can use a much more natural machine.
We need to use machines that do things in the real world.
We need to apply neuroscience principles to machines to expand our senses, not run counter to them.
There is such a machine in this very place right now.
This one is Meta 2.
Let's give it a try.
I can see with my own eyes the audience in front of me and my hands.
Count three, two, one, and you'll see a realistic hologram. Right now, in front of me, in the form of a very realistic hologram, in front of the very device that I'm using right now.
These holograms are both the products we shop for and the objects we explore. And you can use your hands to make precise movements.
It's a sight that even Iron Man would be proud of.
We'll get back to this machine in a moment.
If you're like me, you're imagining what's possible with this technology. So let me show you.
My mother is an architect. Naturally, I thought of representing architecture in 3D. It's not a 2D blueprint like it is now.
Mothers touch on graphics and choose interior decorations.
This scene was actually filmed on Meta 2.
The next example resonates with me, Professor Adam Ghazali's Transparent Brain Project. Received the understanding of UCSF.
As a student of neuroscience, I always imagined learning and memorizing the complex structure of the brain with the help of machines. Playing with complex brain structures. This technology is called 'augmented reality'.
But I think it's a process of expanding the capabilities of our bodies with the help of machines. Not the other way around.
Now...
In a few years, humanity will undergo a great transformation.
Humanity will begin to layer the corresponding digital information on top of the physical world.
Imagine what a change this would make. Storytellers, painters, brain surgeons, interior decorators, for us here.
And I think we should all work together to discuss how to create this new reality through a lot of attempts and efforts, and think about how to expand the human experience, not just make it like a game or fill it with information.
And I'm very passionate about it.
Now, let me tell you a little secret.
In about five years, this is not a minimized device. In about five years it will be improved into a thin strip of glass projecting holograms onto the eye. And just as we choose a phone based on the operating system, not the hardware, as a neuroscientist, I've always dreamed of creating iOS for the mind.
The development of this OS should be done with great caution, because as long as we have used Windows, we may be living with the new OS for a long time in the future.
I don't know about you, but I'm afraid to live in Windows.
To find the interface that is most intuitive to the user, we put neuroscience at the core of our design, and you won't see it squeezed out of a conference room.
When we do design, the principle we always remind ourselves of is to find the "neural circuit with the least discomfort".
Every step of the way, we try to connect the iOS of the mind with the intuition of the brain. In other words, we're trying to create a computer that doesn't need a description.
We're building computers that you can use instinctively.
The following three design guidelines are designed for a new user experience.
That's what we're after. The first and most important is
You are the operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and unintuitive, forcing your brain to make additional comprehensions.
In other words, it does not go through the circuit with the least discomfort.
In augmented reality, on the other hand, you can put a holographic TED screen here and an email on the other side, or you can use the spatial power of the real world to pull holograms.
You can also take out the Tesla car you were shopping for. Only for models that have been agreed to by the legal team prior to the lecture.
It's good. The brain understands this process perfectly.
The second guideline is to call it "touch and see".
What do babies do when something gets their attention?
Reach out and try to touch it.
This is how a natural machine works.
It turns out that in order for a visual system to be very effective, it needs to have a sense of proprioception, that is, a feeling of where the body is in the system.
Therefore, being able to touch it directly not only improves the ease of operation, but also gives you a deeper understanding of the content.
It's about touching it.
But it's not enough to be alone.
We are social animals.
This is our third guideline. It's a holographic bonfire that ignites a story.
Mirror neurons in the human body allow us to see the faces and hands of others in 3D and immerse ourselves in what we are doing with them.
If you look at the video behind me, two Meta users are playing together with the same hologram and interacting with each other by making eye contact. It's not that the devices are causing us to fall apart.
With the neuroscience in mind, let's get back to the device.
We're back with iOS for the mind.
This time, I'm going to go a step further and hold this device in my hand and place it next to my desk.
I am with you. It is connected.
I can grab this device and put it back in place, depending on my spatial ability. I'm the operating system.
Now, with my proprioception working, I can break it down into thousands of parts and touch the very sensor that is scanning my hand.
But it's boring to watch it alone, so let's have a 3D call with our co-founder, Ray. Rei?
Ray, how have you been?
Guys, I'm looking at this man in 3D right in front of me.
It's like it's real.
I appreciate it.
My mirror neuron says that this feature will replace the phone in the near future.
Ray, how are you?
Sure. We're going live.
Ray, please present the holographic brain that you showed the audience here for the first time.
Ladies and gentlemen, this device will change not only the phone, but also the way we work together.
I appreciate it.
Thanks Ray.
What.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message I found in the bar in 2011. The future of computers isn't confined to a square screen.
It's right here, in us.
What I can tell you today is that natural machines are not futuristic sci-fi, they are in 2016.
Meta has already built this device, and hundreds of Meta's administration, executives, designers, and technologists are going to throw out all the monitors in the company before TED2017 and replace them with really, really natural machines.
Thank you very much.
I appreciate it. Thank you.
Thanks guys.
Chris Anderson: I have a question for you, we've had a couple of augmented reality demonstrations before until last year.
Each time, there was a debate among the technicians as to whether the demonstration was a real user's view.
It's a matter of viewing angle, and whether the demonstration video is more widely visible than what you actually see with the device.
Is it what you see in the video?
Meron: Not the same.
Not only that, but I made a lot of adjustments to shoot all the footage with the camera inside the actual lens.
We put a lot of effort into creating the video to make it feel like you're actually using a device when you watch the video.
Chris: Thank you for your attentiveness.
Thank you very much. It's rewarding.
I am from Seattle, Washington, one of the most liberal, tolerant, and progressive cities in the United States.
I grew up in a family that believed Seattle was the best.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a university professor. I'm so grateful for the nurturing I've received. I was able to design my life comfortably.
But the truth is, I didn't follow my parents' way of doing it.
As a nineteen-year-old, I dropped out of college, got kicked out, and was a nuisance.
I went to find the professor of my dreams, Professor French Horn.
I've played chamber music in the U.S. and Europe. I traveled with a great jazz guitarist named Charlie Bird for two years.
At the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
It's a wonderful life.
My parents never complained.
He gave me all the support.
It wasn't what they wanted.
My parents used to tell their neighbors and friends: "My son is in hiatus".
And there was a conversation about my life that was a little uncomfortable. I'd love to tell you about it.
I came back from Barcelona when I was 27 years old. It was Christmas, so I went to visit my parents. I was cooking in the kitchen with my mother.
She was so quiet.
Something was wrong.
I asked my mother. "Mom, what are you thinking?"
He said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
So I said. "Then what should I have done now?"
My mother said, "I really want you to tell me everything: Have you ever voted Republican?"
Yes, actually, I was just a French horn player, not interested in politics.
But then my parents found out what had happened, and there was some confusion.
I have become an ardent supporter of capitalism. Let me tell you why.
It stems from poverty, which has been my lifelong concern.
Growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw poverty.
We were a little below the middle class, but we weren't poor.
I couldn't even get near it.
The first time I saw poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was six or seven years old.
I was just a normal kid.
I saw a picture of a child my age in East Africa in National Geographic magazine. His face was full of flies and his abdomen was bulging.
I knew he wasn't going to live.
Some of you may remember that picture. Even if it's not that one picture.
It showed the West the endless poverty of the world.
That picture haunted me until I was old enough to go to school. I dropped out of school, went back to school, and started a family.
And what would have happened to the child,
I wondered what would have happened to those people around the world.
So even though I didn't go to college, I started studying. I was looking for an answer: What will happen to the poorest people in the world?
Could it have gotten worse? Would it have been better?
When I found the answers, they changed my life. I'll share it with you.
Look-- most Americans believe that poverty is worse than it was in their childhood.
Americans asked, "Has global poverty become evil?" Seventy percent of people say hunger is worse than it was in the early 1970s.
But the fact is that
It changed my mind.
From 1970 to the present, the share of hunger in the world living on less than $1 a day has decreased by 80 percent, adjusted for inflation.
From the time I was a child until now, world poverty has decreased by 80%.
I didn't even know.
That's really a miracle.
It's something we should be celebrating.
It is the greatest record of breaking poverty in human history. And that's what happened in the times we're living in.
When I found out, I was curious. How to? How was that possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If we knew why, we could lift the other 2 million poor people out of poverty. That's what we're talking about: at least 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty since I was a child.
I want the other 2 billion people to do the same.
I was trying to find an answer.
Other than political answers that I'm not interested in.
Still, I'm not interested in politics.
I was trying to find answers in all aspects of the economy.
The answer is this.
Let's see why.
Here are five reasons why 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
First: Globalization.
Second: free trade.
Third: Poverty Rights
Fourth: Provisions of the law
Fifth: Entrepreneurship.
The large-scale free-running system that made it possible spread around the world in the 1970s.
It doesn't sound naïve.
Free work isn't perfect, but it's not all we need to make the world a better place.
But it's a good thing.
It's not political.
Here's what I learned. This is a revelation.
Capitalism isn't just about accumulation.
It's about the best of it, about aspiration. That's what a lot of people on this stage have been talking about. Ambition comes from dreams and is embedded in free business.
We need to share it with more people. Similar to the first
Let me tell you the second story. I think it's going to make both the family and the world better.
My favorite quote sums up what I'm talking about. Saving people from poverty. "The free market has created the greatest wealth in history."
They lifted a billion people out of poverty.
Who said this?
Sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronal Reagan.
No.
That's what President Obama said.
How will I remember?
He told me.
It's crazy.
I said, "Hallelujah."
But other than that, he said, "It's an opportunity."
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, there was an event at Georgetown University that we participated in.
And I think that's the biggest problem facing America today.
I thought it was the answer. What could it be? With this in mind. Liberals and conservatives, the people who need us most.
I'm not trying to tell you that we're in crisis. The U.S. and other countries around the world are suffering from political polarization.
We're reaching a critical point.
That's not good. It's not right.
There was an article last year. It was published in the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
And this is an article about political imbalances, published in 2014.
What is this? What is it about this phenomenon that psychologists say is based on love, while the other side believes it is based on hate?
The answer is a common conflict.
It's something that can be seen in Palestine and Israel,
The author of this article found that most Republicans and Democrats in the United States today suffer from political imbalances.
People who are active in politics today believe that their motive is philanthropy and the opposition is hate.
Think about it.
If a lot of people walk around and say, "You know, my ideas are motivated by compassion, I want to help others, but other people are demons and they disturb me."
You can't develop a group with such an imbalance.
It's impossible.
How do I fix this?
Let's be honest: there is a difference.
You can reduce the difference: so purely.
It takes a lot of research.
This is TED stage veteran Jonathan Hyde.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He explores people's ideas, values, and morals to see differences. As he has shown, I think it's important for progressives and Democrats to be different.
For example, Jonathan Haidt said that the Progressive Party cares more about poverty than economic freedom.
And Conservatives are more than 28 per cent more concerned about economic freedom than poverty.
Irreconcilable differences, right?
We'll never be able to reconcile. Wrong.
That diversity is what makes it so strong.
Remember what broke poverty.
The idea of economic freedom and the obsession with poverty spread around the world.
In other words, we need each other. If we want to lift the next 2 billion people out of poverty,
There is no other way.
Blemish.
What should I do?
It's tricky, isn't it?
Innovative thinking is needed.
There's a lot of these things.
Social entrepreneurs. Yes, indeed. It's phenomenal.
We need foreign investment. Sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral.
Do you know what's the most important thing?
You need to think flexibly.
We need to be less predictable.
Isn't?
Don't you think our notions have become predictable at some point?
It's a cliché.
Don't you feel like you're always listening to people who empathize with you?
Why would that be dangerous?
We talk about the economy in this country, and conservatively we talk about taxes and regulation and government.
And on the progressive side, we talk about the income imbalance in the economy.
Is that right? This is the main thing. It's important to me and it's important to you.
But if you think of someone who is starving, that's just a hindrance.
We have to find the best way forward. If we want to eradicate poverty in the best way, we need the Conservatives need progressives, we need the Progressives' obsession with poverty, the Progressives need the Conservatives, we need the free markets.
That's the diversity that will make this country stronger in the future. If we make it happen.
What should I do? How can we do it together?
I have a course of action for you and me.
First. First Move: Remember, it's not enough to put up with those who disagree.
But that's not all.
We also need to know that we need people who don't agree with us. Because they're the ones who need our solutions.
What will you do next? How do you do that?
Where do I start? It's right here.
All of us here are blessed.
We have someone who listens to us.
We have been blessed with prosperity and blessed with leadership.
When people hear us talk about unpredictable ideas, they're probably going to listen.
That's where progress begins.
That's the first one.
Second: I ask you and myself, can you be such a vague and inexplicable person who will break down the boundaries of difference?
If you're a conservative, be a hero to the poor, a conservative who always talks about poverty and moral obligations.
And if you're a progressive, stay that liberal who debates how to solve problems with the advantages of the free market.
If that happens, we have two benefits.
First: We're going to solve the problem of the next 2 billion people. The solutions we saw in the past should also be visible in the future.
Second, we can turn the ideological conflict that this country is going through into a competition of ideas through mutual respect.
And maybe you'll even notice that the difference isn't that big.
I appreciate it.
When I was in college, I majored in political science. So there were a lot of assignments to write.
The average student would spread out their work this way when they were doing an assignment.
You know that. Start a little slow at first, but if you do as much as you can in the first week, you will do more later and everything will end up organized.
That's what I want to do.
That's how you plan it.
You've got it all set. But in fact, this is what happens when the assignment comes out.
This has happened with every assignment.
I also had a 90-page graduation thesis coming up. It was a thesis that required a year of investment.
I knew I couldn't do these assignments the way I usually do.
It's too important for that.
So I made a plan and I thought I should do this.
That's how you spend a year.
Start with a little bit of speed, then pick up some speed in the middle and get a little more energy at the end. It's like a small staircase.
How hard would it be to climb some stairs?
It's not a big deal, is it?
Then something really funny happened.
The first few months are
Time just went by and I didn't do much.
So we made some awesome plan revisions.
But then the middle month just passed, and there was nothing to write. So that's how it happened.
Two months became a month, then another two weeks.
Then one day I woke up and found that I hadn't written a single word even though I had only three days left due my deadline. So I did what I could. I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours. Not for a day, but for two full nights. If you're a human, you can't stay up all night for two nights. Then I jumped across campus and dived in slow motion to make it to the deadline.
I thought that was it.
A week later, I got a call from school.
"Are you Tim Urban?"
I said, "Yes."
"I have something to talk about my dissertation," he said.
I said, "Do it."
That's what schools do. "It's the best paper I've ever seen."
That didn't happen.
It was a very, very poor paper.
I just wanted to enjoy the brief moments when you think about this. "This guy is amazing!"
No, no, it sucked.
Anyway, at the moment I'm a blog writer.
I run a blog called "Wait, But Why".
A few years ago, I tried to write about procrastination.
My actions have always baffled those around me who don't procrastinate. I wanted to explain to them. What's going on in the minds of people who procrastinate and why we procrastinate.
I had a hypothesis. The brains of people who procrastinate are different from other people's.
To validate this, I found an MRI lab and had both sides of my brain scanned, as well as the brains of validated non-procrastinators and compared the two.
I've brought it to you today to show you.
Look closely to see the difference.
Unless you're a trained brain expert, you won't be able to see the difference, but take a look.
This is the brain of a person who does not procrastinate.
Now...
This is my brain.
There's a difference.
They both have "rational decision-makers," but procrastinators also have "instant gratification monkeys" in their brains.
What does this mean for someone who procrastinates?
It means that until this happens, everything is fine.
[It's better to do it now.] [Nope!] Rational decision-makers will make rational decisions in order to do productive work. But the monkey doesn't like it, so he gets behind the wheel and says, "Let's read all the Wikipedia pages of the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding scandals. That scandal just came to mind. And then go to the fridge and see if there's anything new than 10 minutes ago.
And then I go on YouTube and watch a video of Richard Feynman explaining the magnet, starting with a video of him explaining the magnet, and then finally watching a video of him interviewing Justin Bieber's mom.
It's all time-consuming, so I don't have time to do anything today.
Sorry!"
What's going on?
Instant gratification monkeys aren't the kind of kid you want to get behind the wheel.
He's living in the present moment.
They don't have any memories of the past or knowledge of the future, they only care about two things. Easy and fun.
In the animal kingdom, that's fine.
If you're a puppy and spend your whole life doing easy and fun things, you've succeeded!
To these monkeys, humans are just another species of animal.
All you have to do is sleep well, eat well, and reproduce well. In the Tribal Age, that would have been enough.
As you may know, this is no longer the era of tribes.
It's the age of advanced civilization, and monkeys don't know what it is.
That's why there's something else in our brains. It's called "rational decision-makers," and it gives us the ability to do things that animals can't.
You can dream of the future,
You can see the big picture, too
You can also make long-term plans.
Rational decision-makers want to take all of this into account.
They want to make you do something that makes sense right now. Sometimes it's easy and fun to do
Sometimes it's appropriate. Whether it's eating dinner, sleeping, or having a good leisure time. So there is some overlap.
Sometimes we disagree.
But sometimes, even if it's hard and you don't enjoy it, it makes a lot more sense to do it. For a greater good.
That's when the conflict arises.
For those who procrastinate, such conflicts always end in the same way. You'll spend a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun kingdom outside of the rational kingdom.
I call it the "Playground of Darkness."
The Playground of Darkness is a place where everyone who procrastinates knows well.
It's a place where leisure activities take place, and sometimes we shouldn't.
The fun in the Dark Playground isn't really fun. You don't deserve to play. The air there is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing, all of which are felt by procrastination.
The question is, if the monkeys are in power, how do the procrastinators go to the blue zone? It's a place where less enjoyable but important things happen.
Luckily, procrastination has a guardian angel. Always looking down on him and protecting him in his darkest moments, he is a panic monster.
Panic monsters are dormant most of the time, but they wake up suddenly when a deadline is just around the corner, when they're publicly humiliated, when a career disaster strikes, or when there's a terrible risk of repercussions.
The thing is, it's the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Until recently, they were very close to me in my life. TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to speak.
Of course, I said yes.
I've always dreamed of doing a TED talk.
But I was so excited that the rational decision-maker must have had a different idea.
He said, "You know what we accepted?
You certainly understand what will happen one day in the future, don't you?
You have to sit down and start right now."
The monkey says, "I totally agree, but for now, let's just open Google Earth and zoom in on the southern tip of India to get to know India better, and scroll up for two and a half hours until we reach the northern tip of India at 200 feet above sea level."
So that's what I did that day.
Six months became four, then two months, then one month, and then a TED official announced the speaker.
When I opened the website, I saw my face staring straight at me.
Who woke up?
That's when the panic monster starts to lose its mind. A few seconds later, the whole system went wild.
Then, the monkey, who is afraid of the panic monster, runs away to the tree!
Finally, a rational decision-maker was finally able to take the initiative and work on the talk.
Panic monsters explain the behavior of insane people who procrastinate. How people like me, who can't even write the first sentence of an assignment for two weeks, miraculously find a sense of work ethic and stay up all night writing eight pages.
All this situation is illustrated by three figures. This is the system of procrastination.
It's not in great shape, but it works in the end.
So I wrote about this on my blog a few years ago.
When I wrote it, the response was amazing.
There are literally thousands of emails from different people doing different things around the world.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a huge number of PhD students.
They all said the same thing. "I have the same problem."
But what surprised me was the contrast between the lighthearted tone of the blog posts and the very serious tone of the emails.
These people were very frustrated and complained about how their lives had become because of procrastination. What the monkey did to him.
I thought about this as I looked at it. The system of procrastinators works, so why is this?
Why are all these people in such a dark place?
As it turned out, there were two kinds of procrastination.
All of the examples I mentioned today had deadlines. When there is a deadline
The consequences of procrastination are limited to a short period of time. Panic monsters are involved.
But the second kind of procrastination occurs when there is no deadline.
If you want to be self-employed, such as in the arts or in business, there is no deadline for this. Nothing happens until you step up and do your job. There are many important things that don't have any deadlines other than jobs.
Seeing family, exercising, taking care of your health, maintaining relationships, and ending relationships that aren't going well. If the only mechanism that can get a procrastinator to do these difficult things is a panic monster, that's a problem. Because all of these things don't have deadlines, so there aren't panic monsters. There is no chance to wake up.
So the consequences of procrastination are not limited, they just last forever.
This is the long-term procrastination, which is ridiculous, short-term, and much less visible and undiscussed than the kind that has a deadline. They usually suffer quietly and alone.
This can be a source of considerable long-term unhappiness and regret. I think that's why people emailed me.
That's why they're in a very bad situation. It's not because they're cramming assignments.
Long-term procrastination is like putting yourself in
Sometimes it makes you feel like a spectator of your own life. The frustration is not because you can't achieve your dreams, but because
I couldn't even set off on my dreams. So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany, and I don't think there's anyone who doesn't procrastinate.
That is right. You are all procrastinators.
Well, maybe you're not that messed up like we are. You may have a healthy relationship with a deadline, but remember, the monkey's tricks come when there is no deadline.
One last thing I want to show you.
I call it the life calendar.
In 90 years of life, there is a box every week.
There aren't a lot of boxes. Especially since we've already used a lot of boxes.
I think it is necessary to look carefully at this calendar for a long time.
We need to think about what we are putting off. Everyone puts something off in life.
You have to be aware of the instant gratification monkey at all times.
That's what we all need to do.
We don't have a lot of boxes left on our calendar, so maybe we should start today.
Well, even if it's not today...
what
Someday, soon.
I appreciate it.
On that day, we were in the last days of our lives as souls and bodies gathered in a Texas church.
It's similar to this room here, but with creaky wooden chairs draped over an old red cloth, with the organ to my left and the choir behind me. A baptismal bath was installed on the wall behind the choir.
That said, it was similar to this place.
As here, there was tension, there was hope for salvation, hands were clenched, and the people sitting in the back were not paying attention.
It was December 31, 1999, the night of Jesus' Second Coming, and I knew it was the end of the world.
I turned 12 that year, and I was at an age where I felt responsible.
And as soon as I was old enough to take responsibility for what I had done, I thought it would be better to stop complaining about the injustice of Jesus' return and get my house in order very quickly.
So I went to church as often as I could.
I listened to the silence as hard as people listened to the voice, to make sure that God didn't take me first. I decided to go home early.
Even though Jesus had returned, I prepared an alternative by reading "Those Who Are Left Behind," which was popular at the time.
The book says that if I don't indulge in the ecstasy of the Second Coming at midnight, I have a chance.
To do this, I had to avoid receiving the mark of the beast and fight the devil, the plague, and the antichrist.
It must have been difficult. But I believed I could do it.
But the time for planning is over.
The clock read 11:50.
There were 10 minutes left until the Second Coming, and the pastor called us out of our chairs and asked us to come out of the chairs to the Foundation. I wanted to be praying when midnight came.
So all the believers gathered and took their seats.
The choir remained in the choir seat, and the clergy and their wives, as I like to call them, the Baptist bourgeoisie sat at the front of the foundation.
In the United States, there are VIP seats even on the day of the Second Coming.
And right behind the Baptist bourgeoisie were the elders. The scorching sun of the cotton plantations of East Texas made them bend over in their youth, and their wrinkle-free, virtuous brown skin burned like the mud of East Texas, and their dreams and hopes of what life would be like outside of East Texas were sometimes more bent and broken than their bent backs.
These seniors were the protagonists of the day for me.
They have been waiting their whole lives for this moment. Just as our ancestors in the Middle Ages wished for the end of the world. And like my grandmother would wait for the Oprah Winfrey Show to do every day at 4 p.m. on Channel 8.
When she headed to the Foundation, I was close behind her. I firmly believed that my grandmother would go to heaven, and if I held her hand while praying,
I thought I could go with it. So I took my hand and closed my eyes. To listen and wait.
Prayers grew louder, and the cry of answer to prayer
It was getting louder and louder.
The organ was adding a funeral tune to it.
Sweat added to the heat.
I clenched my hands and tried not to be left alone.
I closed my eyes tighter and tried not to watch people fall away.
And a voice rang out above us as we prayed. "Amen"
It's over.
I looked at the clock
It was already past midnight.
I looked at the seniors. Their savior did not come. They didn't dare to show their disappointment, but they had trusted so much and for so long that they were now beginning to doubt.
I was angry at their situation.
They have been deceived, blindfolded, and bullied. And I've been right there with them.
I prayed for them and tried not to give in to temptation.
I dipped my head in that runny baptismal bath, not once, but twice.
I believed fervently.
What am I going to do?
When I got home and turned on the TV, I saw Peter Jennings proclamating the new millennium. Traveling around the world.
My sudden thought was that it was strange for Jesus to go around the world and return at the same time.
This made me even more ridiculous and really heartbreaking.
But that day, I didn't lose faith there.
I just began to believe in something new. It's possible not to believe.
Maybe my answer is wrong, or maybe the problem itself is wrong.
And a once-great mountain of confidence flowed down to its source. It was a fountain of doubt. The spring that promised a river.
I vividly remember that night in church when my Savior did not show up for me all my life. The day I learned that what I believed most wasn't true, if not false.
I'm sure most of you greeted Y2K in a different way, but I'm sure the reason you're here to see my talk is because some of you have experienced the same thing as I do. From the beginning of the new millennium, after my mother left, after my father drifted away, and since the Savior did not appear.
I clasped my hands together and desperately sought a place to lean on.
I entered Yale at the age of 18. With the faith I grew up in Oak Cliff, Texas. It was an opportunity for me to put behind the many trials I had gone through and the breakdown of my body and mind.
But when I came home from winter break, I found my face on the floor, my hands tied behind my back, and a robber's gun pointed at my head. It was at this time that I realized that even if I studied a lot, I would not be saved.
I also had faith in Lehman Brothers, where I interned in 2008.
Filled with hope, I called my family and told them that we would never be poor anymore.
But after witnessing this temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I realized that even the best jobs could not save me.
I grew in faith while working as a young employee in Washington, D.C. I came to believe in Illinois, "It's been very hard to get here. But this election is going to change America."
But when the National Assembly failed to function and the whole country collapsed, I realized that hope and change felt like a cruel joke, and that the return of the political savior would not save me.
I knelt before the altar of the American Dream and prayed to the God of our time. To the god of success, money, and power.
But I kept waking up in the middle of the night to see that all these gods were dead.
In my desperation, I began to search once more. Not because I was brave, but because I knew I was at a crossroads between believing or dying.
So I went on a pilgrimage to another holy place. At Harvard Business School. This time, I knew I couldn't just accept a salvation that I claimed to be true.
But I knew I had more to do.
It all started with a question that three friends and I had late on a miserable early Cambridge winter night in a dark corner of a crowded party. There was something that young people seeking the truth had been asking for a long time. "Why don't we go on a trip in the car?"
We didn't know where or how we were going to go, but we had to go.
Because all our lives we've longed for a life like Jack Kerouac's novels, where you can "sneak out of the night and disappear somewhere," and we've tried to find out how people live all over the country.
So others said it was too risky and the evidence was weak, but we left anyway.
In the summer of 2013, I traveled 8,000 miles across the United States. I passed through the paddocks of Montana, through the moors of Detroit, across the swamps of New Orleans, and worked with the people there. They were people who lived up to the basic line of life through small businesses.
And as a steeped in Western capitalism, I was shocked by this innovation.
This idea grew into a non-profit foundation, MBAs Across America. It's the movement that got me here today.
This movement has spread because our generation has a deep longing for purpose and meaning.
This movement has spread because so many entrepreneurs are creating jobs and changing lives across the United States and need a little help.
But to be honest, this movement has spread because I've been fighting for it.
I was willing to go anywhere to preach this gospel. So that more people believe that we can sew this torn country together as a social enterprise
But this journey of preaching the gospel led me to a different gospel. That's the gospel I want to share with you today.
About a year ago, there was an alumni event at the Natural History Museum in New York City at the Harvard Business School alumni event.
There was a life-size model of a whale. I was sitting down there with some of the biggest names of our time, and they were celebrating their accomplishments with their colleagues.
There was a lot of pride. That's because the net worth and wealth of operations under management exceeded $500 billion.
It was great to see what we had accomplished together.
Two days later, however, something else happened. I went to Harlem to preach the gospel. I sat there on a city farm that had once been vacant and listened to a man named Tony talk to me about the children who came there every day.
All of these children were living in extreme poverty.
Many children carried everything they had in their bags. Not to lose it in a homeless shelter.
Some of them join Tony's 'Harlem Grown' for their only meal of the day.
Tony said he started 'Harlem Grown' by robbing his pension The pension I earned after driving a taxi for 20 years.
He said he took his pension because the program was successful but needed sponsorship.
He said he was willing to accept any help.
And I helped.
But as I parted ways with Tony, I felt my eyes sting and tears welled up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation. One day you're in one room with hundreds of people with $500 billion, and two days you're in another room just 50 blocks away watching someone give up their pension to feed their child.
It was not because of the stark inequality that I shed tears. I didn't shed tears at the thought of the hungry children on the streets. It's not anger at the top 1% or sympathy for the other 99%.
The reason I was heartbroken was because I realized that I was just a dialysis machine in this country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story was taking the place of people who were encouraged to lace up their boots when they didn't even have them. I felt that my organization was taking the place of structural and systemic help that didn't reach Harlem, Appalachia, or New Orleans, and that my voice was replacing the voices of the uneducated, the unwashed, the unlivable.
And I started to feel ashamed of it. It was the same shame I felt when I sat in front of the TV and cried out again and again and again about the new millennium.
I was deceived, blindfolded, and confused.
But this time, I was the false savior.
You see, I've walked a long way from that altar to here on that night when I thought the world was going to end. In a world where people used to say that suffering is a necessary act of God and that what the Bible says is the absolute truth.
Yes, I've come a long way and I'm back where I started.
Because we cannot simply say that we are living in a time of unbelief. Today we have as much faith as countless before us.
Some of us may believe the prophecies of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
Some of us may believe The New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review as if they were the Bible.
We may believe most deeply when we gather here at TED Church for worship. But we desperately want to believe, and we must believe.
We're promising to solve all our problems, like charismatic leaders.
We see suffering as a necessary evil of capitalism, which we believe in, and accept technological advances as irrefutable truths.
And we realize little about the human cost of not asking these little questions. Because we are afraid of shaking our entire foundation.
But if you are saddened by the absurdities we have come to accept, it is time to question.
I'm not talking about the gospel of collapse or reform or new principles of measuring corporate performance.
In fact, I am not here today to preach the gospel of faith to you.
I have come to preach the gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt is not telling you not to believe. Instead, I'm telling you to believe in something new. It's possible not to believe.
The answer we have may be wrong, and the people who believe in it may be wrong.
I do. The gospel of doubt is that all of us here could be wrong.
Because this gospel asks, "Why?" This is because it raises the question.
With all our hearts, we folded our hands together: Why do people still have to suffer like this?
This suspicion led me to close my organization, MBAs Across America.
We've let go of our employees, we've closed our doors, and we're going to share our business model for free. So that anyone who has the ability to do this can do it without our permission.
These doubts have caused some to give up their role as a savior. Because our lives are too short and unlikely to wait for the Second Coming of the Savior. In fact, there are no miracles in this world.
And this doubt will give me strength and hope. When we are overwhelmed with anxiety, when the path before us seems to lead us to our end, when our healers are no longer able to heal our wounds, our humble doubts, not our blind faith, become a small light in the darkness that has spread out in our lives and in this world, and we lift up our voices to whisper
They will either shout it out or simply say: Very simply, "There must be another way." I said.
I appreciate it.
Food Shortage
It appears in the news every day.
What could be the problem?
While there are places in the world where food is scarce, there are too many of it.
Somewhere, GMOs are saving the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Excess agricultural wastewater pollutes the oceans. soil nutrients are reduced,
The vicious cycle continues.
And when I look at this phenomenon, it's very disheartening.
How can we feel this situation with our own skin?
How could these apples be food short?
You've probably eaten an apple recently.
How long do you think it has been since you picked this apple?
Two weeks?
2 months?
11 months. The average age of apples sold in supermarkets in the United States.
I don't think the situation is much different in any part of the world. Then they add chemicals. There are real cases of loss of life. This is because the chemicals used in the process of slowing down the deterioration of apples are also harmful to the human body. How is it that no one knows this?
Why didn't I know?
By the time we eat these apples, we've lost about 90% of our nutrients, including antioxidant enzymes.
These apples are nothing more than lumps of sugar.
How can there be such an information deficit? How can we do better?
What we lack is a platform.
Platforms and computers connected me to the internet when I was a child.
I've done a lot of weird things on this platform. It allowed me to meet people and express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a platform, we could ask questions autonomously. Just in case?
I asked this question: What if the climate were equal?
This is a map showing the world's climate.
The most productive areas are green, and the opposite is red.
The climate changes. California farmers are now Mexican farmers.
China wants to buy land in Brazil to grow high-quality food. We are highly dependent on the climate.
What if every country could have an optimal climate?
How will you change our lives?
How will it affect the quality of life and the quality of food?
Previous generations of food shortages were cheaper and needed more food.
Welcome to International Farms.
We built a large analogue farm.
The lines shown above are the transport routes for cars, planes, trains, etc.
It is a miracle that only a small percentage of society participates in agriculture and feeds 7 billion people.
But what if....
What if you build a digital international farm?
What if this apple could be digitized and transported into the air to be reconstructed on the other side of the world?
Just in case?
The quotes I'm going to share with you inspire what I do.
First: ["Japanese agriculture has no water, no land, no young blood, no future."] This is an uncomfortable truth I was confronted with when I arrived at Minamisanriku at the southern tip of Fukushima after the catastrophe.
Young people headed to Sendai and Tokyo, where the land was polluted and the food was 70% foreign-made.
However, this phenomenon is not limited to Japan.
Only 2% of the U.S. is involved in agriculture.
How can 2% of the population do something about it?
Other areas are no better. 50% of Africa's population is under the age of 18.
80% don't want to be farmers.
Farming is tough.
Life is miserable for small farmers.
Young people make their way to the city.
In India, members of farms are not guaranteed even the minimum infrastructure. In the last decade, the suicide rate among farmers has never been higher.
It's an uncomfortable truth to talk about.
Where are people headed?
It's a city.
There are no young people in the homestead.
How do we make this platform move young people?
It's a new tractor.
It's my harvest season.
A few years ago, I stopped by Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot to start making things.
I've made silly things, made plants dance, and killed them all by connecting them to my computer. Killed several times.
Then I had the most intimate relationship of my life with plants. Because I was learning their language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
"There's an old electronics lab here that no one wants
Take advantage of it."
Together with my team, we built a farm in it. In a place that has nothing to do with biology. Within this 18.3 square meters
It's not that much, but it produced enough to feed 300 people one meal each month. There's a lot of interesting technology in there.
The most exciting part?
Beautiful, pure white roots, dark green leaves, and a one-month harvest cycle
Is this the new cafeteria?
Maybe it's a new retail experience?
Maybe it's a new supermarket?
One thing can be affirmed. The Media Lab folks were the first to uproot something.
I just ate the salad in the bag, so it's not too strange.
If you're rooting with image-based processing experts and data scientists and roboticists, you're going to think about this with each other. "Well, maybe I can contribute to this field.
Do you know. In the meantime, we took some of the plants back to the lab. Because what you have grown is precious, and you can't throw it away.
I have a delicate sense of taste. Because I want my plants to be delicious
This is because they eat lettuce before others every day. Now, you can get the pH of your lettuce within the 0.1 range just by tasting it.
"It's a pH of 6.1. I can't eat today."
This lettuce was very sweet.
This is because this plant has been stressed and has undergone a chemical reaction to protect itself. "I'm not going to die!"
The plant's resistance to life is sweet to me.
Instead of relying on the latest technology, we went back to plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to do the same.
I want to see your limitless imagination. That's why we came up with the idea of a lab that could be shipped anywhere, and we put it into practice.
The front of this media lab is my lab. As many as 30 sensors are used per plant.
If you know the genome or the genetics, isn't that the phenom?
One phenomenon
If you're saying that "Mexican strawberries are good," then it's more accurate to say that strawberries grown in that climate are better.
If you can code the climate, this amount of CO2 and O2 is the right prescription. You're coding the nutrition, climate, size and shape, and color and texture of the plant you want to grow.
To do this, we need data to be able to analyze what's going on, and that's why we have a lot of sensors attached.
Take a look at your plants. "Why are you dying? Why can't you talk!?"
You're going to be sad about this. The farmer will have the most beautiful eyes of the Prophet.
When they enter their 60s and 70s, they can see a withering plant and know if it's nitrogen deficiency or calcium deficiency.
You'll know if you need more humidity.
That wisdom has not been passed on to future generations.
This is the new eye for the cloud environment.
We find trends in the data we have gathered over time and look for associations with individual plants.
These figures are the IP addresses of all the broccoli served on the day of the buffet.
It's time for broccoli to also have an IP address.
If you're ready to be more surprised, you can click on it to see the profile of that plant.
It shows the growth of the plant. But it's not just about showing when it's ripe.
Whether or not I have achieved the nutritional conditions I want
When you get the flavor you want
Are you getting too much water?
Are you getting too much sunlight?
It alerts you to all of this. The plant is talking to me.
We have our own language.
Maybe you're the first user of the plant Facebook? That plant will start making friends.
I mean it. That plant will make friends with a plant that needs less nitrogen and potassium but requires more phosphorus.
You'll learn about complex connections that you can only speculate about now. It depends on what we do.
This is what my lab looks like now.
Now you have a little bit of a system. I know a little bit about controlled environments because of my background in designing healthcare data centers.
So we're experimenting in this environment.
This spraying process was also developed by NASA to reduce the amount of water sent to the Mir space station.
This process ensures that you get what your plants want at the right time. Water, Mineral Resources and Oxygen
Roots are not so picky. If you satisfy that, you will get a beautiful response.
It's like having two hearts.
That's why it grows four or five times faster.
It's the perfect environment.
We have a long history of developing seeds that overcome adverse environments. The effort will continue. But we also have a new weapon: a flawless environment. It's a plant we've tried.
It has not been commercially grown for 150 years.
Do you know of a seed bank that stores all kinds of seeds?
Seed Bank
It's an awesome place.
There are a variety of germ plasm preserved there, and there are many that have never been eaten before.
I'm probably the only person in the room who has ever eaten a tomato like that.
The problem is that these tomatoes are for sauces, but we can't cook them. The next best thing was to eat it raw, and it was just so.
We've also grown a lot of different things through protein modifications.
I also raised people. Of course, it really didn't.
What we realized during our experiments was that the device was too big and too expensive.
It cost about $100,000 each to install in various locations around the world.
Not many people can afford to spend $100,000 at any time. That's why we wanted to make it smaller.
In fact, this project belongs to Camille, an undergraduate student of mine who is majoring in mechanical engineering. So Camille and my team spent the summer thinking about how we could make cheaper, better performing products easier.
And we have installed this machine in grades 7~11 classes in various schools.
To feel humility, teach your children.
At one point, I asked the students in question. "Set the humidity to 65%."
A seventh-grader asked. "What is humidity?"
"Humidity is water in the air."
"There's no water in the air! Uncle."
So I advised. "yes, don't trust me."
Why do you trust me?
Set the humidity to 100.
What happened when the child changed the settings?
The gas condenses, causing water vapor to rise, and eventually water droplets.
Then the child says: "Oh! Humidity is the rain."
"Why didn't you tell me that?"
The interface we've created is similar to an online game.
Users can access the 3D environment from anywhere in the world. You can also do it on your smartphone and tablet.
The user adjusts the physical environment and sensors of this mechanical garden.
You can choose from different children's cultivation methods around the world.
And activate the cultivation method and plant the seeds.
You can also make changes during the growth of the seed.
"Why do we need carbon dioxide, isn't it bad for you to kill people?"
They could kill plants by dramatically increasing carbon dioxide levels.
You can also lower the levels to make the plant grow better.
Once you've grown your plants, you'll have a new digital cultivation method.

As if these two things seem completely different, in my field
Everything is different.
This field is at a stage where we are complacent, "Isn't that enough?" A small scuffle ensues, and they show off their products to each other. "Mine includes very expensive intellectual property.
Buy mine instead of that."
But the reality is that we're just getting started.
It is also a time when society is changing rapidly. In the past, it was cheap, plentiful food,
Now we need quality, eco-friendly food. It wouldn't be strange if it became the No. 1 most mysterious food in the world

Blaming each other is not the future of food.
We already know what's wrong.
The future of food supply is about connecting the next generation of farmers to platforms to empower them and ask each other questions. "What if?"
I appreciate it.
Sometimes I'm really ashamed to be European.
In the past year, millions of people in need of our help have arrived in Europe. And our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Cuddy, but more than 200 children continued to drown in the Mediterranean Sea after that.
We have an international treaty, which recognizes refugees as a shared responsibility. Nevertheless, we have accepted that little Lebanon hosts more Syrians, than all European countries.
We mourn the existence of human smugglers. But we are making it so that it is the only way to get asylum in Europe.
We are experiencing a labor shortage. But we are blocking from coming to Europe those who are necessary for the economy and the population.
We are standing up for the value of freedom against Islamic fundamentalism. But we have a coercive policy. They detain asylum-seeking children, separate children from their families, and confiscate refugees' property.
What are we doing?
How did things get to this point? Why are we confronting humanitarian crises in such an inhumane way?
I don't think it's because people aren't interested. No, at least, I don't want to believe that.
I think it's because our politicians don't have a vision. They don't have a vision of how to adapt the international refugee system, which was created more than 50 years ago, to a changing and globalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very fundamental questions, questions that we all need to answer.
First, why isn't the current system working?
Second, what do we need to do to fix this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of World War II. By these people.
The basic goal of this is guarantees, to ensure that when a state fails, or worse, turns its back on its own people, people are guaranteed a place to go and live in security and dignity until they can go home.
It was created for a situation like Syria today.
Through international agreements signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Agreement on the Status of Refugees and the international agency, UNHCR, agreed to mutually accept people fleeing physical conflict and abuse on their territory.
Today, however, that system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In fact, our immigration policies are blocking the path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to be accommodated or to return to their countries.
But in reality, they are trapped in a situation of uncertainty with no end in sight.
In theory, refugees are a global shared responsibility.
In fact, if you look at the demographics, countries close to the conflict zone overwhelmingly host the vast majority of the world's refugees.
This system is not broken because the rules are wrong.
It's because we haven't been able to adapt appropriately to a changing world. And this is exactly what we need to reconsider.
So I'm going to give you a quick rundown of how the current system works.
How does the refugee system work in practice?
I'm not talking from an institutional point of view from above, but from the perspective of a refugee.
Consider one Syrian woman.
I'm going to call her Amira.
To me, Amirah represents the many people I met in that area.
Amira is a woman with a child, as is about 25% of the world's refugees. And she can't go home. It's from this city. Once a beautiful and historic city as you see on screen, Homs is now covered in rubble.
So Amira can't go back.
However, Amira cannot hope of resettlement in a third country. That's because it's a lottery that only allows less than 1% of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family are faced with an almost impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is to take the family to the camp.
Help may be found in the camp, but there is little hope for Amira and her family.
The camp is located in a deserted, almost arid area.
In the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear shells from across the Syrian border at night.
Economic activity is also limited,
The quality of education is also low.
And about 80% of refugees living in camps worldwide have to stay there for at least five years.
It's a miserable life, and it's probably why only 9% of Syrians choose the camps.
Instead, Amira may head to urban areas in neighboring countries such as Aman and Beirut.
This is the method that 75% of Syrian refugees have already chosen.
But there are enormous challenges there, too.
Usually, refugees do not have the right to work in such urban areas.
There is no special way to get help.
As a result, Amira and her family are left with little money or poverty.
So there's a third alternative, which a lot of Syrians have been taking lately.
Amira is willing to entrust her life to a very dangerous and arduous journey to another country for the sake of her family. This is the phenomenon that we see in Europe today.
The world is forced to make three near-impossible choices for refugees. Prison Camp Life, Urban Poverty, and Dangerous Travel
For refugees, that choice is today's global refugee relief.
However, I think this is the wrong choice.
I think we need to rethink this choice.
The reason we limit our options is because we think it's the only option for refugees, but that's not the case.
Politicians characterize it as a zero-sum issue. In other words, if you give benefits to refugees, you're going to have to pay for them.
We seem to view refugees as an inevitable expense or a burden on society.
But it is not. They can contribute, too.
So what I would argue is that there is a way to expand the options for refugees and still benefit everyone. For the host country and the organization, for our society and for the refugees.
And what I would like to propose are four ways to change the paradigm of dealing with refugees.
These four methods have one thing in common. It's all about taking advantage of globalization, liquidity, market opportunities, and shifting the way we think about the refugee issue.
The first thing I want you to think about is the delivery environment. And this starts from the basic recognition that refugees are people just like us. It's just the perception that you're in a special environment.
My colleague in Oxford and I worked on a research project in Uganda that looked at the economic life of refugees.
We chose Uganda not because we represent the host country.
Uganda is an exception.
Unlike most host countries in the world, what Uganda has done is provide economic opportunities for refugees.
It provided the right to work, it provided freedom of movement.
And the consequences were devastating for both refugees and society.
In the capital, Kampala, we saw that 21% of the refugees were in businesses employing others, and 40% of the employees were Ugandans.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs. To the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we found an exceptional case: vibrant, thriving entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, we saw the case of a Congolese refugee who runs a digital music business in a settlement called Nakhivale.
In addition, a Rwandan refugee ran a business that used recycled TVs and game consoles to allow children to play computer games.
In the face of extreme constraints, the refugees were innovating. This gentleman in front of you is a Congolese man called Demokei,
Even though he came to his residence almost empty-handed, he wanted to be a filmmaker.
So I started a local radio station with friends and colleagues, borrowed a video camera, and now I'm making movies.
He made two documentaries for our team, and he built a successful business from almost nothing.
This is an example that can change our response to refugees.
Refugees should not be seen as merely dependent on humanitarian aid, but should be given the opportunity to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothes, blankets, shelter, and food are all very important elements in an emergency. But we need to look beyond that.
You have to give them a chance. Connections, electricity, education, the right to work, capital and finance.
Everything we take for granted in the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second thing I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world are taking the same steps as Uganda.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees.
However, there are still practical alternatives that we can take.
Last April, my colleague and I visited Jordan. I came up with the idea while I was there, along with development economist Paul Koriller. Together with the international community and government. In support of Jordan's national development strategy to provide jobs to Syrians,
The idea is about economic zones, which could potentially integrate refugee employment with employment in Jordan, the host country.
Just 15 minutes from the Za'atari refugee camp, the 83,000 refugees are home to an existing economic zone known as the King Hersen bin Taral Development Zone.
The government spent more than $100 million to build a network of electric utilities and a network of roads. However, two things were lacking. It was labor access and internal investment.
What if refugees had been able to work there, support their families and gain skills through vocational training rather than being confined in camps? That is, until I went back to Syria.
It will be beneficial for Jordan. This is because Jordan's development strategy calls for it to leap into a middle-class country through manufacturing.
Not only does this benefit refugees, but it can also contribute to the recovery of Syria after the conflict. It is through the recognition that we must embrace refugees as the best resource for the reconstruction of Syria.
We published this idea in the journal Foreign Affairs,
King Abdullah adopted our idea.
It was announced two weeks ago at the Syria Conference in London and will be piloted this summer.
The third idea I would like to suggest to you is to match the preferences of the state and the people of the country to achieve a happy outcome, as shown here in the picture of Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Syrian refugees.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or where they want to go. But I have to ask this and I would argue that this can benefit everyone.
The economics journal Alvin Ross developed the idea of a matching market. A person's preferred ranking is how they make a match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Titelboim studied whether the idea could be applied to refugees. We asked refugees to rank their preferred destinations, and we matched them to countries in terms of technology and language.
Of course, there will be some tolerance for diversity or vulnerability here, but it's still a way to increase the likelihood of matching.
The idea of matching is used in many places, such as matching students with university locations, matching kidney recipients with patients, and even in the algorithms of dating websites.
What if we applied this to refugees' critical choices?
Of course, it is also applicable at the national level. The great challenge we face: convincing communities to accept refugees.
And, for example, at that moment in our country, we often send engineers and farmers to rural and urban areas. It's ridiculous.
Therefore, market matching is both a way to ask for preferences and a potential way to meet the needs and demands of refugees as well as host countries.
The fourth ideal I would like to tell you about is the humanitarian visa.
Most of the tragedies and chaos we see in Europe are largely preventable.
This stems from the fundamental contradictions of European asylum policy. That is to say, in order to seek asylum in Europe, you have to voluntarily embark on the very dangerous journey that I mentioned earlier.
But why do you have to travel like this? In this day and age of low-cost airlines and modern consular power.
It's a really unnecessary trip, and more than 3,000 people have lost their lives on European borders and European territories in the last year.
If refugees could travel directly to Europe, if they could find asylum, we would have been able to avoid it, and we would have been able to do something through what we call humanitarian visas. People can get visas from embassies or consulates in neighboring countries, and then they can buy a boat or an airline ticket to go to Europe.
If you want to go from Turkey to the Greek islands through a smuggler, you will have to pay 1,000 euros.
It costs 200 euros to travel from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
Allowing refugees to do so would be a clear advantage.
It could save lives, it could limit the market for smugglers, and it could eliminate the chaos we see on the front lines of Europe, such as the Greek islands.
What prevents us from doing so is politics, not rational solutions.
And here is the applied idea.
Brazil has taken a pioneering approach, issuing humanitarian visas to 2,000 Syrians, allowing them to enter Brazil and granting them refugee status.
Thanks to this system, all Syrians were granted refugee status and were recognized as pure refugees.
There is also a historical precedent for this.
Between 1922 and 1942, Nansen passports were used for travel, and 450,000 Assyrian, Turkish, and Chechen were allowed to travel to Europe and were granted refugee status anywhere in Europe.
And the Nansen International Refugee Agency was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its effective strategy.
So the four ideas that I've talked about are ways we can increase Amira's options.
It's a way to give refugees more choices. It's a way to go beyond the three basic, almost impossible choices and as I said, to benefit everyone.
In conclusion, we really need a new perspective. A vision that can increase refugees' choices, a vision that doesn't have to be perceived as a burden.
If you look at refugees as a cost, everything becomes possible.
Of course, they are humanitarian responsibilities, but they are people with skills, talents, inspiration, and the ability to contribute. Unless, of course, we can help them do that.
In the new world, migration is not about leaving forever.
What we have witnessed in Europe will not last long.
People will continue to travel, they will find new settlements, and we need to find a reasonable and realistic way to do this. Not based on the old theory of humanitarian aid, not on philanthropy, but on creating opportunity, on globalization, on markets, on mobility.
I would call on all of you and your politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a child, I used to dream about the ocean.
The sea was a wild world full of color and life, and home to strange and fantastical creatures.
I photographed the big sharks that dominated the food chain and watched graceful sea turtles dance across the reefs.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I've spent most of my professional life searching for the fantastic places I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I experienced the world of water from a fairly young age
The first time I went to the deep sea, I was only 10 years old.
I still vividly remember flipping furiously to reach the old, hard cannon on the reef.
When I finally got the cannon in my hand, I looked up and realized that I was surrounded by colorful iridescent fish.
That day, I fell in love with the sea
[Thomas Pessack] Having lived on this planet for 40 years, I have had the privilege of working for National Geographic Monthly and the Save Our Sys Foundation, exploring some of the most beautiful seascapes.
I've photographed a lot of creatures, from very, very huge sharks to dainty sharks that fit in the palm of your hand.
In the cold waters in front of Canada's Great Bear rainforest, I smelled the fishy breath of the black bronze whales feeding in front of me.
I also saw the mating ceremony of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Strait.
Every person on this planet has an impact on the oceans, and everyone is affected by them.
And the pristine ocean that I dreamed of as a child is becoming more and more difficult to find.
They are under increasing pressure and threat.
I have witnessed and photographed the ripple effects that we humans have had on nature as the leading predators on the planet.
For quite some time, I thought I had to show a shocking picture to wake the viewer from apathy.
Although this approach has its merits, it's back to square one.
The best way to make a difference is to spread love.
Maybe I'm a kind of matchmaker and photographer, with a rare opportunity to reveal the animals and ecosystems that lie hidden beneath the surface of the ocean.
If you don't even know it exists, you can't love and defend anything.
Revealing the beauty of nature is the power of conservation photography.
I've visited hundreds of offshore locations, but only a few have left a deep impression on me.
The first time I was in such ecstasy was about 10 years ago on the rugged and wild coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, the giant sardines migrate north in a mass migration called the Sardine Run.
These fish have a good reason to flee.
They are being chased by hordes of hungry and nimble predators.
Porpoises hunt together. They separate some sardines from the main herd and turn them into bait masses.
Dolphins trap the fish and lure them to the surface of the ocean, where they feast on the fluttering and moving feast.
Behind you, a shark chases you.
Many people think that sharks and dolphins are crippled enemies, but in sardine running, the two coexist.
In fact, dolphins help sharks prey more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait mass is scattered even more, and the sharks often fill their bellies with what I call sardine doughnuts. Your mouth will fill with water.
I've had a few dangerous moments with sharks in the sardine run, but the sharks don't see me as prey.
But at this raucous banquet, I'm bumped and tailed like any other guest.
From the coast of Africa, we cross the vast Indian Ocean and head east to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral reef islands.
And during the stormy southwestern rainy season, manta rays from all over the archipelago migrate to a small area of the Baa Ring called Hanifaru.
Groups of carapaces, no larger than their pupils, are their main prey.
When the plankton density decreases, they feed alone. Like a puppy chasing its tail, they keep doing somersaults.
However, as plankton densities increase, manta rays form this long food chain. And it is obvious that the prey that escapes the first or second manta ray will be eaten by the next manta ray.
When plankton levels are at their peak in the bay, manta rays exhibit what we call vortex feeding and swim close.
And while swimming in dense formations, manta rays create their own whirlpools and suck plankton into their mouths.
Swimming surrounded by a pod of manta rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like the Manta Foundation, my photographs ultimately helped Hanifaru turn into a marine protected area.
Fishermen from neighboring islands who hunted manta rays to make traditional drums out of shells
Now these are the most ardent environmentalists. And the Maldivian economy earns more than $8 million annually from manta rays.
I always find that the map is mostly blank or that the map says "dragons live." I wanted to travel back in time to the time when it was written.
And so far, the closest I've ever had to it was on a remote coral reef in the western Indian Ocean.
Diving into the water, far from ocean lanes and fishing fleets, is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Vasas da India. It's a small coral reef island in the Strait of Mozambique.
Corals form a protective outer barrier, and the inner lagoon is a larval breeding ground for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I had a rough idea that the sharks would get bolder at night.
I've never seen so many sharks congregating on a single coral reef.
Capturing and sharing these moments reminds me why I chose this path.
Earlier this year, I went to Baja California for an assignment for National Geographic magazine.
And about halfway from the Pacific side, you'll find the San Ignacio Lagoon. It is an important birthing site for ghost whales.
For a hundred years, this coast has been the site of massacres. More than 20,000 ghost whales have died, leaving only a few hundred.
Today, descendants of surviving whales push their calves to the surface of the sea to play with us and even interact with us.
This species has made a truly remarkable comeback.
On the other side of the peninsula is the languid fishing village of Cabo Pulmo.
Decades of overfishing have brought the town to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded authorities to designate their shores as a marine reserve.
But what has happened since then has been nothing short of miraculous.
In 2005, after just 10 years of protection, scientists witnessed the recovery of some of the largest fish in history.
But don't take my word for it, come with me.
Let's swim together into the largest and densest school of fish I've ever encountered.
We can all be creators of hope.
And I want to use my photography to teach the lesson that there is still hope in our oceans.
In particular, I want to draw attention to the resilience of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that it will be very difficult to take pictures like this in the future, but I want to take pictures that show how we and the ocean coexist with mutual respect.
Hopefully, taking such pictures will become a daily routine.
To survive and thrive as a marine photographer, you have to be a great optimist.
I always work with the belief that the next great photo that will make a difference is nearby. After the next coral, it's in the lagoon you're going to encounter, or in the place you're going to encounter next.
When I came to Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1985, the government was placing social justice at the heart of its national health policy.
After a long war of independence, a new government was formed, and the new government immediately established a socialist policy. Health services and basic education were provided free of charge.
The number of rural health centers has exploded, with 80% of the population within two hours of a health center.
In 1980, shortly after independence, only 25% of children were vaccinated.
Ten years later, in 1990, that number had risen to 80 percent.
I took great pride in being a part of this change and revolution.
I felt a strong excitement and camaraderie with people.
Working with some of the best scientists, doctors, and activists in Zimbabwe, I felt like I was on the ground of African independence movements, and even in the experiment of global welfare movements. But there were challenges.
In 1985, the year I first arrived,
The first case of HIV infection has been reported in Zimbabwe.
I had seen a few AIDS patients during my medical training, but I couldn't expect equal medical resources in Africa.
In the early days, the infection rate was around 2%. By the time I left Harare 17 years later,
It soared to one in four.
In the mid-1990s, I sentenced hundreds of people in the prime of their lives to be AIDS positive.
I saw my colleagues, friends, students, and patients die.
In response, my colleagues and I opened a clinic.
We taught them how to use condoms.
Training was also carried out in schools and workplaces.
I also did research. The companions of the infected counseled them on how to protect themselves from the disease.
I worked hard, and I believed I was doing my best at the time.
As a doctor, I have done a great job of treating my patients. But he didn't argue for structural change.
Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has spoken candidly about his mistake in calling the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the Director of Peacekeeping Operations at the United Nations.
In his speech on the 10th anniversary of the Holocaust, he recalled: "I believed I was doing the best I could at the time, but when I looked back after the massacre, I realized that there was more I could or should have done, and that I could have informed and helped in advance."
As AIDS has devastated public health systems and killed an estimated 39 million people by the World Health Organization, I too feel remorse and regret for what I did earlier.
Until I was in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as advocacy for policy or political participation.
I was there as an expert in medical and epidemiology-related technologies.
My job, I had in mind, was to slow the spread of the disease by caring for patients and better understanding the pathways of disease transmission through research.
I knew that the marginalized sections of society were vulnerable to the threat of AIDS.
In the sugar plantations, which are more closed than any modern business, 60 percent of pregnant women were found to be infected with AIDS.
I tried to make it known that the fact of AIDS infection is not due to moral depravity, but to male chauvinist culture, forced migrant labor, and colonization.
Caucasians had lower rates of infection.
As health professionals, the tools we were given were very meager. They recommended lifestyle changes, condom use, and a reduction in same-sex companionship.
Infection rates continued to rise, and the most promising hope was a cure developed in the West, but the cost of getting it to Africa was too much. I believe that the cause of this great tragedy,
I didn't speak out about the inequity of access to treatment, the problems of the economic and political system. I justified my silence by saying that I was only a guest in this country, that if I gave a premature warning, I would be deported, and that I would no longer be able to care for patients or do essential research.
So I complied with the government's initial response to AIDS.
I didn't say my concerns out loud enough.
I think a lot of doctors, health professionals, think it's not my fault.
The Hippocratic Oath, which is a contract with the patient, signifies the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
And I gave each of my patients everything I could.
But I knew that disease arises from cracks in our society. I found that it wasn't just biology, but social disparities, marginalization, and discrimination based on race, gender, and class that had a bigger impact.
AIDS did.
Such was the case with the recent Ebola outbreak.
Paul Palmer, a medical anthropologist who studied AIDS in Haiti, calls this "structural violence." Structure is problematic because there are inherent inequalities in our society that vested interests are not aware of. Violence is because its consequences are as traumatic as premature death, suffering, and disease.
Without being aware of this social injustice, the patient's treatment is only secondary.
Warning them in advance is the first step towards public health rights and the way to tackle problems together and make real difference. So today, I'm not silent.
Even if the listeners are uncomfortable,
I say a lot of things, even if I'm uncomfortable with myself. Most of them are racial polarization or
It's about racism that has become commonplace. These are things that should no longer be in this country. Especially in the areas of medicine and public health.
But they're there, and we don't really care.
That's why it's my duty as New York's health commissioner to warn of the impact of racism on American health and how the violence by organizations and individuals that people of color encounter every day leads to 250 years of slavery, 90 years of racism, and 60 years of imperfect equality in America's sad history. In New York, the premature death rate, that is, the rate of death before age 65,
It is 50 percent higher for blacks compared to whites.
In 2012, Black women had more than 10 times the risk of dying in childbirth compared to white women.
And despite the enormous drop in infant mortality, black babies still have nearly three times the risk of dying in the first year compared to white babies. New York is no exception.
The results were similar to those obtained across the United States.
Recently, the New York Times reported that 1.5 million black men are missing across the country based on its analysis. Subsequently, you should be between the ages of 25 and 54
With 1 in 6 Black men in prison or premature deaths, young Black men face inequality and unilateral violence in their daily lives.
The recent rise of social movements, #BlackLivesMatter, is evident in hashtags. But at the same time, we can see their hardships and
It is important to remember that diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes and AIDS, as a result of the onset and consequences of numerous risk figures, slowly erode the lives of these people and even lead to premature death.
As #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I was disappointed and outraged that the medical community didn't even use the word racism in research or in the workplace.
My feelings will be conveyed to you as well.
Medical students often wear white coats to protest, but by and large, the medical community is silent about the impact of social discrimination on the spread of disease and mortality.
And I think about the personalized, precise medicine that modern medicine is aiming for, which is biologically or genetically developing therapies, and that this movement has a side effect on the fact that the daily life we live, grown, work, and love has the greatest impact on public health and that so many people are disadvantaged.
I'm afraid I'll make you forget. As health professionals in our daily lives, every time we practice medicine or conduct research, we are aware of a huge injustice. A homeless person who cannot follow the prescription because his life is more urgent than his own illness, a transgender young person who considers suicide because he cannot endure the discrimination of our society, or a person who blames himself for his child's illness
There was also a single mother who felt it. As health professionals, our role is not only to treat patients, but also to warn and urge change.
Rightly or wrongly, our social status empowers our words, and we should not waste this power.
Regretting what happened in Zimbabwe, I pledged that as New York's Director of Public Health, I would be willing to give a forewarning and spare no effort to support the movement toward health equity. I'm against racism,
We want your help. And I'm here to help you when you talk about sexism or other discrimination. Now we stand up
Together, it's time to speak out about structural inequality. How do I have to change?
You don't have to be one-size-fits-all. All we need is courage.
The health of our patients, and all of us, depends on it.
Raise your hand if you've ever blocked someone on Facebook for making offensive comments about politics, religion, parenting, or food.
Or do you have at least one person you want to avoid?
In the old days, if you wanted to have a polite conversation, all you had to do was follow what Henry Higgins said in "My Fair Lady." "Talk only about the weather and health."
But these days, because of topics like climate change and the vaccine hesitancy... Those topics are dangerous, too.
We live in a world where every conversation has the potential to turn into an argument, where politicians can't talk to each other, and where someone passionately debates the pros and cons of the most trivial issues. It's abnormal.
A Pew Research Institute study of 10,000 adult Americans found that we are now the most polarized and divided in history.
They're less likely to compromise. I mean, they don't listen to other people.
Where we live, who we marry, and even who we make friends with depends on our beliefs.
It means that you don't listen to others.
Conversations need to be balanced between speaking and listening. But at some point, we lost that balance.
To some extent, it's because of the development of technology.
We always have our smartphones with us, or we always have them right next to us so we can pick them up at any time.
According to the Pew Institute, one in three American teens sends more than 100 texts every day.
And the majority of teens text more than they do face-to-face with friends.
There was an interesting article in the monthly magazine The Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
Mr. Barnwell asked his students about a certain topic.
I was given an assignment to speak on the spot without taking notes in a notebook.
And Mr. Barnwell said,
"I realized that the art of conversation is the most underrated skill that is not being taught."
Children spend hours every day interacting with screens, but they don't have much opportunity to hone their person-to-person conversation skills.
It may be a weird question, but let's ask ourselves. Is there a more important skill needed in the 21st century than being able to communicate logically and confidently?
My job is to talk to people. Nobel laureate, truck driver billionaire, kindergarten teacher, head of state, plumber...
I talk to people I like and people I don't like.
Personally, I also talk to people with whom I very disagree, but
Still, we have a good conversation.
So I'm going to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to speak and how to listen.
I'm sure many of you have already heard some advice on this. For example, look them in the eye, think about an interesting topic in advance, nod your head, smile to show that you're listening, repeat what you just heard, or summarize it.
Forget all this advice.
It's.
If you're really paying attention, you don't need to learn to let them know you're listening.
Even in casual conversations, I
I use the techniques I use when I do a professional interview. So, I'm going to help you improve your conversational skills.
We'll teach you interview skills. Not worth your time, not boring, not hurting others' feelings
Learn how to have a conversation.
We've all had good conversations. I've done it before, so I know what a good conversation looks like. Immersive, inspiring,
It's a conversation that feels like it's really connected or completely understood.
Most of your conversations don't say you can't. Here are 10 basic rules. I'll tell you all about them in detail, but even if you master just one of them,
You can have a much better conversation.
First, don't do multiple things at once, whether it's your phone, tablet, car keys, or anything else you have in your hand.
I'm not just telling you to put it down.
Live in the moment.
Stay focused.
The argument I had with my boss earlier, tonight's dinner menu
Don't think about that. If you want to end the conversation you're having, don't focus on it vaguely and leave the conversation.
Second, don't preach.
If you only want to express your opinion and don't want to react, argue, refute, or grow, write on your blog.
The reason I don't have current affairs commentators on my shows is because they're boring people.
If you're a conservative, you're going to hate Obama, or welfare, or abortion.
If you're a progressive, you don't like big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
It's totally obvious.
You can't do this.
Always approach the conversation with the mindset that you have something to learn.
The famous psychotherapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening is about letting go of yourself.
This means that there are times when you have to let go of your personal opinions.
According to him, when the speaker feels that the listener is receptive, he becomes more vulnerable and more open.
Again, always think there's something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone you meet knows something you don't know."
In my own words, everyone is an expert in some field.
Third, ask questions that you feel free to answer.
Learn from the way journalists write.
Start your question with a sixth principle.
When you ask complex questions, you get simple answers.
I asked, "Were you afraid?" If you ask,
You'll respond to the most intense word in the question, fear, and say "yes" or "no."
"Were you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let the respondent describe it themselves. You know how you feel.
"How was it?" Me: "How did you feel?" Ask the same question
Ask.
The answerer will have to think for a moment and come up with a more interesting answer.
Fourth, follow the flow of the conversation.
It means that when a thought pops into your head, you have to put it out of your head.
In some interviews, a guest has been talking for a few minutes and then the moderator suddenly asks a question that has already been answered.
This means that the moderator had a very pointed question in mind, and for two minutes he stopped listening and waited for the right time to ask the question.
We do the same thing.
I'm sitting down talking to someone, and suddenly I remember meeting Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop the other day.
Then we stop listening.
A topic or an idea will come to mind.
Still, you have to let it go.
Fifth, if you don't know, say you don't know.
These days, people on the radio, especially public broadcasting, are wary of saying, 'I know for sure because I'm an expert in this field,' because they know that what they're saying is being recorded.
Be overly careful.
Conversation should not be frivolous.
Sixth, don't equate your experience with someone else's.
If someone talks about the death of a family member, don't talk about the time you lost a family member.
If someone says their job is hard, don't complain about your job.
It's never the same thing.
Every experience is different.
First of all, you're not the center.
You don't have to use the moment to brag about yourself or complain about yourself.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, and he replied, "I don't know. Anyone who boasts IQ is a scumbag." I said.
Conversation is not an opportunity to brag about yourself.
Seventh, don't repeat what you said. I feel like I'm being smug and I'm really bored. But we do it often.
Especially at work or when I'm talking to my kids, if I have a point I want to say, I end up repeating the same thing.
Don't do that.
Eighth, don't obsess over details.
Honestly, listeners aren't interested in the exact year, name, or date you're trying to remember. I'm interested in you.
I care about who you are and what you have in common.
So I forget about the details. You don't have to tell me.
Ninth, not the last, but the most important.
Listen.
So many great people have said countless times that listening is perhaps the most important skill you can develop. The Buddha said, "If your mouth is open, you are not learning."
President Calvin Coolidge said, "No one has been fired for being too keen."
Why don't we listen?
First, because we want to talk.
When I speak, I control the conversation.
You don't have to listen to things that don't interest you.
I'm getting attention
It strengthens your identity.
But there's another reason, too. We distract ourselves.
The average person speaks 225 words in a minute, but can hear up to 500 words in a minute.
So I'm filling in the other 275 words in my head.
I know. It takes a lot of effort and energy to focus on other people. But if you're not focused, you're not talking.
It's just two people throwing unrelated sentences in the same time and space.
We need to listen to each other.
Stephen Kirby said,
"We do not listen to understand, but to answer."
Finally, tenth, be short.
'A good conversation is a miniskirt. It's short enough to keep you interested, and long enough to cover the topic.' -My brother In the end, there's one basic principle behind it all. Take an interest in others.
I was raised by a famous grandfather, so there was a kind of ritual in the house.
When someone came to talk to my grandparents, my mom would let me know by asking me if I knew who they were.
"She's Miss America.
He's the mayor of Sacramento.
He's a Pulitzer Prize winner. She's a Russian ballerina."
So I grew up thinking that there was something hidden and amazing about everyone.
I think that made me a good moderator.
I keep my mouth open as much as possible, I always be ready to be surprised, and I never disappoint.
So do you.
Get out there and talk to people, listen to them, and most of all, be prepared to be amazed.
I appreciate it.
How do you do.
My name is Matthew Williams. And I'm a champion.
I was proud to have won multiple medals in three sports at the Canadian National Championships, competed in basketball competitions at the international level, and represented Canada on the global stage.
I train for basketball and speed skating 5 days a week. With the best coaching staff and psychiatrists, I strive to be the best in my sport.
All of this is made possible through the Special Olympics.
Has this changed your mind about me and my accomplishments?
The world doesn't see everyone like me as a champion.
Not so long ago, people like me were shunned and had to be hidden.
Since the inception of the Special Olympics in 1968, many things have changed, but for the most part, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to many people.
People use the word '' in front of me and think it doesn't matter.
The word is '' or '' and is used in an abusive and derogatory way.
They don't think about how much these words hurt me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here for charitable purposes.
I'm here because I still have a big problem with the way a lot of people view people with intellectual disabilities, or because too many don't even recognize them.
Did you know that there was a convention this year?
I was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who gathered in Los Angeles for the Special Olympics.
More than 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, which was broadcast live on TSN and ESPN.
Did you know if this ever happened?
What do you think when you see someone like me?
I want you and me to see us as equals here today.
Special Olympics change the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities
It also changes the perspective of everyone who watches. For those of you who don't know,
The Special Olympics are for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
This is separate from the Paralympics or the Olympic Games. We want to change the quality of life and the way people look at athletes with intellectual disabilities.
This movement has changed not only my life, but many others' lives as well. And the whole world is trying to make people with intellectual disabilities
It has also changed the way we look at things.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
When I was younger, I played hockey until I was 12 years old. The bigger I got, the harder it was for me to keep up with the other kids, so I was frustrated and angry.
I haven't done any exercise in a while. I didn't have many friends, and I felt lonely and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one knew that they would become a sportsman or a valuable part of society.
In the 1960's, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of regular exercise on the health levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
After a thorough scientific study, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that children with intellectual disabilities had poor health levels because they lacked the opportunity to participate in sports.
Many doubted that health programs and athletic competitions would be of great benefit to the intellectually disabled.
But Dr. Hayden and the founder of Special Olympics, Eunice Kennedy Schriefer, were undeterred as pioneers, and Special Olympics athletes proved them right 4.5 million times.
Before joining the Special Olympics, I was very anxious. Because I was young, timid, unconfident and didn't have many friends.
But when I stepped on that stage, everyone encouraged me, supported me, and helped me to be myself, regardless of what others were thinking.
I am now a basketball player and a speed skater. He competed in several provincial and national tournaments, including this year's Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, where he was the first Canadian basketball team to compete in a world championship.
I'm one of more than 4.5 million athletes in the world, and I've heard a lot of similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics athlete restores our self-esteem and self-esteem.
Special Olympics also address important health needs.
Numerous studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years earlier than the general population, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years earlier than the general population.
Special Olympics keep us healthy by keeping us moving and engaging in exercise.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
In addition, the Special Olympics offer free health screenings for athletes who have difficulty communicating with doctors or who do not have access to health insurance.
At the 2015 Summer Olympics, my Canadian teammates and I played against the Nigerian national basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian team attended a World Games athlete health check-up, and 7 out of 10 athletes received free hearing aids, allowing them to hear for the first time in their lives.
The changes that came to them were tremendous.
They were more excited, happier, and more confident. I was able to communicate verbally with the bishop.
I was also thrilled. You can hear the basketball, you can hear the whistle, you can hear the crowd cheering -- because of these sounds that are so obvious to us.
Special Olympics don't just change athletes in one sport.
It's changing their lives off the pitch.
Studies this year have shown that half of the U.S. adult population doesn't know a single person with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans who have no personal connection to intellectual disability have much less respect for it.
And then there's the word ''. Still, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to so many people.
People use this word as a light word or as a swear word.
The word has been mentioned more than 9 million times on Twitter in the last year, and it hurts me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world.
A lot of people think this isn't insulting, but it's not.
My colleague and Global Messenger John Franklin Stevens publicly responded to a political pundit who used the word '' as an expletive. "Join us at the Special Olympics sometime.
Let's see if you can walk away with your heart unchanged. "
This year, at the 2015 Summer Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the weightlifting final.
In the end, it was standing alone, and my proud teammate Jackie Barrett deadlifted 297kg and lifted 277kg from a squat position. It was the best record in the history of the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the record holder of all weightlifters in Newfoundland. Not just in the Special Olympics, but all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge star in Los Angeles, and ESPN tweeted about his performance in real time, admiring his game.
Fifty years ago, not many people thought that people with intellectual disabilities could accomplish such a thing.
This year, 60,000 spectators packed the seats at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games, cheering on athletes from 165 countries from around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were cheered on and celebrated.
Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud.
The Special Olympics teach the world that people with intellectual disabilities are part of our society that deserves respect.
I now have dreams, I have achievements, I have great coaches, I have respect and self-esteem, and I'm much healthier in my sport. Now I'm trying to become a personal trainer.
I'm no longer hiding or being teased, I'm here to give a TED talk.
The world has changed a lot thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet someone with an intellectual disability, look at his talent.
The next time someone around you uses the word ''', I want you to know how much it hurts.
We also want you to participate in the Special Olympics.
One last thing.
Nelson Mandela once said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
Special Olympics are changing the world. We're transforming 4.5 million athletes, giving them a place to stand more confidently, meet their friends, not be judged, feel like a champion, and be a champion.
I appreciate it.
You may not have heard of Kenema or Arua.
But I know they are two of the most bizarre places on earth.
The hospitals there are communities of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have been quietly confronting humanity's deadliest threat for years. Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
It can cause severe febrile and can be very fatal.
And yet they risk their lives every day to protect those who are here, and to protect all of us.
But the most bizarre thing I learned about them when I first visited them a few years ago was that they start their tough days on the front lines with a song.
They come together to share their joy,
Show their fighting spirit.
And over the years, when I visit them or when they visit me, we get together and sing and write and have fun. Because it tells us that we're here just to pursue science, and that we're united by a strong sense of humanity that we share.
As you might think, that process has become very important and essential even when something changes.
And when an Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea in March 2014, it changed a lot of things.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa. The outbreak occurred near the border of Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And it was very scary, we were all afraid.
We actually suspected for some time that Lhasa and Ebola would spread more widely than we thought, and that one day it would enter Kennema.
So members of my research team were immediately dispatched to join Dr. Humark Khan and his team to prepare precise molecular diagnostics to make sure that if Ebola crossed the border into Sierra Leone, they would be able to detect it immediately.
We had already built this system against the Lassa virus, so we knew how to deal with it this time. This team is very good.
All we had to do was provide them with the tools and a place to investigate Ebola
And sadly, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's obstetrics and gynecology department, and team members performed critical molecular diagnostics to identify the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
This was a brilliant thing.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, safely treat the patient, and begin contact tracing to determine what happened.
Maybe it could have stopped something.
But by the time that day came, Ebola had been multiplying for months.
With hundreds of cases, it has already surpassed the diseases that have occurred in the past.
And it's not just one case in Sierra Leone, it's a tidal wave.
We worked with the international community and the Ministry of Health and Kinema to deal with a number of cases, 31 cases a week, then 92 cases, then 147 cases, all of which came to Kenema, the only place in Sierra Leone that we could handle.
And while we were doing everything we could 24 hours a day, trying to help people, trying to get noticed, we did one simple thing.
From samples taken from patients' blood to detect Ebola. Of course, you can dispose of the specimen.
All we could do was put the chemicals in it and deactivate it, put it in a box and ship it across the ocean, and we did.
I sent them to Boston, where my team works.
We continued to work tirelessly every day, and we created 99 genomes of the Ebola virus.
This was the blueprint. The genomic blueprint of the virus.
We all have it.
It tells us about everything that makes us who we are, and it tells us a lot of information.
The results of these experiments are very simple and impactful.
We were able to look at and compare these 99 different viruses. And I knew. In fact, by comparing three genomes from the previous outbreak in Guinea. We can show that it originated in Guinea a few months ago and has infiltrated the human race, and has been transmitted from person to person.
This is very important. To know how to intervene, but more than that, contact tracing.
We could see that the virus was mutating as it spread from person to person.
And each mutation was very important because the different diagnostics, the vaccines, the treatments that we were using, all of these were based on the gene sequence that fundamentally drives the virus.
So the world's health professionals had to react to this, develop it, re-evaluate everything they were doing.
But where I was at that point, the way science worked would be to collect data, work in isolation for months, analyze the data very carefully and slowly, propose a paper to publish, look around, and finally distribute that data when it was published.
This is exactly how the current situation works.
But it won't work at this point, right? Right?
We had friends on the front lines and what we obviously needed was help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was, as soon as the genome sequences were identified on the machine, we put them out on the web.
I put it out there and said, "Help me."
And then the helping hand came.
Before we knew it, people from all over the world contacted us, and they were surprised to see the data that was made public.
At some point, some very amazing virus trackers joined our community.
We worked together virtually. Sharing, regular phone calls, communication, etc. I was following the virus moment by moment and trying to find different ways to stop it.
There are many ways to create these communities.
Especially as disease outbreaks spread around the world, everyone reached out to learn, participate, and get involved.
Everybody wanted to play a role.
The amount of human capacity shown here is quite astounding. And the internet has connected us all.
Instead of us being in fear of each other, you can say, "Let's do this.
Let's work together to make it happen." Can you imagine that?
But the problem was with the material we were all using. Googling on the web was limited in what we were supposed to do.
And when that happens, you miss a lot of opportunities.
At the beginning of the pandemic, we had 106 patient clinical records, and we released them to the world again.
And in our lab, we were able to give you access to 106 records and train the computers to predict the prognosis of Ebola patients, with 100 percent accuracy.
We also created an app to distribute it so that medical workers in the field could use it.
But the number 106 wasn't strong enough to make it stand out.
So we're waiting for more resources to distribute.
The materials still haven't arrived.
We are still waiting in isolation and improving. Instead of working together.
And that's not going to be acceptable.
Isn't it? I don't think all of you will be able to accept it either.
Our lives are at stake.
And in fact, many lives were lost. A lot of medical staff, including my beloved colleagues, five colleagues: Embaloo Forney, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Koboma and Mohamed Pula.
These are five of the many medical workers who died in Kenema and beyond, while the world was waiting, when we were all working, quietly, apart.
You know, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is exacerbated by distrust, dispersion, and division.
When we build barriers between ourselves and fight each other, viruses thrive.
But unlike everything that threatens humanity, there is one place where we are all human beings as equal: Ebola.
We're all in this fight.
Ebola disease in one family can be ours at any moment.
So here, with the same vulnerability, the same strength, the same fear, the same hope, I hope we can work together with joy.
One of my graduate students was reading a book about Sierra Leone and discovered that the hospital where we worked and the city where we worked in Sierra Leone, the word "kenema" comes from a Mendee word that means "clean, transparent, and open to the public eye, like a river."
It surprised us all. Because before we knew it, we always felt it. In order to honor the people of Kenema, where we worked, we had to work openly, share, and work together.
And it has to be.
We all need to demand from ourselves and from others. When illness strikes, we need to open up to each other and tell each other to fight together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola. And it's not the last one. Lots of microbes waiting outside. There's a lot more to it than just the Lassa virus.
And the next time it happens, it can happen in a city of tens of thousands of people.
It could be an airborne disease.
You can spread it on purpose.
I know it's scary, but I also know this, and this experience shows us that we have the skills and ability to overcome this. They win and get the upper hand against the viruses.
But we can only do it together, and we do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan, and for the countless people who have sacrificed on the front lines of this fight with us, let's always be with them in this fight.
Let us not be defined as a world destroyed by a virus, but let us unite and let the hearts and minds of billions of people shine.
I appreciate it.
