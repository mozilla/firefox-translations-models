The flow of traffic is a study on individual drivers and movements of vehicles and interactions they operate to each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the driver’s behavior cannot be 100% certain.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a fairly consistent range. Therefore, the traffic flow has a moderate consistency and can be expressed in mathematically.
To express the flow of traffic better (1) flow, (2) density, (3) relationship between three main characteristics of speed was set.
These relationships are helpful in planning, design and operation of road facilities.
