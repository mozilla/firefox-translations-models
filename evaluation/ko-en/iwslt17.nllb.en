This is the story of how we know what we know.
This story is about this woman, Natalya Lifczyński.
She is an archaeologist, that is, she specializes in excavating things that have died long ago.
Natalya Lifczyński: Yes, they also call me "Dr. Deadly".
Ratko Ratif Nasa: And what interested me about her was where she sells goods.She works in the remote Canadian tundra region far above the Arctic Circle.
One summer day in 2006, she was at the Fyles Leaf Bed, an excavation site not less than 10 degrees below the horizon in the Antarctic.
It wasn't a big deal at all because I was walking around all day with my GPS and laptop in my backpack, all day with what looked like fossils.
Rattif: And in a moment she realizes something.
It was melted, melting in color, and I had something to touch my hand.
I was just lying on the ground.
Rattif: At first, I thought she was just a piece of wood, because people had previously discovered prehistoric plant fossils at Fyles Leaf Bed.
But that night, I came back to camp.
Natalya: I pulled out the portable headset and looked a little closer and realized that this is not what you see with a nightgown.
I thought that maybe it was something that needed to be preserved.
It looked like a bone.
So over the course of 4 years she kept exploring the area and eventually collected 30 pieces of the same bone, most of them very small pieces.
NATALIA: It's not a great thing, but we'll all be in the same zip code.
Rattif: And she tried to match the bones like a puzzle.
But it was a very difficult task.
Natalya: I cut too many pieces and used sand and adhesives, but it didn't look good.
So, eventually, I took the picture with a 3D scanner.
Natalya: Yes, did you do well?
Ratko Rautif: In fact, that was a much easier way.
Natalya: It felt like magic to make the pieces one.
Rattif: How sure were you that these pieces were put together properly?
Was it possible that the collection was not well done, perhaps a small ink or the bone of something else?
NATHALIA: Well, no, no, no, you did the right thing.
Ratif: According to her, what she found was a cranial bone, a leg bone, and precisely the leg bone of a breastfed mammal with broken ankles, an animal like a sheep or a son.
But these two animals were not the same.
Because the bones were too large.
Natalia: It was really big, it was a very large animal bone.
Rajiv: So what kind of animal is it?
While thinking about it, she showed a piece to a colleague in Colorado and they gave her a good opinion.
Natalya: We cut the piece out of the end with a spike and the gaps came up with a really interesting smell.
RATIF: It smelled like meat.
The smell was the smell she smelled when she was in a crappy anatomy class.
Collagen reverses the structure of the bone.
And usually over time, it collapses.
But in this case, the Arctic was preserved by natural cooling and re-activation.
Then, one or two years later, Natalia sees her colleague Mike Berkeley at a conference in Bristol demonstrating a "collagen mark".
The content is that different species have slightly different collagen structures, so if there is a collagen structure of unknown bone, it is possible to compare it with the structure of the identified species, and if there is a match, we may not know.
So she sent a piece to a colleague, a FedEx.
Natalya: Yes, I'm trying to confirm the delivery, it's important.
Rattif: And he analyzed and compared 37 species of modern mammals identified with modern species of mammals.
I found a match.
The results of the study showed that this bone was a 3.5 million year old bone, and that the owner of this bone, which Natalya had found in the Arctic, was...
It was a camel.
Natalya: At the time, I said this.What?It's amazing--if it's true.
So we tested the other pieces too and the results were all the same.
But based on the size of the bone found, this camel was 30% or more larger than the modern camel.
Then this camel is 9 feet tall and weighs about 1 ton.
Yes, it is.
Natalia discovered a giant Arctic camel.
Now, this is what you may have thought when you heard the word 'camel': the twin-horned camel from East Asia, Central Asia,
I don't know if you have in your minds this one-horned camel that usually appears in a leaflet.It is a typical desert animal that lives in hot desert areas, living in places like the Middle East or the Sahara, and relying on a large crane to store water for long desert treks, it crosses the sand dunes with large, wide legs.
So how did these friends get to the Arctic?
Well, scientists knew a long time ago that what was revealed before the discovery of Natalya was that the camel actually came from the United States.
This is where the camel first appeared.
Camels first appeared about 40 to 45 million years ago and only inhabited parts of North America.
Rattif: If you compare all the camels, can you tell the difference between them?
Natalya: Yes, camels vary in size and shape from one to another.
Some camels have very long horns, and are actually a camel-like giraffe.
Rafi: Which species has a crocodile-like spine?
Natalya: The early stage camel was really, really small, almost like a rabbit.
What, a camel the size of a rabbit?
Natalya: Go to your original stage camel.
It's probably hard to see a camel.
My God, I want to raise a rabbit camel.
Natalya: So am I. Wouldn't that be good?
Ratko Latif: And about three hundred to seven million years ago, one camel species crossed into South America, where it evolved into the llama and alpaca, while the other species crossed the Bering-Meat Bridge into Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the Ice Age, the North American camel became extinct.
Scientists knew all this, but they could not fully explain what Natalia had found in the north of the island.
For example, in terms of temperature, the extreme latitude is the exact opposite of the Sahara.
To be precise, 3.5 million years ago, the average temperature was about 20 degrees Celsius warmer than today.
So the Arctic would have been the forest of the Achaemenid Sea, like the Yukon or Siberia of today.
But still, it was a winter zone that lasted for six months, and the water pool froze.
It must have been where the snow had fallen.
It would have been a region of a desolate wasteland that lasted for 24 hours.
How... how?
How did this Sahara superstar survive in the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her colleagues come up with a hypothesis.
And it was a pretty ingenious idea.
What if the camels we think can adapt well to a place like the Sahara have actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the camel's broad legs were not for crossing the desert but for walking on snow?
What if the camel's crust - which was big news for me - contained fat, not water, and this would help to grow the six months of winter without food?
And what if later the camel crossed the Beringko Bridge and adapted these features to winter long afterwards for a hot desert environment?
For example, it will help with the back or hot climate because body fat is concentrated in one place, like a fat pad, so no insulation covering the whole body is needed.
The crust on the back makes it easy to block heat.
It may sound strange, but the essential reason why a camel can survive in the desert is that it may have been evidence that in the past it lived in the Arctic.
In fact, I'm not the first to tell this story.
Others see this as a marvel of evolutionary biology or as a key to future climate change.
But the reason I like this story is different.
I think this is the story of us, of how we view the world and how it changes.
I am a historian.
And many scientists have come to realize that they are like a historian.
That it is the same thing to prove the past.
Scientists also talk about the universe, the Earth, life on Earth.
And as a historian, I thought about where this story would lead.
Natalya: We make hypotheses and I think the hypothesis is true, like camels living in the desert, right?
I was absolutely convinced.
As you can see, camels live in the desert.
RATAF: But at some point you discover very little evidence.
It's that little thing that can overturn everything you've ever known.
In this case, a scientist discovered a piece of wood that he thought was a tree and with it the scientific community had a completely new and semi-regular theory as to why this Dr. Seuss-like animal looked like this.
And for me, the idea of a camel was completely reversed.
From an absurdly rare animal that can only grow in certain environments to an animal that travels the world and arrives in the Sahara.
This friend is Azariko.
Azuri, hello! how are you?
Here, eat one of these.
Azukoli is currently taking a break during a regular performance at Radio City Music Hall.
I'm not kidding.
The reason Azzi came here is to tell people that the story of this world is dynamic.
We need to adapt and reimagine.
Isn't that right, Azary?
And in fact, a small piece of bone has transformed the world we see.
Thank you.
Today's computers are so amazing that it's hard to realize how terrible they are at the same time.
Today I will be introducing the problems of computers and showing how to solve them through neuroscience.
First, let me tell you about an important event that happened to me on a cold night in Harlem in 2011.
I was sitting in a bar outside Columbia University, where I majored in computer science and neuroscience, and I was in a bar with a friend and had a conversation about how the hologram would one day replace the computer.
And as our conversation reached its peak, a friend's cell phone rang.
The friend pulled the phone underneath and looked down and began typing.
And then he raised his eyes and looked at me, saying, "Hold on.
But the friend's eyes were not hot, and the moment had already passed.
Meanwhile, another student on the other side of the street was taking out his cell phone and handing it to the same person.
He was passing on Instagram photos and laughing happily with the accompanying actor.
I was struck by the fact that my feelings were hurtful and at the same time that the other side was happy because of the same technology.
And as I thought about it, I realized that the content of the digital information itself did not produce different results, but rather that my friend and I were separated by the direction of the screen and the other side was connected.
Connecting those friends to cell phones was like having an old ancestor sit around a fire and talk and socialize.
I think tools should work like this.
It should be the body's extension line.
And I think today's computer is the opposite.
Whether you're emailing your wife, writing a symphony, or comforting a friend, it's the same thing on the computer.
You can face the rectangles and tap the button and menu to create a different rectangle.
I think this is wrong because I think we can use a much more natural machine.
We need to use machines that do things in the real world.
We must apply neuroscience principles to machines so that we can expand our senses without interfering with our senses.
There is such a machine right here right now.
This is Meta 2.
Let's try it out.
I can see my hands and the audience in front of me.
Now I have a very sympathetic hologram in the form of a hologram, right in front of the device I am currently working on.
This hologram is also a product we shop for, a search engine, and can move with our hands and with our hands.
Iron Man is a sight to be proud of.
I'll see you again in a little while about this machine.
If you're like me, you're probably imagining what's possible with this technology, so I'll show you.
Naturally, I thought of rendering architecture in 3D, not 2D design as it is now.
Mom also touches the graphics and chooses the interior decoration.
This scene is a video shot in real life from Meta 2.
The following example, which I have a sympathetic connection with, is a transparent brain project by Professor Adam Gazalli, approved by UCSF.
As a neuroscientist, I always imagined learning and screaming about the complex structures of the brain with the help of machines, touching and playing with complex brain structures.
But I think it goes beyond this to the process of expanding the capabilities of our bodies with the help of machines, not the other way around.
Now, now...
In a few years' time, mankind will experience a major transformation.
Humanity will begin to build up a layer of digital information that matches the real world.
Imagine the change that this will bring to us, the storyteller, the painter, the brain surgeon, the interior decorator.
And I think that as we all work together and discuss the ways to create this new reality through a lot of effort and effort, we should think about how to expand the human experience and not just make it a game or fill it with information.
And I am very passionate about this work.
Now, let me tell you a little secret.
In about 5 years, this will be a fine glass strap that will project a hologram into the eye, and as we choose to look at an operating system that is not hardware when we buy a cell phone, I have always dreamed of creating an iOS for the mind as a neuroscientist.
The development of this OS needs to be very careful, because the life expectancy in the new OS can be as long as we use Windows.
For those of you who don't know, I'm afraid to live in Windows.
To find the most intuitive interface for the user, we put neuroscience at the heart of design, and the landscape that shapes the design in the conference room is invisible.
A principle we always remember when designing is to find neural circuits with the least amount of hyperactivity.
At every stage, we try to connect the iOS of the mind to the intuition of the brain.
We are building computers that we can use intuitively.
The following three design guidelines will help you to create a new user experience.
These are the things we seek. The first most important thing is that we are pursuing them.
You are the operating system yourself.
The existing file system is not complicated or intuitive, but it forces your brain to understand more.
That is, the lowest-temperature circuit does not pass.
In augmented reality, on the other hand, you can place the hologram on the TED screen here, the email on the other side, and you can use the spatial capabilities of reality to pull the hologram.
Tesla, which Tesla was shopping for, could be removed, as the legal team used the car before the speech, based on the model's consent.
The brain fully understands this process.
The second instruction is to look and cry.
When something attracts the attention of babies, how do babies react?
I reach out and try to touch him.
This is how a natural machine works.
It has been found that for the visual system to have a great effect, the sensation of self-consciousness, or the body's sense of where the system is, is needed.
Therefore, if you can touch it directly, you can not only understand the ease of manipulation but also the content.
It's about touching and seeing.
But experience alone is not enough.
We are social animals.
This is our third guide, a hologram's torch that spreads into the story.
Through the mirror neuron of the human body, we can immerse ourselves in working with others by looking at their faces and hands in 3D.
If you look at the video behind me, two meta users are playing together on the same hologram and interacting with each other, facing each other, not falling apart because of the device.
With the neuroscience I mentioned in mind, let's rewrite the device.
I'm back on iOS for the mind again.
This time I'll go further and place this device next to the next table I'll hold by the hand.
I am with you, and I will continue.
I can take this device and put it back in my place according to my spatial capacity because I am the operating system myself.
Now with the self-destruct sensor working, I can break this device into thousands of parts and touch the same sensor that is scanning my hand.
But I'm so excited to see it alone, I'll have a 3D conversation with co-creator Rayko.
Raiko, did you do well?
Gentlemen, I am looking at this man in 3D right in front of me.
As if it were real.
Thank you.
My mirror neurologist says that this feature will replace the phone in the near future.
Raiko, did you have a good time?
Well, we're going live.
Raiko, please present the hologram brain that I first showed to the audience.
Friends, this device will change not only the phone, but also the way we cooperate.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ray.
Something like that.
Guys, this is the message I found at the bar in 2011: the future of computers is not confined to a dimly visible screen.
Right here, right inside of us.
What I can tell you today is that natural machines are not the science fiction of the future, but are in 2016.
Because Meta has already created this device, hundreds of Meta executives, executives, designers, technicians will abandon all the monitors in the company before TED2017 and turn them into truly, truly natural machines.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, guys.
Chris Anderson: I have one question, and there have been a few Augmented Reality demonstrations outside before last year.
At times, there was a debate among technicians whether the demo scene was actually the user's view.
This is a problem with visual acuity, where the display image is not visible as wide as it actually is seen by a device.
Is it the same as it appears in the video?
MERON: Don't be like that.
Not only that, but through many adjustments, the camera captured all the video while taking the actual lens inside.
The video was shot to give the experience of actually using a device when watching video.
Chris: Thank you for your thoughtful attention.
Thank you so much, it's rewarding.
I come from Seattle, Washington, the most liberal, democratic, liberal, and progressive city in the United States.
I grew up in a family that believed Seattle was the best.
My mother was an artist and my father was a university professor, and I am so grateful for the upbringing I had, because I was able to design my life comfortably.
But in fact, I didn't follow my parents exactly as they wanted me to.
When I was nineteen, I dropped out of college, got kicked out, and was a big deal.
I went to see the dream professor Franko Horne.
I've played indoor music in the United States and Europe, and I've traveled with a great jazz guitarist named Charlie Bird over the years.
In my late teens, I was a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra.
What a wonderful life.
My parents never complained.
He has given me all the support I can.
It wasn't what they wanted.
Because his parents used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son is in the open".
And there was one conversation about my life that was a little uncomfortable, and I want to share it.
When I returned from Barcelona at the age of 27, I went to visit my parents at Christmas, and they were cooking in the kitchen with my mother.
My mother was too quiet.
Something was wrong.
I asked my mother, "Mommy, what are you thinking?"
"Your father and I are really worried about you", he said.
So I said, "So how am I supposed to be now?"
"I'd really like to tell everyone", said her mother, "have you ever voted for the Republican Party?"
Yes, I was actually a French horn player with no interest in politics.
But the parents learned what had happened and there was some confusion.
I have become a passionate supporter of capitalism, and I will tell you why.
That's because of poverty, a lifelong concern of mine.
Growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw poverty.
We were a little lower than the middle class, but not poor.
He didn't even get close to it.
I first saw the reality of poverty in the early 1970s when I was seven years old.
I was just an ordinary child.
I saw a picture of my teenage son in East Africa in the National Geographic magazine.He had a face full of fleas and an enlarged belly.
I knew he would not live.
Some of you may remember the photo, even if it's not one of them.
The West has been shown the endless poverty of the world.
That photo haunted me until I was old enough to go to school, dropped out of school, went back in and started a family.
And what would happen to the child,
I wondered what would happen to such people around the world.
So I started studying, even though I didn't go to college, trying to find the answer: What will happen to the world's poorest people?
Has it gotten worse or better?
I found the answer and it changed my life.
Look, most Americans believe that poverty has become worse than their childhood.
When asked, "Is global poverty at an all-time low?" 70% of Americans say the hunger problem is worse than it was in the early 1970s.
But the fact is that it's not.
It changed my mind.
Since 1970, the proportion of the world's hungry population living on less than $1 a day has decreased by 80 percent, adjusted for inflation.
Since I was a child, the world's poverty rate has decreased by 80 percent.
I didn't even know it.
It's a real miracle.
It's something we should celebrate.
This is the best record of poverty in human history, and it happened in this era we live in.
When I heard about it, I wondered how it could have happened.
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If we know why, we can lift two million other poor people out of poverty.That's our theme: At least two billion people have been lifted out of poverty since I was a young child.
I hope that the other two billion people will do the same.
I tried to find the answer.
Not a political answer that I'm not interested in.
I'm still not interested in politics.
I tried to find answers to every aspect of the economy.
The answer is this.
Let's see why.
There are five reasons why 20 billion people have been able to escape poverty.
The first is globalization.
The second is free trade.
Third: the right to poverty.
Fourth: the provisions of the law.
The fifth: creation.
The massive free-trade system that enabled that work spread around the world in the 1970s.
It's not a simple sound.
Free business isn't perfect, but it's not all we need to make a better world.
But it's a good thing.
Not political, but rather.
Here's what I learned: this is a revelation.
Capitalism is not about accumulation alone.
The ultimate of these is the idea of the four-man show, as many of those on the stage have said, that the four-man show came from a dream and was incorporated into the free enterprise.
I need to share it with more people. similar to the first one.
I'll tell you a second story, because I think it will improve the family and the world.
My favorite quote is a quote from what I said before: "Help people out of poverty".
They have lifted out a billion people from poverty.
Who could have said that?
You look like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
No, not at all.
President Obama said that.
How should I remember?
I told you so.
It was crazy.
I used to say "Hallelujah".
But beyond that, he said, "It's a good time".
You know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, there was an event at Georgetown University where we were the main participants.
And I think that's the biggest problem facing the United States today.
I thought it was the answer, what is it, with this thought, to progress and conservatism, to the one who needs us most.
I'm not saying we're in a crisis, the United States and many countries around the world are struggling with political polarization.
We are approaching a state of emergency.
It's not good, it's not right.
Last year, there was an article published in the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the Western Hemisphere.
And this is an article about political imbalance published in 2014.
What is the phenomenon that psychologists say their thoughts originate from love, while the other side believes they originate from hatred?
The correct answer is a common conflict.
It can also be seen in Palestine and Israel,
The author of this article found that most Republicans and Democrats in the United States today suffer from political imbalance.
Today's political activists believe that their motivation is persecution and that their opposition is hate.
Think about it.
If many people walk around and say, "You know, my thoughts are based on compassion, I want to help others, but others are the devil and they're bothering me", I'd be happy to.
Such a group with such imbalances will not be developed.
It is impossible.
How can we solve this problem?
Let's be honest: there is a difference.
The difference can be minimized: really pure.
A lot of research is needed.
This is veteran TED talk show host Jonathan Hyde.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He explores people's thoughts, values, morals to see the difference, and, as he has shown, I believe that Progressive and Democratic parties are different things.
For example, Jonathan Haight said that the Progressive Party cares about poverty 59% more than economic freedom.
And the Conservative Party is 28% more interested in economic freedom than poverty.
Is it a car that is impossible to separate?
You will never be able to reconcile.
It is to make the diversity of the world more powerful.
Remember what has plagued poverty.
The prohibition of economic freedom and the obsession with poverty spread throughout the world.
In other words, we need each other if we want to lift the next two billion people out of poverty.
There is no other way.
Oh, and that's right.
How do we do it?
It's not too complicated.
Innovative thinking is needed.
There are many of these things.
A social entrepreneur.Yes, of course.It is amazing.
We need foreign investment - in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way.
Do you know what's most important?
A flexible accident is needed.
We should be less predictable.
Isn't that right?
Don't you think our ideas have always been predictable?
It's a little bit of a mess.
Have you ever felt like you're always listening to someone who's sympathetic to you?
Why would that be dangerous?
We talk about the economy in this country, while conservatively we talk about taxes and regulation, and government.
And on the progressive side, we talk about income imbalances in the economy.
This is important, it is important to me and it is important to you.
But when you think of a hungry person, that's just a distraction.
To fight poverty as the best way, the Conservative Party needs progress and understands the Liberal Party's obsession with poverty, the Liberal Party needs the Conservative Party and understands the Liberal Party's obsession with free markets.
That's what will make this country even more rich in the future - diversity, if we realize it.
How should we do it, and how can we do it together?
There is a pattern of action for you and me.
First, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, first, second, second, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third, third,
But that's not all.
We also need to know that we need people who disagree with us because they need our solutions.
What will you do next, and how will you implement it?
Where do we start?
All of us here are blessed.
Because there is someone who listens to us.
Because we have been blessed with prosperity and blessed with leadership.
When people hear our stories about unpredictable thinking, they will probably listen.
From there, the development begins.
That's the first time.
Second, I ask you and myself whether it is possible to be such a vague and difficult to explain person who breaks the boundaries of difference.
If you are a conservative, be a hero to the poor, a conservative who always talks about poverty and moral duty.
And if you are a progressive, you remain that progressive party that discusses how to solve problems in the interests of a free market.
If we do, we have two advantages.
First, it will solve the problems of the next two billion people, and the solutions we have seen in the past should be seen in the future.
Second, we can turn the ideological conflict this country is experiencing into a competition of ideas through mutual respect.
And perhaps you will find that the difference is not so great.
Thank you.
When I was in college, I majored in political science, so I had a lot of homework to write.
The average student will break down the task this way when doing his homework.
You know, at first it starts a little slow, but if you do as much as you do in the first week, later you do more and everything ends up organized.
I want to do the same.
That's how they plan.
Everything will be ready, but when the task actually comes up, this is what happens.
This has happened with every task.
A graduation thesis of 90 volumes was also forthcoming, and a year was worth investing in.
I knew that this task was not to be done as usual.
Because it's too important a task to do.
So I made a plan and decided to do this.
Spending a year like this.
At first, it starts slowly, then a little faster in the middle, and then a little more steady at the end, like a little ladder.
How difficult would it be to climb a few steps?
It's not a big deal, is it?
But then something really funny happened.
The first few months were not as good.
It was just that time had passed and I hadn't done much.
So I made a great plan modification.
But then the middle of the month just passed and there was nothing to eat.
Two months became a month, and that became two more weeks.
And one day I woke up and found that I had only three days left on my schedule, and I had not written a single letter, so I did what I could. I spent 72 hours on 90 pages, and I spent two nights and two nights, not one day, but two nights, and then I jumped across campus and dived slowly, barely making it to the finish line.
I thought that was it.
Then a week later, a phone call came from the school.
"How's the team?" he asks.
I said, "Yes".
"We have a discussion to discuss", he said.
I said, "Do it".
"This is the best paper I've ever seen".
That never happened.
It was a very, very unfavorable paper.
I just wanted to enjoy a moment when you guys think, "This guy is awesome!"
No, no, no, it was really uncomfortable.
Anyway, I'm currently a blogger and writer.
I run a blog called "Why Wait".
A few years ago, I was going to write about the Miruga.
My behavior always disturbed those around me who do not postpone work, and I wanted to explain to them what goes on in the mind of the postponer and why we postpone.
I had one hypothesis: that the brains of people who postpone work are different from the brains of other people.
To verify this, I went to the MRI lab and scanned both sides of my brain and the brain of the unverified person and compared the two.
I have brought it to show you today.
Please see if there is any difference.
If you are not a trained brain specialist, the difference will not be obvious, but you should still take a look.
This is the brain of a man who never moves.
Now, now...
This is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both are "logical decision makers", but the delayed person's brain also has a "momental satisfaction monkey".
What does this mean for a person who postpones work?
That means that until this happens, everything will be fine.
[Because it's good to be doing it now.] [No!] A rational decision maker will make a rational decision to do productive work. But the monkey doesn't like it, so he grabs the wheel and says, "I want to read the Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kering and Tonya Harding scandal, because the scandal just came up.
Then, after a long time, you'll go to YouTube and watch the video of Richard Pineyman explaining the magnet, and then finally, after a long time, the video of Justin Bieber interviewing his mom.
This is all going to take a long time, so I don't have time to do anything today.
I'm sorry!" he said.
What is going on?
A momentary satisfaction monkey is not a kid who wants to be in the driver's seat.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
I have no memory of the past or knowledge of the future and only care about two things: easy and fun.
In the animal world, it would still be okay.
If you spend your life as a puppy doing nothing but fun and easy, then you're a successful life!
To this monkey, humans are just another species of animal.
All you need is to sleep well, eat well, and breed well, which would have been enough in tribal times.
I don't know if you know, but this is not the Tribal Era.
It is the age of advanced civilization and the monkey does not know what it is.
That is why there is another being in our brain, the "logical decision maker", who gives us the ability to do things that animals cannot do.
What can be the future, what can be the future, what can be the future?
You can see a large painting,
You can also set up a long-term plan.
Some rational decision makers try to take all of this into account.
I want to make it right now to do something that is reasonable, sometimes easy and fun.
There are times when it is appropriate, such as when eating dinner, going to bed, or having a good time, so there are overlapping parts.
Sometimes we are in agreement with each other.
But sometimes it is more reasonable to do work without having to be difficult and not having to be very enjoyable.
That's when conflict arises.
For the postponer, such conflicts always end in the same way, spending a lot of time in this orange-colored terrain, a simple and entertaining kingdom that is far from the rational realm.
I call it the "playground of darkness".
The playground of darkness is a place where postponers are well known.
Recreation is a place where recreational activities take place, and sometimes it is not.
The fun in a dark playground is not really fun, because it's not worth playing, because the air there is filled with guilt, fear, anxiety, self-loathing, all of which are feelings of procrastination.
The problem is how, in such a situation, when a monkey is scratching, the people who postpone work go to the blue ground, where less fun but important things happen.
Fortunately for a postponer, there is a guardian angel, always looking down on him and protecting him in the darkest moments, a creature called the panic monster.
The panic monster is mostly dormant, but wakes up suddenly when the exhausted nose comes forward, is publicly disoriented, is in danger of career disaster, or is at risk of a terrible setback.
What matters is that it is the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Until recently, he was a very close person in my life, because six months ago, a contact at TED invited me to a talk.
Of course, I decided to do it.
I always dreamed of giving a TED talk.
But while I'm excited and excited, I think the rational decision maker has a different opinion.
He said, "You know what we agreed to?
Do you have a clear understanding of what will happen in the future?
We should sit down and start right now".
The monkey says, "Once upon a time, I agreed, but now let's just open Google Earth and expand southern India to get a better understanding of India, then scroll upwards from 200 feet above sea level for two and a half hours until we reach northern India".
So that's what I did that day.
Six months turned into four months, two months, and one month, and a TED Fellow announced the speaker.
When I open the website, my face is staring straight at me.
Who will wake up?
So the panic monster starts to lose his mind and within seconds the whole system is in trouble.
Then the monkey, frightened of the panic monster, runs up the tree!
Finally, finally, a rational decision-maker could take the lead and do the talking.
The Panic Monster explains the behavior of the most accomplished people who postpone their work, how people like me who cannot write the first sentence of a task for two weeks find a miraculous work ethic and spend the night writing eight.
All of this is explained in three figures, and this is the system of the procrastinator.
It doesn't look very good, but it does have an effect in the end.
So I wrote about this in a blog a few years ago.
When I wrote a post, the reaction was amazing.
Literally thousands of e-mails were sent by a variety of people from all over the world doing a variety of different things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a huge number of PhD students.
They all said the same thing: "I have the same problem".
But what surprised me was that the blog post was a lightweight, and the email was a very serious, contrasted with the post.
These people were really putting off work and were very reactionary about what life was like, what the monkey did to them.
I thought, 'Why is this, when the system of the postponer is working, why is this?
Why are all these people in a dark place?
I learned that there were two kinds of misery.
In the example I have mentioned today, there was a limitation.
The results of the delay are limited to a short period of time because a panic monster is involved.
But the second kind of delay occurs when there is no deadline.
If you want to pursue a career in the arts or in business, there is no limit to this, because nothing happens until you get to work.
If the only reason a postponer can get a person to do these difficult things is a panic monster, that's a problem, because there is no end to all of this, and a panic monster doesn't show up.
So the consequences of procrastination are not limited, but just last forever.
This is a long-term, short-term, and less-than-exciting type of long-term delay, and it doesn't seem much better than the limited type, which is not discussed.
This can be a significant source of long-term unhappiness and regret, so I think that's why people sent emails.
That's why they're in a very bad situation, not because they're just skipping the task.
A long-term delay is like putting yourself out there.
This is because sometimes people feel like they are the eyewitnesses of their own lives.
I could not even begin to dream, so I read these emails and realized that there is no such thing as a person who does not delay.
You are all postponers too.
You may have a healthy, healthy mind that is finite, but remember, the subtle monkey trick comes when there is no limit.
Finally, I would like to show you one thing.
I call this a calendar of life.
In the 90 years of life, there is one box every week.
Not many boxes, especially since we've already used a lot of boxes.
I think this calendar needs to be looked at carefully for a long time.
We need to think about what we are putting off, because everyone is putting off something in life.
The monkey must always be aware of the momentary satisfaction.
That's what we all have to do.
There aren't many boxes left on the calendar, so we should probably start today.
Well, if not today, then...
Well, you know, I'm just saying,
One day soon.
Thank you.
That day we were all in the Texas church, soul and body, and we were spending the last day of our lives together.
The room here is similar to this one, but the old red cloth was spread over the spinning wooden chair, and the organ was on my left and the chapel was behind me.
But it was similar to this place.
Like here, tensions were running, full of hope of salvation, sweating hands, and those sitting in the back were not concentrating.
It was the night of Jesus' return on December 31, 1999, and I knew it was the end of the world.
I was 12 years old that year and I was old enough to feel responsible.
And as I got older to be responsible for my actions, I decided to stop complaining that it was unfair that Jesus was coming and to get the house cleaned up quickly.
So I went to church as often as possible.
I was so overwhelmed by the people's hard work to listen to the noise, to make sure God wasn't taking me first, and I decided to go home early.
Even though Jesus had returned, I read the "survivors" that were popular at the time and prepared an alternative.
The book says that if I don't get caught up in the excitement of midnight, there is a chance.
To do this, I had to avoid receiving the mark of the beast and fight the devil, the plague, and the antichrist.
It would have been difficult, but I believed I could do it.
But the time to plan has run out.
The clock pointed to 11:50 minutes.
Ten minutes before the return, the pastor called us out of the chair and told us to get out of the foundation because we wanted to pray at noon.
So all the faithful gathered and took their seats.
The church, the priest and his wives, as I like to call them, the Baptist bourgeoisie sat in front of the foundation.
In the United States, there are VIP seats on the day of Jesus' return.
The hot sun of a cotton farm in eastern Texas made their young days crumble, their unyielding, hard-brown skin burned like clay in east Texas, and their dreams and hopes for life outside of east Texas are sometimes more crumbled and broken than their crumbled backs.
The Iko adults were the main characters of the day for me.
They have waited their whole lives for this moment, as the medieval ancestors waited for the end of the world, and as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey show to be broadcast daily at 4pm on Channel 8.
I was firmly convinced that she would go to heaven and that she would hold her hand in prayer.
I thought I could go with you, so I held my hand and closed my eyes, listening and waiting.
The prayer became even more intense and the cry for answers to prayers became more loud.
The sound of the bell was increasingly loud.
Here the organ was adding a chorus.
The heat added sweat.
I grabbed her hand and tried not to be left alone.
I tried to close my eyes more and not to see people drifting away.
And as we prayed, a voice echoed over us. "Amen".
It's over.
I saw a clock on the ground.
The period had already passed.
I looked at the adults, but their savior did not come, and they were not slow to show disappointment, but they had believed too much and for too long, and now they were beginning to doubt.
I was angry at their condition.
They've always cheated, been snooped, and eaten snacks, and I've been right next to them.
I prayed for them and tried not to fall into temptation.
I have dipped my head twice in the bathtub, not once, which makes the nose run out.
I believed it so strongly.
What should we do now?
When I came home and turned on the TV, I could see Peter Jenningsko announcing the new millennium as he toured the world.
The thought that came to me suddenly was that it was strange that Jesus would travel the world and return in a timely fashion.
This made me even more ridiculous and really hurt.
But that day I did not lose faith there.
I just started to believe something new, that it is possible to believe in something that is not possible.
Because I may have the wrong answer or the problem itself may have been wrong.
And once a mountain-like conviction flowed from its source, a source of doubt, a source that promised a river.
I remember vividly the day that night in church when my Savior did not appear, and the day I learned that this was not a lie, but not the truth, knowing what I believed most.
Most of you will have taken Y2K in a different way, but I am sure you are here to see my talk because some of you have experienced the same as I have, since the beginning of the new millennium, since my mother left and my father left and the Savior did not appear.
I held hands and eagerly sought a place to rest my heart.
I entered Yale at the age of 18, with the faith I had grown up in Oak Cliff, Texas, and the many trials I had to face and the opportunity to turn back the scenery of broken hearts and bodies.
But when I came home one winter vacation, I found my face and two hands tied behind my back on the floor and a gun pointed at my head.
I also had faith in the Ryman Brothers, who interned in 2008.
Full of hope, he called his family and told them that we would no longer be poor.
But I witnessed this financial crumbling before my eyes and then realized that even the best job can't be saved.
I also built up my faith while working as a young employee in Washington DC, and what gave me confidence was the voice in Illinois that said, "It was very hard to come here, but this election will change America".
But when Congress failed and the entire country was in ruins, I realized that hope and change felt like a cruel joke and that the return of a political savior would not save me.
I knelt before the altar of the American Dream and prayed to the god of this age, the god of success money and power.
But I kept on waking up in the middle of the night and seeing that all these gods were dead.
In the midst of desperation, I began to search again, knowing that I was standing at the crossroads of faith or death, not courage.
So I went on a pilgrimage to another shrine, to Harvard Business School, knowing that this time the claimed salvation was simply not acceptable.
But I knew I had more to do.
It all started in a dark corner of a crowded party in the dreary late winter night of Cambridge, with a question I had with three friends and young people seeking the truth who had long asked, "What if we took a road trip in a car?"
We didn't know where to go, but we had to go.
Because we have longed for life, like a novel by Jack Kerouac, where "the night is hidden and disappears somewhere", and tried to find out how people around the country live.
So others said the risk was too great and the evidence was too weak, but we left anyway.
In the summer of 2013, I traveled 8,000 miles across the United States, through the Montana Plains, through the Detroit desert, through the New Orleans metro area, working with people there who were aligning the basic lines of life through the corporate taxation.
And as I approached Western capitalism, I was shocked by this innovative look.
And this idea grew into the nonprofit foundation 'MBAs Across America', the movement I am standing here today.
This movement spread as our generation longed for purpose and meaning.
The movement spread to the fact that countless entrepreneurs across the United States are creating jobs and changing lives and need a little help.
But to be honest, the movement spread because I fought.
I wanted to go anywhere to preach this gospel, to make more people believe that we can seam this torn country as one social enterprise.
But my journey to spread this gospel has led me to another gospel, the very gospel I want to share with you today.
About a year ago, one evening, there was a Harvard Business School fellowship at the Natural History Museum in New York.
I sat down with the giants of our time, and they celebrated their achievements with their colleagues.
The position was filled with pride, as the net worth and assets under management exceeded $500 billion.
It was great to see what we've accomplished together.
But another thing happened two days later: I went to preach the gospel in Harlem, and I sat on a farm in a once-populous city and heard Tony talk to me about the children who come out there every day.
All these children were living in extreme poverty.
Many children have been carrying everything they have in their bags, not to lose it in a homeless shelter.
Some of them join Tony's Harlem Grown and solve the only one of their day.
Tony said he started robbing the Harlem Grown of a pension from 20 years of taxi driving.
He said the reason he was stealing the pension was because the program was successful but needed sponsors.
He was willing to accept any help.
And I did that.
But as I broke up with Tony, I felt my eyes twinkle and tears pour in my eyes.
It was a revelation that one day in a room with hundreds of people with 500 billion dollars, and two days later in another room just 50 blocks away, someone was trying to feed a child until he gave up his pension.
Not because of the obvious inequality, not because of the thought of the hungry children floating on the streets, not because of the anger towards the top 1% or the compassion towards the other 99%.
I was heartbroken because I realized that I was just a prospective in this country where kidney transplantation is needed.
I realized that my story was about people who were being bullied by wearing boots and running shoes, and that the organizations I ran were about structural and systemic assistance that had not been available in Harlem, Appalachia, New Orleans, and that my voice was about people who couldn't learn, wash, and live.
And the shame about it began to come on, the same shame that Peter Jennings felt when he sat in front of the TV and shouted the new millennium over and over again.
I was deceived, blindfolded and confused.
But this time, the false savior was me.
You see, I have come a long way from that altar that night, when I thought the world was coming to an end, to a world where people claim that suffering is God's necessity and that the words in the Bible are absolutely true.
Yes, I have come a long way and I have come back to where I started.
Because we cannot simply say that we live in an age of unbelief, we have as much faith as countless others before us today.
Some of us may believe in the prophecies of Brene Browne or Tony Robbins.
Some of us may believe the New Yorker or the Harvard Business Review as the Bible.
We may believe most deeply when we gather here in the TED church to worship, but we must earnestly believe and believe.
We are like charismatic leaders, promising to solve all our problems.
We see suffering as the necessity evil of the capitalism we face and accept the technological advancement as an undeniable truth.
And we hardly realize the human cost of not having this little question, for fear of shaking our entire foundation.
But if you are sick of the unsound things we have accepted, it is time to question.
I am not talking about the gospel of collapse or reform or a new corporate measurement principle.
I'm not here today to preach the gospel of faith to you.
I have come to preach the gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt is not telling you not to believe, but rather telling you to believe something new, that it is possible not to believe.
Because the correct answer we have may be wrong, or those who believe it may be wrong.
Yes, the good news of doubt is that we all gathered here may be wrong.
Because this gospel raises the question "Why?"
The question we raised with our wholehearted hearts is, why should people still suffer so much?
This suspicion led to the closure of MBAs Across America, the organization I run.
We will leave our employees and close our doors and share our business model for free so that anyone with the ability to do this can do it without our permission.
Such doubts have led some to give up the role of Savior that I have been entrusted with, because our lives are too short and unlikely to wait for the Savior's return, in a world where there are no miracles.
When we are overwhelmed with anxiety, when the path before us seems to lead us to the end, when our healers cannot heal our wounds any more, our blind faith, not our humble doubts, become a small light in the darkness of our lives and the world, which we can raise our voices and whisper or whisper.
They will yell or simply say, very simply, "There must be another way".
Thank you.
Food shortages.
It's in the news every day.
What is the problem?
Because there are places in the world where food is scarce, whereas there are too many.
Somewhere GMO is saving the world.
Is it possible that GMOs are a problem?
Excessive agricultural waste polluted the oceans.
The cycle of evil continues.
And seeing this phenomenon is very powerful.
How can we feel this phenomenon through our skin?
How is this apple food shortage?
You may have eaten one or more apples recently.
How long do you think it would have taken to get rid of this apple?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11 months, the average age of an apology sold at a U.S. market.
There are real cases of loss of life because the chemicals used in the process of delaying the application process are harmful to the human body. How do you know this?
Why didn't I know?
When we eat this apple, we lose 90% of the nutrients, including the antioxidant enzyme.
This apple is just a lump of sugar.
How can we make this information shortage even worse?
What we lack is a platform.
Platforms and computers have connected me to the Internet since I was a child.
I also did a lot of strange things on this platform, which allowed me to meet people and express myself.
In food, how do you express yourself?
If we had a platform, we could automatically ask questions.
Why did I ask myself this question: If climate were equal?
This is a map showing the global climate.
The most productive regions are green, and the opposite is red.
California farmers have now become Mexican farmers.
China is trying to buy land in Brazil to grow quality food.
What if every country could have the best climate?
How would you change our lives?
How would quality of life and quality of food affect the quality of life?
The previous generation of food shortages was cheaper and required more food.
Welcome to the international farm.
We built a large analogue farm.
The line shown above is a transport route for cars, planes, trains, etc.
It is a miracle that only a small minority of society is engaged in agriculture and feeds seven billion people.
But if you are...
What if we built a digital international farm?
What if this app could be digitised by some technology, transmitted into the air, and reconfigured from the other side of the planet?
What if?
The quotes I will present next are inspirational to what I do.
The first: ["Japanese agriculture is water, land, young people, no future"] is an uncomfortable truth that I immediately experienced upon arrival at Minamisanliku, south of Fukushima, after the Great Depression.
The young men headed for Sendai and Tokyo, the land was contaminated and 70% of the food was foreign.
But this phenomenon is not limited to Japan.
Only 2% of Americans are involved in agriculture.
How can 2% of the population take action?
Africa's 50 percent of the population is under the age of 18.
Eighty percent do not want to be a farmer.
Agriculture is being eliminated.
The lives of small-scale farmers are miserable.
Young people are moving into the city.
In India, farmers are not guaranteed even the smallest infrastructure, and the suicide rate among farmers has been higher than at any time in the past decade.
It's an uncomfortable truth to keep in your mouth.
Where are people going?
It's a city.
There are no young people in the farm.
How do we create a platform that moves young people?
This is a new tractor.
This is my harvesting machine.
A few years ago, I was working at Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and started making things.
They made stupid things, made plants dance, connected to my computer and killed them all.
So I had the closest relationship in my life with plants because I was learning their language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
"Here is an old electronics room that nobody wants.
Try to make the most of it".
My team and I built a farm in it, in a place with little to do with biology.
Not so much, but it produced a volume that could accommodate 300 people each month for a single meal.
What's the most interesting part?
Beautiful, freshly-white roots  greenish-green spines and a harvesting period of only one month.
Is this the new restaurant?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new supermarket?
One thing is certain: Media Lab people are the first to take something out of the way.
I only ate a salad in a bag of sausages, so it's not that strange.
If you're rooting with video-based processing professionals, data scientists and robotics technicians, you'll think to each other, "Well, maybe I can contribute to this field.
No, I want to try". Meanwhile, we took some of the plants back to the lab because what you grew is valuable and cannot be thrown away.
I have a delicate sense of smell because I like my plants to taste.
Because we eat peas first every day, as others do, we can now adjust the pH of peas to within the range of 0.1 by just tasting them.
"This is a pH of 6.1 I can't eat today".
The sausage was very sweet.
Because this plant underwent a chemical reaction to protect itself from stress. "I'm not going to die!"
The resistance of plants to live is sweet to me.
Instead of relying on the latest technology, we have returned to plant physiology.
We felt that others should be able to try this.
I wanted to see an infinite imagination, so I devised a laboratory that could ship anywhere.
The entire surface of this media lab is my lab.The plant utilizes 30 sensors per discarded plant.
If you know the genome or genetics, this is the phenomenon, right?
It's a single phenomenon.
If we claim "Mexican strawberries are good", it would be more accurate to say that strawberries grown in the climate are good.
If you can code the climate, this amount of CO2 and O2 is the perfect recipe for the nutrition and climate, size and shape, and color and texture of the plant you want to grow.
To do this, we need data that can analyze what is happening and therefore we have installed a large number of sensors.
Look at your spike. "Why are you dying? why can't you talk!"
The farmer will have the eyes of the most beautiful prophet.
In their 60s and 70s, they're looking at the dying plants and seeing whether they're deficient in nitrogen or calcium.
You can see that more moisture is needed.
That wisdom is not passed on from generation to generation.
This is the new eye of the cloud environment.
We look for trends in data collected over time and find associations with individual plants.
These figures are the IP addresses of all broccoli who have been offered on Buffet Day.
Now it's time for Broccoli to have an IP address.
If you're ready to be surprised, click here to see the profile of the plant.
The tree shows the growth rate of the plant, but not just when it matures.
Did I achieve the desired nutritional conditions?
When will you get the taste you want?
I wonder if the product is getting too much.
I'm wondering if I'm getting too much sunlight.
All this is a warning sign. plants walk and talk to me.
We had our own language.
Could it be that the plant is the first user of Facebook?
That plant will be friendly with plants that require less nitrogen and potassium but more protein.
Now you will learn about the complex connections that are beyond speculation, and the results will vary depending on how we do it.
This is the current look of my lab.
I know a little about controlled environments thanks to my career in designing medical data centers.
So we are experimenting with a variety of experiments in this environment.
This measuring instrument was developed by NASA to reduce the amount of water sent to Mir space station.
Through this process, plants can provide the resources they need to the ecosystem: water, mineral resources, and oxygen.
Rooting is not so difficult, and if you satisfy it, you will get a beautiful reaction.
It's like having two hearts.
That's why it grows four to five times faster.
It's the perfect environment.
We have been developing seeds to overcome unfavorable environments for a long time, and will continue to do so, but we have a new weapon, the spotless environment, which is a plant we have tried.
It's a tomato that hasn't been grown commercially in 150 years.
Do you know of a seed bank that stores seeds?
The seed bank.
It's a wonderful place.
It is home to a wide variety of biological resources and many of the species that have never been eaten.
I'm probably the only person in this room who's ever eaten such a tomato.
The problem is that this tomato is a sauce and we can't cook it.
We have also grown a wide variety of things through protein mutations.
I raised some people, but not really.
During the experiment, we realized that the device was too large and expensive.
It cost about $10 million a unit to install in various parts of the world.
Not many people can spend $10 million at any given time, so I decided to make it smaller.
In fact, this project is for my undergraduate student Camille, who is majoring in mechanical engineering, so Camille and my team spent the summer thinking about how to make cheaper, more efficient products easier.
And this machine was installed in the 7th-11th grade semester of several schools.
To cultivate humility, teach your children.
Once, he urged the students concerned: "Set the humidity to 65%".
A seventh-grader asked again, "What's the humidity?"
"Cold is the water in the air".
"Could there be water during the summer, you messed up, sir?"
So I advised, "Well, don't trust me".
Can you trust me again?
Try to adjust the humidity to 100.
What happens when a child changes the settings?
The gas is compressed, the water vapor is suspended, and the water drops at the end.
The child says, "Oh, the humidity is so loud".
"Why didn't you tell me that?"
The interface we've created is similar to an online game.
Users can access the 3D environment from anywhere in the world, including smartphones and tablets.
The user adjusts the physical environment and sensors of this machine garden.
You can choose the breeding method that other children around the world have created.
And activates the planting process and sows the seeds.
The seeds may also cause changes during growth.
"Why do you need this carbon dioxide, killing people, when it's not bad for your body?"
They can also increase carbon dioxide levels and kill plants.
Lowering the amount of water can also help the plant grow well.
Once the plant is planted, a new digital breeding method is completed.
This process is a continuum of development and exploration, and users are able to use what they have produced.
Digital breeding methods and data can be downloaded, and compared to previously improved breeding methods. All this is just the beginning. We are going to learn a lot.
This is the 'food computer' of each school, which has three weeks of school time.
It's the way I've grown up over the years.
But more importantly, this was the first time I had given this child the idea, 'I can be a farmer too' or 'I want to be a farmer.'
We have made all of this open source.
All content is available on the web, so make sure you create one at a time.
It won't be easy.
We're just getting started, too, but we're not doing anything.
It is very important to me that anyone can participate more easily because it is a very important thing for me.
It will make it easier.
The farmers are: electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, environmental engineers, computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, urban designers.
They do what they do best for each other on one platform.
Then she got too fat.
This is the facility I just started.
It can be installed anywhere in the world.
That's why I chose this method.
In this warehouse we will make something like this.
These things already exist.
These too already exist.
The first is planting plants.
The second facility is developing an Ebola vaccine.
The winning design of the Darko Grand Challenge and the plants you just saw are one of the reasons why humanity is ahead of the Ebola virus.
These plants are producing proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
Pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical products and peas.
As if the two were completely different, in my field of expertise, I'm a bit of a bit of a jerk.
Everything is different.
The industry is at a point where it's like, "Is this okay?" and "Does it matter?" and there are small squabbles that take place and boast about each other's products.
Buy what's mine instead of that".
But the reality is that we've only just begun.
In the past, food was cheap and abundant.
Now we need good, green food, and even the world's most mysterious food to be number one, it wouldn't be strange.
McDonald's Chicken MacNuggets has entered an era of advertising what makes a McGregor.
In the future, we will be looking at the future.
Personal food computers that operate as food servers and food data centers open phenom.
Like Wikipedia, can anyone add a climate-specific breeding law and how will it be implemented in society?
Do you remember this chart I showed you earlier?
Next time, instead of a line, there will be a dot.
It is not the delivery of food itself.
I'm not going to send food information.
This is already the direction that humanity is heading.
A planned food data center will connect people, given the flaws of the current system.
Blaming each other is not the future of food.
We already know what went wrong.
The future of food supply is to connect the next generation of farmers to a platform to empower and ask each other questions like, "What if?"
Thank you.
Sometimes I am really ashamed as a European.
Last year, millions of people in need of our help arrived in Europe, and our response was frankly disastrous.
There are a lot of contradictions.
We mourn the tragic death of two-year-old Allanko Curdy, but even after that, more than 200 children continued to drown in the Mediterranean.
We have an international treaty that recognizes refugees as a shared responsibility, yet we have accepted that the small Lebanon will accept more Syrians than any other European country.
We mourn the existence of human traffickers, but we are making it the only way to escape to Europe.
We are suffering from a shortage of labour, but we are blocking people from coming to Europe who are in need of economic and population support.
We are defending the values of freedom against Islamic fundamentalism, but we have a policy of coercion: detaining children seeking asylum, leaving children with their families, and plundering the property of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did this happen, and why do we face such an inhuman humanitarian crisis?
I don't think people are not interested, or at least I don't want to believe that.
I think it's because our politicians lack a vision of how to change the international refugee system, created almost 50 years ago, and how to apply it to an internationalised world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very basic questions, a question that we all need to answer.
First, why is the current system not working?
Second, what can we do to correct this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of World War II by these very people.
The basic goal of this is to ensure that when a country fails or, in severe cases, turns its back on its own people, people have a safe place to go and live in dignity until they can go home.
It was created for a situation like Syria today.
Under international agreements signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the International Organization for Refugees, the UN refugee agency, have agreed to mutually accept people who have been displaced by physical conflict and abuse into their own territory.
But today that system has failed.
In theory, a refugee has the right to seek asylum.
In fact, our immigration policy is blocking the road to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to be accepted or to return to their country of origin.
But in reality, they are trapped in an endless uncertainty.
Theoretically, refugees are the global responsibility.
In fact, according to population statistics, the countries bordering the conflict zone are hosting the vast majority of the world's refugees.
This system is not broken by a set of rules.
Because we have not applied it properly to a changing world, and this is exactly what we need to consider.
So let me briefly explain how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
I will not speak from an institutional point of view, but from the perspective of refugees.
Let's think of a Syrian woman.
I'm going to call her Amira.
For me, Ameera represents many people I met in that area.
Amira, like about 25% of the world's refugees, is a woman with children and she cannot go home because she came from this very city.
So, Amira can not go back.
But Amira also has no desire to relocate to a third country, as it is a lottery permitted to less than 1% of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is to take the family to the camp.
He may get help from the camp, but there is little hope for Amira and her family.
The camp is located in an almost deserted area, deserted and dry.
In the Joritani refugee camp in Jatirai, you can hear gunshots coming from across the Syrian border in the middle of the night.
Economic activity is also limited,
The quality of education is also low.
And around 80% of refugees living in camps worldwide must stay there for at least five years.
Such a miserable life, in fact, is probably why only 9% of Syrians choose the camps.
Instead, Amira may head to urban areas in neighboring countries such as Amman and Beirut.
This is the method that 75% of Syrian refugees have already chosen.
But there are also enormous difficulties.
Refugees usually do not have the right to work in such urban areas.
There is no special way to get help.
So Amira and her family are forced to spend all the money left over and face a life of poverty or little.
So there is a third alternative, which many Syrians have recently chosen.
Amira is willing to risk her life on a very dangerous and risky journey to another country for her family, a phenomenon we see in Europe today.
The whole world is plunged into three choices that are almost impossible for refugees: camp life, urban poverty, and dangerous travel.
For refugees, that choice is today the global refugee rescue plan.
But I think this is the wrong choice.
I think we should reconsider this choice.
We restrict the choice because we think it is the only way for refugees to choose, which is not the case.
Politicians are describing this as a zero-sum issue, meaning that if the refugees are given benefits, the citizens will be charged costs.
We seem to view refugees as an inevitable cost, or a burden, to society.
But they don't. They can contribute too.
So what I want to argue is that there is a way to expand the choice of refugees and benefit everyone - both the refugee camp and the organizations, our society and the refugees.
And what I would like to suggest is four ways to change the paradigm of dealing with refugees.
All four approaches have one thing in common: globalization and mobility, taking advantage of market opportunities, and changing our thinking about refugee issues.
The first thing we want to think about is the part of the environment that is provided, and this starts with the basic understanding that refugees are also people like us, just people in a special environment.
I worked with a colleague at Oxford to conduct a research project on the economic life of refugees in Uganda.
The reason we chose Uganda was not because we represented the host country.
Ugandan is a very exceptional species.
Unlike most host countries in the world, Uganda has provided economic opportunities for refugees.
It gave him the right to work and freedom of movement.
And the result was enormous for refugees and society alike.
In the capital, Kampala, we saw that 21% of refugees were engaged in business while employing others, and 40% of the respondents were Ugandans.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
In the camps, we also found exceptional cases of thriving and thriving entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, I have also seen the case of Congolese refugees who run a digital music business in their residence called Nakikobail.
Also, one Rwandan refugee was running a business where children could play computer games using recycled TVs and game consoles.
The refugees were fighting for innovation in the face of extreme restrictions.
Despite coming to the residence with almost empty hands, Deko Deko-kei wanted to become a filmmaker.
So I started a local radio station with friends, colleagues, and now I'm making a movie with a video camera.
He made two documentaries for our team, and built a successful business with almost nothing.
This is an example that could change our reaction to refugees.
Refugees should not be seen as simply dependent on humanitarian aid, but should be given the opportunity to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothing, clothing, shelter, and food are all very important in an emergency situation, but we need to look beyond that.
We must provide them with opportunities in direct connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, capital and finance.
Everything we take for granted in the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second thing I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all host countries around the world are taking the same steps as Uganda.
The vast majority of host countries are not opening up their economies to refugees.
But there are still practical alternatives we can choose from.
Last April, I visited Jordan with a colleague and developed an idea while there with the development economist Paul Corriller, working with the international community and government to support Jordan's national development strategy to provide jobs to Syrians.
The idea is to potentially integrate refugee employment with employment in Jordan, the host country, as it relates to the economic zone.
The 83,000 refugees' refugees' shelter, located just 15 minutes from the Jatirai refugee camp, is an existing economic zone called the King Hussain bin Talal Development Zone.
The government spent more than $100 million to build electricity and road networks, but two things were missing: access to work and internal investment.
What if the refugees could work there, rather than being trapped in a camp, to support their families and to gain skills through vocational training, until they return to Syria?
That would be beneficial to Jordan because Jordan's development strategy requires a leap to middle-class countries through manufacturing.
This can not only benefit refugees, but also contribute to the post-conflict recovery of Syria, through the recognition that we should embrace refugees as the best resource for reconstruction in Syria.
We published this idea in the journal Foreign Affairs,
King Abdullah adopted our idea.
It was announced two weeks ago at the London Syria Conference and the pilot is scheduled to take place this summer.
The third idea I would like to propose to you is to match preferences between countries and refugees to lead to happy results, like the photo of Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees here.
We hardly ask refugees what we want or where we want to go, but I want to ask this question and argue that it can benefit everyone.
Economist Alvin Ross developed the idea of a matching market, where the preference ranking of the parties ultimately makes the match.
My colleagues, Will Jones and Alex Tittelboim, investigated whether the idea could be applied to refugees, ranking refugees' preferred destinations, and matching them to countries based on technology or language.
Of course, there may be some tolerance for diversity or vulnerability here, but it is still a way to increase matching probability.
The matching idea is used in many places, for example, to match the student and university area, or to match a kidney transplant with a patient, and is also applied to the dating website's algorithm.
Why not apply this to the critical choice of refugees?
It is applicable to the national level, of course, and to convincing the local community to accept refugees, the great challenge we face.
And at that moment, for example, in our country, we often send engineers and farmers to rural and urban areas - which is ridiculous.
Market matching is therefore both a way to ask for preferences, and a potential way for the host country to meet the needs and demands of refugees.
The fourth ideal I would like to tell you about is the humanitarian visa.
The vast majority of the tragedies and chaos that can be seen in Europe can be largely prevented.
This is due to the fundamental contradiction of European asylum policy, which is to say, that to go to Europe, you must voluntarily embark on the very dangerous journey mentioned above.
But why such a trip, in this age of aviation and modern consularism.
It is a truly unnecessary journey, and last year more than 3,000 people lost their lives on the European border and on European territory.
If refugees could travel directly to Europe and find asylum, we could have avoided, and we could have done something through the so-called humanitarian visa, which allows people to get visas at embassies or consulates in neighboring countries and buy a boat or plane ticket to travel to Europe.
To travel from Turkey to the Greek island via a smuggler, you have to pay 1,000 euros.
From the boardroom to Frankfurt, it costs 200 euros.
Allowing refugees to do so would be a clear advantage.
It could save lives, limit the market for smugglers, and remove the chaos seen in Europe's front lines, such as the Greek islands.
What prevents us from doing so is politics, not rational solutions.
And here's an idea that's been applied.
Brazil has taken a pioneering approach, issuing humanitarian visas to 2,000 Syrians, allowing entry into Brazil and granting them refugee status.
Thanks to this system, all Syrians were granted refugee status and recognized as refugees.
There is also a historical precedent for this.
Between 1922 and 1942, the Nansen passport was used for travel, and 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, Chechens were allowed to travel to Europe and were granted refugee status anywhere in Europe.
And the International Organization for Refugees (IORF) of Nanzen was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its effective strategy.
So the four ideas I mentioned are how we can increase Amira's selection.
It is a way to give refugees more choice, and to benefit everyone, as I have already said, beyond three very basic, almost impossible choices.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision - one that can increase the choice of refugees, one that doesn't need to be seen as a burden.
If you look at the cost of refugee support, anything is possible.
Of course, they are human responsibilities, but they are people with the skills, talents, inspiration, the ability to contribute, of course, if we help them do so.
Moving to the new world is not going away forever.
What we have seen in Europe will not last long.
People will continue to travel and find new settlements, and we must find a rational and realistic way to do this, not based on the old theory of humanitarian aid, not based on the theory of charity, but on creating opportunities, globalisation and markets, mobility.
I would like to urge all of you and politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I dreamed of the ocean.
The ocean was a world of wildlife rich in color and life and home to fantastic creatures of strange appearance.
I photographed the great sharks that dominate the food chain and saw beautiful sea turtles dancing across the coral reef.
I became a marine biologist and photographer, and spent most of my professional life searching for the fantastic place I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I have experienced the world of water since I was quite young.
When I first went to the deep sea, I was only ten years old.
I still vividly remember working hard to reach the old, stiff cannon on the coral reef.
Finally, as I was holding the gun in my hand, I looked up and noticed that it was surrounded by rainbow-colored fish.
That day I fell in love with the sea.
[Thomas Fko] [Environmental photographer] Having lived on this planet for 40 years, I have had the great privilege of working for the National Geographic Monthly and the Save Our Seas Foundation, exploring the most beautiful sea scenery.
I have photographed numerous creatures, from very, very large sharks to large, hand-to-hand sharks.
I smelled the smell of a black whale's furry underwear eating in front of me in the cold sea in front of the Great Bear Rainforest in Canada.
We also witnessed the mating ceremony of blue sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Everyone on earth is affected by the ocean, and it is affected.
And the sea of nature, as we had dreamed of it before, is becoming increasingly difficult to find.
They are under increasing pressure and are under threat.
I witnessed and photographed the effects of human activity on nature, taking the place of the world's leading predators.
For quite some time, I thought that to wake the audience up from the indifference, I had to show a shocking picture.
Although this approach has its advantages, it has returned to its point.
Because the best way to lead change is to express love.
Perhaps as a kind of dealer and photographer, I have a rare opportunity to uncover the animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the surface of the sea.
If you don't even know that something exists, you can't love and defend anything.
The power of environmental photography is to reveal the beauty of nature.
I have visited hundreds of ocean locations, but few have impressed me deeply.
The first time I was so enthralled was about 10 years ago on the rocky coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, huge rainy seasons are observed, and a group called the rainy runners move northward.
These fish have a good reason to flee.
They are feeding on a herd of hungry and voracious predators.
They hunt together, separating some of the population from the main group and forming a trap bunch.
Dolphins lured fish to the surface of the sea, then squatted and grazed moving reptiles.
From behind, the shark is chasing.
Many people think that sharks and dolphins are the ancestors of the Bulldog, but they coexist in the race.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to prey more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the trap mass will become even more scattered, and sharks will fill their stomachs with what I often call a purple donut.
I've had a few dangerous moments with sharks in the race, but the sharks don't see me as a predator.
But in this noisy show, I hit or fall in the tail like any of the other contestants.
Off the coast of Africa, we cross the vast Indian Ocean eastward to the island of Maldives, an archipelago made up of the Sancho Islands.
And during the stormy southwestern corner, the rat-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go-go
A herd of reptiles not larger than their eyebrows is their main prey.
When the density of plankton decreases, they feed on their own, and like dogs that bite their tails, they continue to help with the air pollution.
But as the density of plankton increases, the rats form such a long food chain, and the prey that escapes the first or second rat is likely to be fed to the next rat.
When the number of plankton in the bay reaches a peak, the rat-eagles observe the unusual behavior we call the whirlwinds and swim close by.
And while swimming in dense sizes, the rats themselves make a whirlwind and suck the plankton with their mouths.
This experience of swimming surrounded by a herd of ratholes is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hannipalu, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
Working with NGOs such as the Mankota Foundation, my photographs ultimately helped transform Hannipalu into a marine protected area.
Fishermen from neighboring islands who hunted rat whales to make traditional shells of the northern pike.
They are now the most ardent environmental activists, and the Maldivian economy receives more than $8 million annually from the Rugaoli.
I always wanted to travel back in time to a time when the map was mostly empty or when it said "it's worth living".
And the closest I have ever had to this experience was in the remote coral reefs of western Indian Ocean.
Diving away from ocean routes and fishing trails reminds me of what our oceans once looked like.
Few people have heard of Vasco da India, a small coral island in the Mozambique Channel.
Corals form an outer barrier for protection, and the inner protectorate is the nesting habitat of Galapagos sharks.
These sharks never get embarrassed, even during the day.
I guess I guessed that at night sharks would be more daring.
I have never seen so many sharks gathered in one reef.
Recalling and sharing such moments reminds me why I chose this path.
Earlier this year, I went to Baja California for a National Geographic magazine assignment.
And about halfway down the Pacific Ocean is San Ignacio Lajo, an important breeding ground for the ghost whale.
For hundreds of years, this coast was the site of a mass slaughter of more than 20,000 ghost whales, and only a few hundred remained.
The descendants of the whales that survive today push their young to the surface of the sea to play with us and even to communicate with us.
This species has made a truly amazing comeback.
On the other side of the peninsula is the small fishing village of Cabo Pulmo.
Decades of planning led the town to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced the authorities to designate their coastline as a marine protected area.
But what has happened since then has come close to miraculous.
After only 10 years of protection in 2005, scientists have witnessed the recovery of the largest fish in history.
But don't believe me, and go with me.
Let's swim together in the largest and densest fish pack I've ever encountered.
All of us can become creators of hope.
And I want to teach my photography a lesson that there is still hope in our oceans.
I would like to draw particular attention to the resilience of nature facing 7.3 billion people.
I hope that in the future it will be very difficult to take pictures like this, but I would like to take pictures that show that we respect and coexist with each other and with the sea.
I hope it's common to take such pictures.
To survive and thrive as a marine photographer, you must be a great optimist.
I always work with the belief that the next great photo will bring about change, whether it's in the next encounter, behind the next encounter, or in the next encounter.
When I arrived in Harare, Zimbabwe in 1985, the government had put social justice at the heart of national health policy.
After a long war of independence, a new government came into being and the new government immediately adopted a socialist policy: healthcare, basic education, and free education.
With the number of health centers in the provinces exploding, 80% of the population has achieved a remarkable result of being within 2 hours of a health center.
In 1980, shortly after independence, only 25% of children were vaccinated.
Ten years later, in 1990, that number had risen to 80 percent.
I was incredibly proud to be a part of this change and revolution.
I felt a strong excitement and sympathy for people.
Working with the great scientists, doctors, and activists of Zimbabwe, I felt I was on the scene of the African independence movement and, more importantly, of the global welfare movement.
In 1985, the year I first arrived,
The first case of AIDS infection was reported in Zimbabwe.
While I was receiving medical treatment, I took care of a few AIDS patients, but it was hard to expect equal medical resources in Africa.
Initially, the infection rate was about 2 percent, a figure that was still high when I left Harare 17 years later.
One of the four men rose to the top.
In the mid-1990s, I was able to promote HIV to hundreds of people at their peak.
I have seen colleagues, friends, students, and patients die.
In response, my colleagues and I opened a clinic.
We taught them how to use condoms.
I have also been educated at school and at work.
The companions of those infected were advised on how to protect themselves from the disease.
He worked hard and at the time believed he was doing his best.
As a doctor, I treated patients well, but I never claimed that structural changes were needed.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been frank about his mistake in calling for the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was the UN's Director of Peace Keeping Activities.
In his speech on the 10th anniversary of the Holocaust, he recalled: "I believed I was doing my best at the time, but when I looked back after the Holocaust, I realized that there were more things I could or should have done, and I could have informed and helped.
Now that AIDS has devastated the healthcare system and claimed the lives of an estimated 39 million people, I too feel sad and regret for things I did not do sooner.
Until I arrived in Zimbabwe, I did not see my role as a political supporter or political participation.
I was there as an expert in medical and epidemiological related technologies.
My goal was to care for patients and to better understand the path of disease through research to slow the spread of disease.
I learned that the marginalized sections of society were vulnerable to the threat of AIDS.
In Sugar Farm, which is more closed than any other business in the modern world, 60% of pregnant women have been diagnosed with AIDS.
I have tried to make it known that the fact that I have AIDS is not a moral decay, but that it is a result of male-dominated culture and forced migrant labour, colonization.
White people had a low rate of infection.
As health professionals, the tools we were given were very rare, such as lifestyle changes, condom use, and the recommendation to cut down on same-sex partners.
The infection rate continued to rise, and the most promising treatment, developed in the West, but at a cost of scarcity, was distributed to Africa.
I did not speak out on the issues of inequality of access to treatment, the economic and political system, and I thought I could justify my silence by saying that I was just a guest in this country, that if I were to be warned, I would be deported and that I would no longer be able to care for patients or carry out the necessary research.
So I adapted to the government's initial response to AIDS.
I didn't speak out loud enough about my concerns.
Many doctors, health professionals, and others will think I am not at fault.
The contract with the patient, the Hippocratic Oath, etc., signifies the sanctity of the patient-doctor relationship.
And I provided every patient with everything I could.
But I knew that disease arises from the rifts in our society, and that not only biology but also social imbalance, exclusion and discrimination of race, gender, class, and other kinds have a greater impact.
That's what Aids did.
The same was true of the recent Ebola outbreak.
Paul Farmer, a medical anthropologist who studied AIDS in Haiti, calls this "structured violence".The reason structure is problematic is that there is inequality inherent in the political and economic structures of our society that are not aware of the right to vote.
If we are not aware of this social injustice, the patient's treatment is only impartial.
Warning of this in advance is the first step towards the right to public health and a way to solve problems together and make real change.
Even if the listener is uncomfortable,
Even if I feel uncomfortable, I say a lot of things, most of which are interracial polarization or racism.
These are things that should no longer be in this country, especially in the pharmaceutical, public health, and healthcare sectors.
But these are virgins, and we don't care much.
That is why it is the job of the New York State Department of Health to warn against the health effects of racism in the United States, the organizations that people of color face every day, the violence by individuals that will lead to 250 years of slavery and 90 years of racism, and 60 years of imperfect equality, all of which have resulted in the sad history of the United States.
Blacks are 50 percent more likely to be black than whites.
In 2012, black women had a more than 10 times higher risk of dying during childbirth than white women.
And despite a dramatic decline in infant mortality, black babies are still nearly three times more likely to die in their first year than white babies.
These statistical results were similar to those obtained from across the United States.
Recently, The New York Times reported that 1.5 million black men across the country were missing from their analysis, and that they should be between the ages of 25 and 54.
One in six black men is imprisoned or prematurely murdered, and young black men are facing daily inequality and one-sided violence.
The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, a recent social movement, is well represented, but we also recognize their hardship and suffering.
It is important to remember that the numerous risk factors and the outbreaks and consequences of major diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AIDS, can lead to early death if their lives are slowly dormant and aggravated.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement spread, I was disappointed and angry that the medical community was not even using the word "racism" in research or at work.
Because my feelings will be conveyed to you too.
Although medical students often wear white, they protest, but the medical community generally remains silent about the impact of social discrimination on the spread of disease and mortality.
And I have to say about modern medicine, which is geared toward personalized, refined medicine that develops biological or genetic treatments, that these movements are the side effects of the daily routine we live, grow, work, love, and that so many people are disadvantaged.
Every time we go to the clinic or do research as a healthcare professional working in everyday life, we realize a huge amount of injustice: whether it's a homeless person who doesn't follow a prescription and is more likely to survive than his own illness, a transgender young person who can't stand the discrimination in our society and is considering suicide, or whether it's his responsibility to take care of his children's illness.
Our role as health professionals is not only to treat patients, but also to warn them beforehand and call for change.
Whether rightly or wrongly, our social standing gives our words strength, and we should not waste this power.
Regreting Zimbabwe's actions, I, as New York's Health Secretary, have vowed to be willing to warn in advance and not to spare any available means of promoting health equity.
I want your help, and I will help you when you speak out about sexism or other discrimination.
It is time to speak up together about structural inequality and how to change it.
It is not wise to follow all the circumstances, but to have courage.
The health of our patients, and indeed of all of us, depends on this.
Listen to the hands of those who have ever blocked someone who has said something unpleasant about politics, religion, parenting, food on Facebook.
Or do you have at least one person you want to avoid?
In the old days, to have a decent conversation, it was necessary to follow Henry Higgins's words in My Fair Lady: "Talk only about the weather and health".
But these days, because of topics like climate change and the vaccine denial movement, such topics are also dangerous.
The world we live in is one where all conversations can possibly turn into arguments, and politicians can't talk to each other, and even the smallest issues are one where someone enthusiastically discusses pro- and pro- is unusual.
A study of millions of adult Americans at the Fukuoka Institute found that we are now the most polarized and divided people in history.
It's also less likely to compromise, because the other person won't listen.
Where we live, who we marry, and even who we befriend are all determined by what we already believe.
It means not to be discouraged by others.
Talking and listening must be balanced, but one day we lost that balance.
To some extent, it is also the fault of technological advancement.
We live next door to our homes, always with a smartphone or a home at any time.
According to the Ko Fu Institute, one in three American teens sends more than 100 letters a day.
And the vast majority of teens say they spend more time talking in writing than they do in front of their friends and talking to them.
A funny article appeared in the monthly Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Vanwell.
Mr. Bankowell asked his students about a topic.
I was given the task of speaking in the moment without having to write a note.
And then Mr. Bankowell said,
"I have come to realize that the art of conversation is the most underrated and unlearned art".
Children communicate on screen for several hours a day, but they have little opportunity to hone their skills in interpersonal communication.
It may seem a strange question, but let's ask ourselves: Is there any more important skill than logical and confident communication among the skills needed in the 21st century?
I am talking to people by profession: Nobel laureate, truck driver billionaire, kindergarten teacher national figurehead, plumber...
I talk to people I like and people I hate.
I also talk to people who personally don't agree with me very much.
But we still have a good conversation.
So I'm going to show you how to talk and listen in the next 10 minutes.
Many of you have probably heard some advice on this, such as looking into your eyes and talking, thinking ahead of time about an interesting topic, nodding your head, laughing and focusing, or following up on what you just heard or summarizing it.
Forget all these tips and tricks.
Because it sounds like shit.
If you're really focused and listening, you don't need to learn how to tell people you're listening.
I sometimes have a conversation with them.
Use the technique when conducting professional interviews, so I'll be nurturing your conversational skills.
I will teach you the techniques of interviewing people who are not bored, who are not bored, who are not distracted, who are not disturbed by the feelings of others.
Learn how to have a conversation.
We've all had good conversations, and I know what a good conversation is like because I've done it before.
A conversation that feels really good or feels perfectly understood.
I'll give you 10 basic rules, all of which I'll detail, if you can get one of them.
You can enjoy a much better conversation.
First, do not do many things at once, such as a cell phone, tablet, car key, or anything else in your hand.
It's not just about putting it down.
Be faithful to the moment.
Focus on the focus.
A previous quarrel with my boss, this evening's menu.
If you want to end a conversation, don't focus too much, but just stay out of it.
Second, do not preach.
If you want to express your opinion and don't like reactions, arguments, objections, or growth, write on the blog.
The reason I don't take poetry reviews on my show is because people are boring.
If you're a conservative, you'll hate Obamacare, welfare, abortion and the like.
If he is progressive, he will hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
It's totally obvious.
You must not do this.
Enter the conversation with the attitude that there is always something to learn.
Renowned psychotherapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening will bring you down.
This means that there are times when you have to give up your personal opinion.
According to him, if the speaker feels that the listener is accepting, he will become weaker and more open-minded.
Again, but always think there is something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Everyone you meet knows something you don't know".
In my own words, everyone is an expert in a particular field.
Third, ask questions that you can freely answer.
Learn this from the way journalists use it.
Start the question with the basic rule.
Asking complex questions gives you simple answers.
If I asked, "Why were you afraid?"
You will respond to the most powerful word in that question, "fear", and you will answer "yes" or "no".
"Did you change?" "Yes, I was very angry".
Ask the respondent to describe himself, knowing how he feels.
Questions like "How were you?" or "How did you feel?"
Ask yourself.
The answering party will have to think for a moment and give a more interesting answer.
Fourth, follow the flow of conversation.
If any thought comes to mind, it means that you must erase it from your mind.
In one interview, a guest talks for a few minutes and then the social worker suddenly asks a question that he or she has already answered.
It means that a social worker has a very smart question that comes to mind and has been waiting for the timing to ask the question for two minutes and not listen to it anymore.
We are doing the same thing.
While sitting down and talking to someone, suddenly remember meeting Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop the other day.
Then we stop listening.
I'll think of a theme or an idea.
But I still have to let it go.
Fifth, if you don't know, say you don't know.
People on radio, especially on public television, these days, are careful not to say, 'I know for sure, I am an expert in this field,' because they know that what they say is recorded.
Be too careful with yourself.
Conversations should not be intimidating.
Sixth, do not compare your experience with the experience of others.
If someone talks about the death of a family, don't talk about when you lost your family.
If someone says the company is hard to do, don't complain about your work.
It's never the same.
Because every experience is different.
Most importantly, you are not the center.
You don't have to take advantage of that moment to brag or brag.
When someone asked Stephen Hawking how much his IQ was, he said, "I don't know, the guy with the IQ is a dick".
Conversation is not an opportunity to brag.
Seven, don't repeat what you said, it seems like a good check and really boring, but we often do.
If you have something to say, especially at work or when talking to your child, you will often repeat the same words.
Don't try to do that.
Eighth, don't get caught up in the details.
To be honest, the listener is not interested in the exact dates, names, dates, or dates you are trying to remember.
You care about who you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details, you don't have to say it.
The ninth, but not the last, but the most important.
Listen to me.
Countless great people have said that listening is perhaps the most important skill you can develop.Buddha said, "If you open your mouth, you are not learning".
President Calvin Coolidge said, "No one has been fired for listening too much".
Why should we not listen?
First, because we want to talk.
When I speak, I control the conversation.
I can't hear you say I'm not interested.
I'm getting attention because I'm being cared for.
It can strengthen my identity.
But there is another reason: we are distracted.
A person speaks an average of 225 words per minute, but can hear up to 500 words per minute.
So in my head, I'm filling out the remaining 275 words.
I know, it takes a lot of effort and energy to focus on someone else, but if you don't, you're not talking to them.
Two people throwing unrelated phrases in the same time slot.
We should listen to each other.
Stephen Curby said,
"We listen to understand, not to answer".
And for the tenth time, be brief.
'A good conversation is a mini-scout. Short enough to keep the interest and long enough to cover the subject.' - My brother, after all, the basic principle of all this is one thing: be interested in the other.
I grew up under a famous grandfather and there was a kind of ritual in the house.
When someone came to talk to my grandparents, my mother told me when she asked me if I knew who he was.
"I'm the Miss America line.
I'm the mayor of Sacramento.
This is the winner of the Lichers Prize, this is the Russian Ballerina".
So I grew up thinking that there is something amazing hidden from everyone.
I think that thought made him a good socialite.
Do not open your mouth as much as possible, open your mind, always ready to surprise and never disappoint.
Do the same to yourself.
Get out there and talk to people and listen, and above all, be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you.
Hello, you are here.
My name is Matthew Williamsko, and I'm the champion.
I have won medals in three sports at the Canadian National Championships, competed in international basketball competitions, and was proud to represent Canada on the world stage.
I train five days a week in basketball and speed skating, working with the best coaches and psychiatrists to be the best in my field.
All of this is made possible through the Special Olympics.
Did this change your mind about me and my achievements?
The world doesn't see all of my kind as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were being disguised and had to be hidden.
Although there have been many changes since the Special Olympics began in 1968, for the most part, people with intellectual disabilities are seen by many as being transparent.
People know that using the word 'fuck' in front of me has nothing to do with it.
The word is used as a derogatory and derogatory term for "sick" or "sick like a sick person".
They don't think about how much this word hurts me and my friends.
I hope you don't think I'm here for charity.
I'm here because many people still have a big problem with seeing people with intellectual disabilities, or if too many, don't even recognize them.
Did you know that this year there was a World Cup?
I was one of more than 6,500 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 165 countries who gathered in Los Angeles for the Special Olympics.
More than 62,000 people watched the opening ceremony, and there was live media on TSN and ESPN.
Did you know that this has ever happened?
What do you think of a person like me?
I hope that as you and I sit here today, you will see us as equals.
Special Olympics are designed to change the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It also changes the perspective of everyone watching.
Special Olympics is a competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
We will change the quality of life and the views of people with intellectual disabilities for athletes.
This movement has changed not only my life but the lives of many others as well.
The way I look at it has also changed.
I was born with cerebral palsy and intellectual disabilities.
As a child, I played hockey until I was 12 years old.As I grew older, I found it difficult to keep up with other children's levels, and became unresponsive and angry.
I didn't exercise for a while, didn't have many friends, was lonely and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one knew that they would be active and a valued member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the impact of general exercise on the health status of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through thorough scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that children with intellectual disabilities have a declining health level because they lack the opportunity to participate in physical activity.
Many people have doubted that a number of health programs or fitness clubs will be of great benefit to people with intellectual disabilities.
But Dr. Hayden and Unice Kennedy Schlifer, founder of Special Olympics, did not act as pioneers, and Special Olympics athletes proved themselves right 4.5 million times.
Before joining Special Olympics, I was very anxious because I was young, ambitious, insecure, and had few friends.
But as soon as I got on stage, everyone encouraged and supported me, and it helped me to be myself, no matter what others thought.
I am now a basketball player and speed skater, competing in several local and national competitions, competing until the Summer Olympics in LA this year, and being a member of Canada's first-ever World Cup basketball team.
I am one of the more than 4.5 million athletes in the world, but I have heard a lot of similar stories.
Being a Special Olympics athlete helps restore our pride and self-esteem.
In addition, Special Olympics also address important health needs.
Many studies have shown that on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years earlier than normal men, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years earlier than normal women.
Special Olympics keep us healthy by keeping us moving and engaging in physical activity.
Our coaches also teach you about nutrition and health.
Furthermore, Special Olympics also provide free health checks for athletes who have difficulty communicating with doctors or who have difficulty accessing health insurance.
At the 2015 Summer Olympics, my Canadian colleagues and I played for the Nigerian national basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian team attended a World Games athlete health check-up, and seven out of 10 athletes were given free earphones to hear the sound for the first time in their lives.
The changes that have taken place in them have been enormous.
They were more godly, happy, and self-confident because they could communicate with the director.
The sound of basketball, the sound of hurrying, the cheering of the audience - these sounds are so natural to us.
Special Olympics are not just about changing athletes in one sport.
It's changing their lives outside the stadium.
A recent study found that half of U.S. adults don't know an individual with an intellectual disability, and 44% of Americans who have no personal connection to the disability say they have much less respect for them.
Even the word 'fuck' means that for many people with intellectual disabilities, they are still transparent.
People use this word in light words and in insults.
Last year, the word was mentioned more than 9 million times on Twitter, a huge blow to me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world.
Many people think that these words are not offensive, but they are not.
My colleague and global messenger John Franklin Stevens publicly responded to a political expert who used the word 'fuck' as a derogatory term. "Some day, join us at a special Olympics.
Let's see if you can move forward without changing your mind".
This year, at the 2015 Summer Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the final.
In the end, it was just a pass, and my proud colleague Jackie Barrett deflected 297kg and lifted 277kg from the squat position, the best record in the history of the Special Olympics.
Jacko Jackie is the record holder among all Newfoundland track and field athletes, not only in the Special Olympics, but also in all track and field events.
Jackie was a huge star in LA and ESPN updated his record on Twitter in real time, not to mention admiring his performance.
Fifty years ago, few people thought that people with intellectual disabilities could do such a thing.
This year, the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum filled 60,000 seats to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games, and drew thousands of athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Instead of hiding it, we were encouraged and celebrated.
Special Olympics teach athletes to be confident and proud.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities are a respected part of our society.
I now have dreams in my field, accomplishments, great coaches, respect and self-esteem, and am much healthier.
I am no longer hiding or being mocked, but I am here to give a TED talk.
The world has changed a lot thanks to Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet an intellectual disabled person, please look at his talents.
The next time someone around you uses the word 'fuck' or 'fuck' you should let them know how much that little word hurts.
I hope you will also participate in the Special Olympics.
I will make one last statement.
As Nelson Mandela said, "Sports have the power to change the world".
Special Olympics are changing the world, changing the lives of 4.5 million athletes, giving us a place to stand more confidently, meet friends, not be judged, feel champion, and become champions.
Thank you.
You may not have heard of Kenema or Arua.
But I know these two places as the strangest places on earth.
The hospitals there are a community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have been quietly confronting the greatest mortal threat to mankind for years: the Lhasa virus.
The Lakota virus is very similar to Ebola.
It can cause severe seizures and is extremely fatal.
Yet they are putting their lives at risk every day to protect those here and to protect us all.
But the strangest thing I learned about them when I first visited them a few years ago was that they started their day with a song.
They gather together to share joy.
They show their own toji.
And over the years, when I visit them or when they visit me, we have enjoyed singing and writing together, because we are here to teach that we are only here to pursue science, united by the united humanity that Ana shares.
As you may think, such a process has become very important and even an essential element when something changes.
And in March 2014, when the Ebola outbreak in Guinea was declared, a lot changed.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, and the site of its onset was near the Sierra Leone-Liberia border.
And it was so scary, we were all scared.
In fact, we suspected for some time that Lascaux and Ebola were more widespread than we thought, and would one day be introduced into Kenya.
So members of my research team were immediately dispatched to join Dr. Humar Khan and his team in preparing a detailed molecular diagnosis to help them know if Ebola crosses the border into Sierra Leone.
We have already built such a system for the Lhasa virus and knew how to deal with it this time.
We have only to provide them with tools and places to investigate Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to a hospital with a midwife, and the team performed a critical molecular diagnosis to confirm the first Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.
This was a remarkable achievement.
They were able to diagnose the case immediately, treat the patient safely and start contact tracking investigations to determine how it happened.
Maybe something could have stopped.
But by the time that day came, Ebola had already been breeding for several months.
With hundreds of cases, it has already outpaced diseases that have occurred in the past.
And in Sierra Leone, not one case, I heard like Haile.
We have dealt with a number of cases, in collaboration with the international community and the health and fitness community, in one week 31 cases followed by 92 and 147 cases, all of which came to Kenema, the only place in Sierra Leone where we could deal with them.
And we tried to do everything we could 24 hours a day, helping people and trying to get attention, but we did another simple thing.
From a sample taken from the patient's blood to detect Ebola, of course, the sample can be discarded.
What we could do was just put in the chemical and deactivate it, put it in a box and then drive it across the sea, and we did.
My team sent him to Boston to work.
We continued to work tirelessly every day, and we created 99 Ebola virus genomes.
This was a sketch, a genome sketch of a virus.
We all have them.
It speaks of everything that makes us, and it gives us a wealth of information.
The results of such experiments are very simple and powerful.
We were able to carry and compare these 99 different viruses and to find out, in fact, by comparing three genomes that had previously been discovered in Guinea.
This is very important to know how to intervene, but more importantly, contact tracking.
We found that the virus is being transformed as it spreads among people.
And each mutation was very important, because the various diagnostic methods and vaccines, the treatments we used, were all based on a sequence of genes that basically drive the virus.
So global health professionals had to react to this, develop and re-evaluate everything they were doing.
But from where I was at the time, the way science operates is to collect data, work in isolation for months, and then very carefully and slowly analyze the data, suggesting a paper to be published, then gradually researched, and then finally distributed when the paper was published.
For this is how the present situation works.
But at this point, it won't work, right?
We had friends on the front lines and what we obviously needed was help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was to release the gene sequences to the web as soon as they were detected by the machine.
I went public and said, "Please help me".
And then came the call for help.
Before we knew it, people from all over the world contacted us, surprised by the data that was released.
Some very great virus trackers joined our community at some point.
We worked together in a fantastic way - sharing, regular phone calls, communication, etc. - to track the virus in a moment and try to find a variety of ways to stop it.
There are many ways to create these communities.
Especially as the outbreak of the disease spread worldwide, everyone reached out to learn about the disease, participate, and get involved.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The amount of human capacity that is present here is incredible, and the Internet has connected us all.
Instead of us being afraid of each other, you can say, "Let's do this.
Can you imagine what we can do together to make it happen?"
But the problem was that we all used the data, and that Google on the web had limits on what we were supposed to do.
And if that happens, don't miss out on many opportunities.
At the beginning of the Kinema epidemic, we had 106 patient records and once again disclosed this to the world.
And in our lab, we trained computers to allow you access to 106 records and predict the prognosis of an Ebola patient with 100 degrees of accuracy.
And we also created an app to distribute it, making it available to medical personnel on the ground.
But the number 106 was not strong enough to make it strong enough or to make it recognizable.
So we're waiting for more data to be distributed and we're not going to stop.
Those data are still not coming.
We are still waiting in isolation and improving instead of working together.
And we will not be able to accept this fact.
You won't be able to accept it all.
Because our lives are at stake.
And in fact, many lives were lost, including numerous medical personnel, including my dear colleagues, five colleagues: Embalou Pony, Alex Moigbois, Dr. Humar Khanko, Alice Koboma and Mohamed Fula.
These are five of the many medical personnel who have been hiding in Kenya and beyond, the world waiting for us, all of us working, quietly, separately.
You know, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is exacerbated by distrust, division, and division.
If we build barriers to divide and fight each other, the virus thrives.
But unlike anything that threatens humanity, the place where we are all the same humans is Ebola.
We are all in this together.
The Ebola outbreak in a single household could become ours at some point.
So here with the same vulnerability, the same strength, the same fear, the same hope, I hope we can work together with joy.
One of my graduate students, Keneko, was reading a book about Sierra Leone and discovered that the word "Kenema", the hospital where we worked and the city where we worked in Sierra Leone, comes from a Mende word meaning "clean as a river, transparent and open to the public".
It surprised us all because we always felt that before we knew it, we had to work openly, share, and work together to respect the Kenema people we worked with.
And it has to be.
We all need to ask ourselves and others, and when illness strikes, we need to be open to each other and tell each other to fight together.
This is not the first case of Ebola, and it is not the last. There are numerous germs waiting outside.
And the next time something like this happens, it could happen in hundreds of thousands of cities.
It may be an airborne disease.
It may even be deliberately spread.
I know that it is also scary, but I also know this, and this experience shows that we have the skills and ability to overcome this.
But we can do it together and we must do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan, and for the countless others who have always been at the forefront of this struggle, let us always join them in this struggle.
Let us not define it as a world destroyed by a virus, but let us unite and be enlightened by the minds and thoughts of billions of people.
Thank you.
