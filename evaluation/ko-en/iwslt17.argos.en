This story is a story about how we know.
This story is a story about this woman. Natalia Reefkinski.
She is a high school student. That is, she is a professional to break dead things very long ago.
Natalia Reefkinski: I'm calling the "Leather Dr." of the four.
Ratif Screw: And I’m interested in her because she’s where she’s getting stuff. She works in the North Pole toondra region, far above.
In the summer of 2006 she was on the excavation scene called Fyles Leaf Bed. It is a place where the road is not falling 10 degrees from the north Pole.
Natalia: What did I do? I didn't have a problem. If you’re looking for a backpack on the day, you’ll be able to pick up your GPS and laptop and look like a fossil.
Latina: and in any moment she realizes something.
Natalia: I've been rusty, and I've got my palm of the same color.
It was just off on the ground floor.
Latif: In the first time she thought it was just a wooden piece. Why? Before Fyles Leaf Bed, people discovered the plant fossil in the prehistoric period.
But the night of the day, return to the camp
Natalia: I’ve got a little closer to see it. It does not look like this.
I thought it might be a stuff to preserve. But this is really
I was like a bone.
Latif: So over four years, she continued to explore its area. And eventually gathered bone pieces like 30 pieces. Most were really small pieces.
Natalia: It's not a great job. I'm going to enter one of my ziplocks.
Latif: And she tried to fit the bone as it fits the puzzle.
But it was very difficult.
Natalia: I've been using sand and splicing agent too much. I'm not good.
So finally, I was shooting with 3D scanners.
Latina: Oh! Natalia: I've done right?
Lab: In fact, that way was much easier.
Natalia: It was like magic to make a piece one.
Ratif: How much is this piece?
Is there any possibility that I didn't assemble? Is it not a bone of small kinks or other things?
Natalia: Well, No. No, it's perfect.
Ratif: According to her, she is a raft that she found. Leg bones. And precisely, the leg bones of the mammals that the excavated. It's a kind of animal.
But there were no two animals.
Because the bone is too large.
Natalia: size was really big It was a bone of very large animals.
Ratif: What animal is that?
During the distress, she showed the piece one to the colleagues in Colorado and they gave good feedback.
Natalia: We saw a piece at the end. And in that break, it was really interesting smell.
Latina: Like the smell of the flesh.
The smell was the smell that she was in charge when she listened to the soft anatomy class. Collagen smelled.
Collagen plays the structure of bone.
And if the usual time is flowing, it will be burned.
However, in this case, the Arctic was preserved by natural refrigeration and excavation.
After 1, after 2 years, Natalia demonstrates that her colleagues Mike Berkeley at the Institute at Bristol demonstrated "Colagen Fingerprinting".
The content is that different species have different collagen structures by little. So if there is a collage structure of the bone, it is possible to compare the structure of the species that revealed. And it’s not what you’re looking for.
So she sent a piece one to his colleagues. Pets
Natalia: Yes, try to check the shipping. About Us
Latif: And he analyzed and compared to the modern mammal species that revealed 37 species
We've found matching.
The result of the investigation, this bone is the master of the bones of the bones that represent Natalia as a bone of 350 million years ago.
It was abortion.
Natalia: I was at the time. About Us {{if compare_at_price_min > price_min}}
Latif: So the other pieces have progressed the inspection and the inspection results were all the same.
However, due to the size of the bones found, this optimistic means 30% or greater than the modern optimisation.
This fall is about 1 ton of weight in 9 feet.
About Us
Natalia found a huge polar polar polarization.
Now, I think you’ve heard of the word ‘Nata’. East Asia, Central Asian Couples,
I don't know if you are usually in the postcard, I don't know that there is a shortcut. It is a animal that lives in a typical desert, and it is a habit of hot deserts. It is a animal that lives in the same place as the Middle East or Sahara, and has a big hump and so on, saves moisture for long desert trekking, and goes beyond the sand hills with large and wide feet.
How did this friends come to the Arctic?
Well, scientists knew it from a long time ago. It is true that it was revealed before the discovery of Natalia is from the United States.
Here’s the beginning of the fall.
It’s the first time to opt out about 4 million to 45,000 million years ago, and it’s only in North America. There are more than 20 papers and it can be found.
Latif: Can I compare all of the dwarfs?
Natalia: Yes, Mithas differ in different sizes
There is a very long neck. It's actually a paradise.
Latif: What kind of bells are the same spouts?
Natalia: The fall of the raw step was really small. Like almost a rabbit.
What is Latif? Is it a rabbit size?
Natalia: I’m abortion in the four-week phase.
I'm going to see you probably came out.
Latif: I want to grow a rabbit in the world.
Natalia: Low. Is it OK?
Latif: And go beyond one of the umamis of the umamis of the umamis of the umamis before about 3 to 7 million years ago. In that place, it evolves into Lamar and Alpaca. The other species go beyond Asia and Africa through the Berring Bridge.
And in the end of the Glacier, North America will be extinct.
Scientists knew everything. But Natalia did not fully explain what was found in the north.
For example, if you look at the temperature, the extreme regions are completely opposite with Sahara.
If you’re going to talk exactly, it’s usually warmed about 20 degrees Celsius than now.
So the Arcticism will be the forest of the Han River. Like today’s Yukonju and Siberia.
But it’s still an area that the winter lasts for 6 months, and the water pit is frozen
It is a place where the eyes are coming.
It is a region that has been around for 24 hours.
How ... What is it?
How could this Sahara Superstar survive in the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her colleagues think of one hypothesis.
And it was a considerable idea.
What are the facts that we can adapt well in places like Sahara? About Us
If the wide foot of the fall is not to cross the desert, but to walk the snow? I'm sorry.
If the fall of the fall -- I was a big news. If you don’t have a water, you’ll have a fat, and if you’re in the winter of six months that you’re lacking to eat?
And later, if the optimist crosses the Berring Bridge and then it was converted to the hot desert environment for the winter?
For example, it will be helpful in hot climates, etc. Because the fat in the body is immersed in one place, it is like a vegan in the body. So it is not necessary to have insulation wrapping the whole body.
It is easy to block humps in etc.
While it sounds like a strange sound, the essence of the falla can live in the desert is that the falla can be a proof of living in the Arctic.
In fact, this story is not my first.
Others will see this and be the key of evolutionary biology or the future climate change.
But why I like this story is different.
I think this is a story about us. I think how we look at the world and how it differs.
I am a scholar.
And many scientists have realized that it is like a scholar.
It seems like to prove the past.
Scientists also talk about the life of the universe, earth, and earth.
And as a scholar, I thought that this story is going everywhere.
Natalia: We create a hypothesis and think the hypothesis is true. It's like that it's in the desert. What is it?
The perfect story! I've been completely faithful.
The more scary falls on the desert.
Latape: But what moment you find very small evidence
In that small thing, everything you know about is that it can be reversible.
In this case, scientists discover a piece of wood that knows the lines and science as it has become a completely new and semi-permanent theory about why the animals that occur like this Dr. Sus.
And the thoughts on the dwarves were completely backed.
It is a animal that can only grow in a specific environment. It is a animal that travels the world from rare animals. It is not true that there is no place in the world.
This friend is very good.
Hello! What is it?
Here, eat this one.
It’s very easy to wait during regular performances. Radio City Music Hall is a performance.
Not a joke.
What’s new? What’s new?
We need to adapt again and imagine again.
About Us What is it?
And actually a small bone piece one has updated the world we see.
About Us
Today's computer is too surprised and how terrible it is at the same time.
I’m going to know today’s problem and show how to solve it with neuroscience.
First, we will tell you the important event that happened to me in the cold night of Harem in 2011.
I was sitting in a bar outside of the University of Colombia. Here I studied computer science and neuroscience. I’ve been immersed in conversation that I’m going to replace my computer with friends at the bar.
And the conversations of us cheerfully cheerfully, the friend cell phone was crying.
A friend started typing while pulling under the cell phone.
and speaking while watching me by raising the eyes, “Continued. I’m listening to you.”
But there was no opening of the friend's eyes. The moment was already cooled.
On the other hand, other students were extruded to work by getting out of their phone.
He has overdue the photos of Instagram and has been smiling with the work.
The feeling of the mood, while at the same time, the fact that it is happy is the same technique.
And the more you think, the content of the digital information itself is not pouring another result, but simply, according to the direction of the screen, and the friends were separated and realized that the lower is broken together.
When my friends are connected to the cellphone, the old predators were surrounded around the mortgage, and they were able to talk about social ability.
The tools you think should be functional like this.
You must have the extension of your body.
And I see today's computer is a elaborate.

I see this is wrong. I think you can use much natural machines.
We need to use the machines to do things in real world.
We need to extend the feeling without backing to our sense by applying the neuroscience principle to the machine.
There are such machines right now.
This is Meta 2.
Let's write it.
I can see you and my hands in front of my eyes.
Set, both, one washable hologram appears. Now in front of the front is very realistic in the form of hologram, right before that device I'm writing right now.
This hologram is also a product that we shop, and it is also an expedition. And you can move your hands to calmly.
It is a sight to be proud of Iron Man.
This machine will meet again after a while.
If you’re like me, you’ll be imagining what you can do with this technology. Copyright (c) 2015 SHINSEGAE. All Rights Reserved.
The mother is the architect. Naturally I thought the building expresses to 3D. Design of 2D as now.
The mother has a graphical touch and also choose a built-in decoration.
This scene is a real shooting video in Meta 2.
More Yes, it is a transparent brain project of Adam Gasalli professor. UCSF's commitment
As a neuroscientist, I always imagined learning and loneliness of complex brains with the help of the machine. Developing complex brain structures. This technology is called ‘the realism’.
But I think it is a process that extends our body’s ability to move further from this. That's not.
News
After a few years, humanity will be a great transformation.
Humanity will begin to build a layer of digital information that corresponds to the real world.
Imagine what this changes. Talkers, painters, brain and doctors, indoor decorations, tell us where.
And I’m sure that we’re all worthy and many attempts and efforts to discuss the direction to create these new reality, and we’ll not be able to make it like a game or just fill it with information.
And I am very passionate about this work.

This is not a minimal device within about 5 years. Thin glass band mode will be improved within 5 years. And as we look at the operating system rather than hardware when we buy a cell phone, I dreamed to create an iOS for the spirit as a neurosciencer.
The development of this OS is very discreet, because we can long live in the new OS as we use Windows.
I don't know, but I'm going to live in Windows.
In order to find the most intuitive interface for users, we are located in the core of the design and we cannot see the design in the meeting room.
When designing, we always rebels are looking for “the less aging”
In all stages, we are trying to connect the mental iOS to the brain. Let us know differently, we will create a computer that doesn’t require a description of use.
We create a computer that can be used independently.
More Three Design Instructions for New User Experience
What we are looking for The first thing to do is
You will be operating system.
The existing file system is complex and intuitive, so you can understand your brain.
It does not mount the most latency circuit.
In augmented reality, you can set the hologram TED screen here, and the email can be placed on the opposite side, and you can use the space capacity of reality to pull the hologram.
You can also turn the Tesla tea that was shopping. Before the lecture, the law team will be aware of the differences that have been used.
About Us Brains perfectly understand this process.
The second instructions are / “I see it” and it is called.
How do babies take care of something baby?
Let's try to stretch your hands.
This is how natural machine works.
In order to demonstrate a large visual system, it is revealed that it should feel where the body is system.
If you can directly touch, you can not only understand the ease of operation, but also the content deeper.
I'm going to see.
But the experience of yourself is not enough.
We are social animals.
This is our third instruction. It is a wool of hologram that stretches on the story.
By the mirror of the human body, we can immerse the face and hands of others into the 3D.
If you’re looking at the back of the video, you’ll be surprised by two meta users to play with the same hologram and give each other eye to the eye. It is not to fall each other because of the device.
Let’s put my neuroscience into mind and write the device again.
back to iOS for the spirit.
This time, we will put this device by hand and next to the desk.
I am with you. We are here.
I can put this device according to my space capacity and put it in place again. I'm working with you.
Now, while self-hydration works, I can disassemble this device as thousands of parts and touch the sensor immediately after scanning my hand.
But let’s try to look alone, but let’s try to make a co-founder Ray and 3D call. About Us

Your message is found in 2011. The future of the computer is not trapped in the neon screen.
Just here, we are within.
I can tell you today, the natural machine is not a future science and is in 2016.
Meta has already created this device, so hundreds of Meta’s administrations, executives, designers, and technicians will be locked all the monitors in the company before TED2017, and will change to true, really natural machines.

Thank you very much. I'm sorry.
I’m from Seattle, USA’s most free democratic and progressive.
I grew up in the house that I believe Seattle is the best.
My mother was an artist and my father was a professor at the University. Thank you very much for your understanding. I could design my life comfortably.
But the fact that the parents did not follow the way they want.
I was swelling the university, and I was chasing and skewing.
I found a franch horn professor at the dream.
I’ve played an indoor music in the United States and Europe. Charlie Burdra was a great jazz guitarist and traveling for the next year.
At the end of the 20th century, the Spanish Barcelona Symphony Orchestra was recalled.
It is a wonderful life.
My parents don't want to complain about it.
Thank you for your support.
They didn’t want.
My parents were talking about neighbors and friends as follows. "Our Son is in Blank."
And there was a little uncomfortable conversation about my life. I want to talk to you.
I returned from Barcelona when I was 27 years old. I’m looking for a Christmas gift. I was cooking in the kitchen with my mother.
I'm so sorry.
something wrong.
I’ve been a mother. "Mother, what's it?"
"My father and I'm really worried about you."
So I said. “I’m going to know now?”
"I'm going to tell you all the words: I've voted for the public?"
Yes, in fact, I was just a French Horn Concert without interest in politics.
But what happened, my parents knew it and what happened.
I have become a passionate supporter of capitalism. We will tell you why.
That’s why I’m going to be my life’s concern.
I remember when I saw my first accused in Seattle.
We had a little lower than the middle layer, but we didn’t go.
I didn't feel like it.
In the early 1970s, I saw the real body of the first gospel, and I was born in the early 1970s.
I was just a normal child.
I’ve seen a photo of the next child in East Africa, which was written in the National Geographic magazine. His face is full of Paris and the abdominal was inflated.
I've seen that he could not live.
If you have any questions, please contact us. Even if it is not one of the pictures.
It is that there is no dam in the world to show it to the Western.
The photograph was harasing me until I was aged to go school. I went back to school and gave my family.
And what is the child?
I wonder how such people around the world were.
So, I didn’t go to college and I started studying. I'm looking for answers: What happens to the poorest people in this world?
Is it better? Is it better?
I'm looking for answers. I'm going to change my life. We will share with you.
Look-- Most Americans believe that poverty has become more wicked than their years.
If the U.S. frequented the "world frequented?", 70% of people say that the problem was serious than early 1970.
But true
I’ve changed my thoughts.
Since 1970, it has been reduced by 80% of its veterinary ability to live in less than 1 USD per day to the world.
Since I was a child, the poverty of the world has reduced by 80%.
I didn't know.
That’s really great.
We need to celebrate.
This is the best record for the human history. And that thing happened in this age now we live.
I've been wondering if I'm going to know it. How? How does it work?
If you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If you don’t know why, you’ll be able to save 2 million frequent people from the go. That's our topic: When I was a young child, a minimum of 20 billion people came out of his sleep.
I’ve been 20 billion other people.
I'm looking for answers.
I don't have any political answer.
Still, I'm not interested in politics.
I'm looking for answers in all aspects of the economy.
The answer is this.
See the reason.
There are five reasons why the 20 billion people can’t get away from the wild.
First: Globalization.
Second: Free Trade.
Third: Bingo Right
Third: The provisions of law
5th: Founding.
The large-scale free business system that makes it possible to work spread all over the world in the 1970s.
No sound.
Free business is not perfect, but it is not all necessary for us to make a better world.
That's great.
Not political.
Here is what I learned. This is true.
The capitalism is not just about the accumulation.
It’s the best, it’s about the foremost. Many people were talking about this stage. Pobu is coming from a dream and is made in a free business.
You need to share with more people. Similar to the first
The second story. We will develop both home and the world.
My favorite quote is what I say. What to save a person in poverty. Follow us: “We created the largest market in history.”
They walked a billion blank.
Who said this?
Like Milton Predman or Ronal Reagan.
About Us
The President Obama is one word.
How do I remember?
I've said to me.
.
I said "Heruleya" before.
I've said, "I'm waiting."
What do I think?
In May 2015, there was a event that we participated in the Georgetown University.
And before that’s about the biggest problem that Americans face today
I thought the answer was. What is it? That's why. Advance and repair, to people who need us the most.
I'm not going to say that we're in crisis. The U.S. and the world are different from political anodes.
We have reached the crisis situation.
Not good Not right.
It was one of the articles last year. The National Academy of Science was written in the State of Science, one of the prestigious scientific journals in Western province.
And this is an article about political imbalances published in 2014.
What is this? What is the fact that psychologists say that their thoughts are true in love, and what is the phenomenon of believe that the opposite is from the testimony?
The answer is a common conflict.
It can be seen in Palestine and Israel,
The authors of this article today found that most public officials and democrats are suffering from political imbalances.
Those who do political activities today believe that their motivation is baptized and oppressed.
I think.
Many people walked and said, "Aldashifi my love is to help others, but others do not interfere with evil."
It will not develop a group with such asymmetrical.
I'm sorry.
How to solve?
Let's go honestly: There is a difference.
You can cultivate differences: It's really pure.

TED Stage Veteran representative Jonathan Hydro.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He explores people’s love, value, morality to see the difference. As he showed, the progress and democratics think that different things are important.
For example, Jonathan Hait wrote about poverty more than 59% of the progression.
And the convenant has more than 28% of economic freedom than poverty.
Is it possible to use a car?
I can't do anything. About Us
It is that diversity is rich.
Don’t forget what’s blank.
In the world, the land of the economic freedom and the land of poverty were spreading.
We need each other again. If you want to get the next 20 billion population from poverty
There is no other way.

We need to be less predictable.
What is it?
When do we think our illusion is predictable?
About Us
Do you want to hear only the story of a person who has always been devoting?
Why is it dangerous?
We talk about the economy in this country, and conservatively talk about taxes and regulations, and governments.
And we’re talking about the import imbalance of the economy on the future.
About Us This is important. It is also important to you too.
But if you think hunger man, it’s just a mess.
You must find the best room. If you want to get an empty stomach with the best implement, the conservant needs progress and understand the frequent consolidation of the progress party, and the progress party needs a conservant, and understand the consolidation of the free market.
It is a variety of things that make this country more exciting. If we realize
What should I do? How can I get together?
There are a number of actions for you and me.
First. The first action hand: remember, and do not know what the other person is doing.
It's not only.
You need to know if you want to run us. For those who need our solutions, we need it.
What to do in the future? How to run?
Where to start? Go straight.
All of us here are Blessed.
What are you waiting for?
We received the blessing of prosperity and received the blessing of leadership.
When people are talking about unpredictable thoughts, they will probably be grateful.
From there, development starts.
That's the first.
Second: I ask you and herself It is said that it can be a person who can be nursing and explaining the boundaries of the difference.
If you’re a conservative wave, you’ll always talk about poverty and moral obligations as a hero of poverty.
And if you’re a progressive wave, you’ll be able to discuss issues with the benefits of free market.
If so, we have two benefits:
First: We will solve the problem about the next 20 billion people. You must see this solution in the past even in the future.
The second is to change the nation’s commitment to mutual respect through mutual respect.
And maybe you will know that the difference is not so big.
About Us
When I graduated from a university, I studied political science. There are many challenges you need to write.
In general, students will disperse things in this way when they are doing their tasks.
You are here In the first time you start a little slow, but if you do it in the first week, then all things will be organized.
I want to do so.
Let’s go!
We will be ready for you. However, if it is true, it will be.
This happened every challenge.
Graduated from the 90th degree of quantitative medicine. It was a paper that should invest in a year.
I know that this task is not as usual.
It’s so important.
So I thought I would like to plan and do so.
I'm sending this year.
In the first time, it’s time to get started, and it’s time to increase the speed in the middle, and it’s time to get out of the last. Just like a small stairs.
How hard to climb stairs?
About Us What is it?
But really happened.
Home
I just went over time and I didn't have a lot.
So, we created a plan revision.
But after that, the middle moon was not just passed and wrote. That's why.
The two months have become one month and that’s another two weeks.
And it was not a text that was left in three days. So I can do it. I wrote 90 for 72 hours. It's not a day, and it's a little night. If you are human, you shouldn’t miss this night. And dives with slow motion across the campus, so it’s time to finish.
I've done it.
But the phone has been in school after a week.
"I'm a team?" Follow us
I'm, "Yes."
"I'm talking about the comment." About Us
I'm, "Please."
The school is here. “It’s the best paper ever seen.”
There was no such thing.
Very, very pleasing paper.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment you think. "This man is great!"
No, no, it's really simple.
Anyway, I'm a blog writer.
"However, why" the blog is running.
A few years ago, I tried to write about mirugi.
My behavior has always been dignified to people who do not miss things around. I wanted to explain them. What we do and what we do in the heart of a person, and why we do.
I've been one of them. The brains of people who do things are different from the brains of others.
In order to validate this, we found the MRI research room to scan the two brains and scan the brains of a valid unknown person.
I’m going to show you today.
Please see more about the difference.
If you’re not a brain specialist you’ve been trained, you’re not sure that you’re going to look at once.
This is the brain of people who are not mirrored.
News
This is my brain.
There is a difference.
There are two "consultant decision makers" but there are also "permanent satisfaction monkeys" in the brain of people.
What does this mean to do?
This means that all things are fine.
[I would like to make it right now] [No!] We are committed to providing you with the best products and services to you. But the monkey is not like that, so it says that the man is holding the driver. "Nishi Keigan and Tona Harding Scanning on the Wikipedia page to read the Montan. The scans were just right. And let's go to the refrigerator and let's see what's new than 10 minutes ago.
And after entering the YouTube, Richard Pine started with a video explaining the magnet, and finally see the video that interviews Justin Beaver Mom.
It’s all time, so today there’s no time to do anything.
News
What happens?
The momentary satisfaction of the monkeys is not a lover who wants to catch the driver.
He is completely living in the current moment.
There are no knowledge about the past memory or the future, and only two neurons. Easy and interesting things.
The world of animals is still fine.
If you’re a dog, it’s a successful life!
This monkey is the animal of the other species.
You can eat well, eat well, and eat well. If you are in a short period of time, you will be.
I don't know, but now is not a short period.
It is now an advanced era of civilization, but the monkeys know that.
There is another presence in our brain. We have the ability to do things that can’t be done right in “combined decision makers” and we’ll give you the ability to do things that can’t be done.
You can dream of the future,
can also be seen,
You can make a long-term plan.
Reasonable decision makers try to consider all of these
I want to make a reasonable job now. What time is easy and interesting to do
It’s time to fit. It is said when eating dinner, sleeping, or sending good leisure time. So there is a part of each other.
In any case, the comments are met.
However, there is a lot more reasonable time to work if you don’t have to worry about it. For larger means.
When you go straight, you will get the same.
For those who wish to work, such conflicts end in the same way. It is easy to get out of the rational kingdom, and it is a great time to spend a lot of time in this orange zone.
I call that there is "the playground of darkness."
The dark playground is a great place for people who want to do things.
It is a place where the activity is taken, and in some cases, it is not possible to do activities.
It is not fun in the dark playground. I don't want to play. The air of the place is a feeling that everyone feels that are full of guilt, horror, anxiety, and self-confidence.
The problem is that the monkeys in this situation will gain, how it works Miru's people are blue. It’s less fun, but it’s where it’s important.
For those who wish to work, there is a guardianship. It’s time to see him, and it’s the most scary moment, and it’s just a pony monster.
Picnic monsters are closed at most times, but they are terminated in the nose forward, they suddenly wake up if they have a risk of harasssing or harassing in their career, or if they have a risk of harassment.
It’s important that the monkeys are the only thing that makes it scary.
It was very close to my life until recently. I was invited to talk about me 6 months ago from TED.
Of course, I'm gonna do.
I’ve always dreamed of TED.
We are here to help you. We are here to help you.
He, "I know what we are accepting?
What happened on the day of the future certainly understand?
You need to start sitting right now. .
"I agree entirely, but now I just open the Google Earth and expand the southernmost of India to better know the Indians, let's scroll up for two hours and half until it arrives in the Indian Book, at 200 feet above sea level."
So that day was that.
6 months have become 4 months, 2 months, and TED officials announced the lecturer.
I’m going to see my face is straightforward.
Who is it?
So the panic monsters start to miss the thirst. After a few seconds, all the systems were far away.
The monkeys that dispel the pony monsters are woven, bolted up the wood!
In this lesson, we were able to make a lecture work by Dr. D. D. D. D. D. D. D. D.
The pony monster describes the behavior of people who are indispensable to do. The first sentence of the challenge is to pass through two weeks, and the same people find logical consciousness, and write eight times.
All these situations are described as three figures. This is the system of people who miss things.
It is not a good shape, but it is finally effective.
So I wrote about this about a few years ago.
When writing, the reaction of people was surprised.
We have a wide range of people who are working around the world.
We have been students with nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and jumbo doctors.
They all said to be the same. "I have the same problem."
But I’m surprised that the blog’s posts are light, and the email was very serious.
This people really want to answer how life was. What kind of monkeys have done for themselves.
I thought this was. Why is the system of people who mourn work?
What are you waiting for?
There were two types of mirug, I knew.
Today, there were different deadlines. When it is finished
The results of miru are limited in short periods. We’re excited to announce that we’re excited to share with you.
However, the second sort of mirrors occur when there is no deadline.
If you want to work in a business such as art or business, there is no deadline for this. You don't want to get anything before doing it. There are many important things that do not have any deadlines in the job.
It is important to meet or exercise your family, look at health, keep your human relationships well and clean your relationships. It is a problem if a person can make these difficult things. Because there is no closure on all of these things, it does not appear in the panic monster. There is no way to wake up.
So the results that are caused by the mirror are not limited and just forever.
This is a long-term mirror, short-term, not much better than a period of time and is not discussed. I'm sorry.
This can be a significant long term unfortunate and subsequent source. I see that people sent an email.
Since they are in a very good situation. They are not such a challenge.
A long-term miraculous
Sometimes you feel like a viewer of your life. The answer is not dreaming
I didn't have to leave my dreams. So I read these emails and got a little real thing, but it does not exist.
About Us Everyone is the people who are all mirrored.
Whatever you do, you don’t know that it’s like us. You may have a stolen stolen but remember, the stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen stolen.
I would like to see one thing.
I'm calling this a life calendar.
Each week of 90 years of life has one box.
It is not a lot of cases. In particular, we wrote a lot of boxes already.
I think you need to see this calendar for a long time.
We need to think what we’re doing. Everyone knows something in life.
You must always be conscious of the momentary satisfaction of the monkey.
That’s what we all need.
The calendar has not been a lot left, so you probably need to start today.

About Us
That day we were sending the last day of our lives and souls gathered in the Texas Church.
It is similar to this room here, but the grater was behind the sandy red cloth that was old in the woods, and the climb was on the left and the sanctuary on the left. The three-time bathtub was installed on the walls behind the castle.
I've been here.
Like this, there was no tension, and the hope of salvation was full, and there was a sweat in the hands and people sitting on the back were not focused.
The day was December 31, 1999 and I knew that it was the day of the end of the world.
I have been 12 years old and I have been aged to feel the responsibility.
And I’ve heard that Jesus was indispensable when I’ve been responsible for one thing, and I’ve been thinking that I’ve been better to clean up the house very soon.
So the church was most often done.
I was impressed by the sound as much as I was impressed by God. And I went back to the house early.
Jesus was reorganized, and I read the "wintered people" that was fashion at the time and prepared an alternative.
In the book I had a chance if I don’t get out of the condolences in my self-esteem.
In order to do this, I have to avoid receiving the expression of the beast, and fight with the devils and epidemics.
I'm sorry. But I believe it can be.
But the plan is over time.
The clock was 11:50.
10 minutes left until the rim, and the Pastor sent us to the chair to the Foundation. It is because I wanted to pray when I was sick.
So everyone of the gods gathered together.
The Holy Son, the Holy Son, and his wife, who remained in the place of the Holy Son, sat before the foundation.
In the United States, there are VIP seats on the day of Jesus regret.
And there was a fisherman behind the pilgrimage Burjuah. The hot sun of the eastern madison farm in the eastern texas was made to bend the waist of these young days and the pleat brown skin of these were burned like the mud of the eastern texas and the dreams and hopes of life outside the eastern texas are sometimes more baked and broken than their baked waist.
It was the protagonist of the day that the Arshins were.
They have been waiting for a lifetime for this moment. It seems that the ancestors of the Middle Age have seen the end of the world. And if my grandmother waits to be at 4 o'clock on the 8th channel every day.
When the grandmother came to the foundation, I was glittering behind the grandmother. I believe that the grandmother will go to heaven, and when he catches his grandmother’s hands during prayer
I thought it would be possible to go like me. So I'm holding hands and impressed my eyes. to listen and wait.
The prayer is greater and the call of response to prayer is greater
More and more were spreading.
This was the song of the Organese.
It also has more sweat on the hot air.
I'm going to go hand and don't want to go alone.
I've been trying to make my eyes look more and do not want people to go off.
And praying to us, the voice is crying. "Amen"
Ended.
Watch
I've already passed my self-confidence.
I’m looking at the amazing things. They did not come to life. They didn’t see disappointment, but they’ve been too much and too long to believe that they’re now suspicious.
I’ve been angry when I’m at their stool.
They have been all over the world, and they have been eating skewers and skewers. And I’ve been together with them right side.
I prayed for them and tried not to fall in temptation.
I’m going to head twice or twice as long as I’m in the pilgrimage tub that I’m going to go.
I believe it.
What should I do now?
When I returned home, I could see Peter Jennings declared the New Year when I was wrong. I'm back to the world.
The thoughts here were more than that of the time that Jesus went through the world.
This was made me more slammed and it was really sick.
But that day I did not lose faith from there.
just started to believe new. It is impossible to believe.
The answer I have had wrong and the problem itself might be wrong.
And as soon as the mountain is large, the confidence has been shed into its origin. It was a suspicious fountain. It is a fountain that promised the river.
I remember the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day of the day. I know that I’ve been the most believe, and this is not a false, but it’s not true.
Many of you have welcomed Y2K in different ways, but here’s why we’re sure that your part has experienced me. Since the beginning of the new year, the mother is left and the father is far away from the beginning of the old year, and after the old days of the old year.
I found a place where I'm waiting for my hands and cherish them.
I have been enrolled in the 18th year old. Oak Clifton is a faith that has come from Texas. I’ve been a chance that I’ve been able to do numerous tests and bodies and minds behind the sight.
But when I returned to the house in a winter vacation, I found that it was a gun of strength that was drawn back to the floor with my face and back. I’ve learned that I can’t save much of studying.
I’ve been internship in 2008, and I’ve been faithful to Reman Bros.
We’ve been full of hope and we’ve been calling our family and we’ve never been doing so.
But I’ve noticed that the identity of this financial can’t be saved in the best workplace after witnessing it in front of my eyes.
I’ve been working as a young employee in Washington DC, and I’ve also called faith. I have believed that it was difficult to come from Illinois to "to go." But this election will change the United States." It was because the voice was heard.
But the National Assembly does not function, and all countries have come to know that the hopes and changes are felt like a cruel joke and the rebels of political salvation cannot save me.
I prayed to the god of this age, kneeling before the altar of American Dream. The success is to the god of money power.
But it continues to look at the eyes in the middle of the night and all the gods are dead.
I started searching once again in the midst of desperate. I know that it is not good for me, but it is not true that I believe or die or stand on the road.
So I left a pilgrimage to another holy place. Harvard Business School I knew that I could not accept salvation that claimed this fact.
But I knew that it was more to do.
The work began in a problem with three friends and one question I have seen in the dark corners of many parties. Young people who are looking for the truth were asked for a long time. "If you leave a trip to the car?"
We didn’t know how to go anywhere, but we’ve just had to go.
Because we’ve been living in the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the life of the Jack Kerub's novel, we’ve learned how people live around the world.
So other people were too big and evidenced, but we left.
In 2013, we traveled around the U.S. to 8 thousand miles. Through the storm of Montana, the dumb of Detroit crosses the swamp of New Orleans and worked with people. They were people who were in line with the basics of life through their duties.
And I was shocked in this innovative look, whether it is in Western capitalism.
And this idea is growing into a non-profit foundation, MBAs Across America. It’s a workout that I’m here.
This exercise has been spread deeply about the purpose and meaning of our generation.
This exercise has many businesses here and is changing the lives of working across the United States, and the help is a little bit of need.
However, if you say honestly, this exercise has been spread since I've been cheaper.
I’m going to go anywhere to spread this Gospel. More people believe that we can sew this teared country one social company
But the journey to spread this gospel was different to the gospel. Today I'm the gospel I want to share with you.
About a year ago, there was an event for Harvard Business School at the Museum of Natural History in New York.
There was a whale model of the actual size. I’ve been sitting together with the gods of our age and they were celebrating their achievements with colleagues.
It was full of pride. Since the net asset and property operating under the management team exceeded $500 billion.
It is good to see what we look like.
But another thing was behind the two days. I’m going to spread the Gospel to Harlem. I’ve heard that I’ve been sitting in the city farm once it was a ballet, and I’ve heard that I’ve been talking about the children that come every day.
These children were all doing extreme life.
There are many children who have all of them in the bag. I'm trying to lose in the shelter.
Some of them take part in 'Harlem Grown', which is operated by Tony, to solve the only one of the day.
Tony has launched 'Harlem Grown' and said. 20 years of taxi driving.
He was a successful program, but it was because he needed support.
I would like to thank you for your understanding.
And I helped him.
However, it felt that the eyes are warm and tears are sticking to the eye.
I felt the weight of the revelation. On any day, there are hundreds of people with $500 million in any room and behind the two days, it is a reminder that someone will give up a lot of money at 50 blocks away from the other room.
It is not to shed tears due to a pronounced complaint. It is not to shed tears on the thoughts of hungry children left on the way. It is not a verb for the rage or the rest 99% for the top 1%.
The reason why I have not seen the chest is because the kidneys have realized that it is only in the country where it is necessary.
I realized that my story was instead of the people who were poisoned by the bootstelling. The organization that I run was instead of the structured systematic help of Harlem or Aphrachia, New Orleans, and felt that my voice was instead of learning, nail washing, and the voice of those who do not live.
And it began to push the slipperyness of this. Peter Jennings sits in front of Tybee, and when he felt again and again, he felt like a loudness.
I've been confusing and confusing.
But this time's false phrase was just me.
I’m going to see the world’s end, and I’m going to walk far from the altar. It is the true truth that the people are absolutely true that God is the necessary act of suffering and written in the Bible.
Yes, I’m going back and I’m back to the place I started.
Because we can not simply say that we live in the age of unbelievable. Today we have faith as many people without the number of previous people.
We will also have people who believe in the prophecies of Brene Brown or Tony Robins.
We will also have people who believe "New Yorker" or "Hard Business Review" like the Bible.
Here we will gather to the TED church and be the deepest reliable when raising the worship. But we need to believe in it.
We are promised to solve all our problems like the charismatic leaders
It is a true that the pain is the need of the capitalism that we believe, and the development of the technology is not possible.
And when we do not have this small question, we don’t realize almost anything about the man’s comment. Because we are afraid to shake our entire foundation.
But if you’re in the absolute things we’ve accepted, it’s time to get a question.
I am not to talk about the conflict or reform or the Gospel of the new corporate performance measurement principles.
I’m not going to spread the Gospel of faith today.
I’m going to spread the Gospel of doubt.
The Gospel of Suspicious is not saying that you believe. Instead, say that we believe new things. It is impossible to believe.
We may have the right answer with and people who believe it may be wrong.
About Us The Gospel of Suspicious is that all of us gathered here may be wrong.
Because this gospel is "Why?"
Why should people still suffer from this?
MBAs Across America, the organization that I run.
We will leave our staff and close the door and share our business model for free. If you have the ability to do this, you can do it without our permission.
This question has given some people to give up the role of salvation. Because we wait for the deforestation of the salvation, our life is too short and likely to be blurred. In fact, in this world there is no miracle in the situation.
And this doubt will give you a better strength and give hope. When we’re in care, we’ve seen that we’ve been set in front of us, so when our healers are not better than our eyes, we’re not faith, but our humble doubts are small light in our lives and in the darkness that we’ve been revealed in this world, or we’re striving to increase the voice,
You will be able to hear or simply tell it. It's very simple, "I'm going to have another way."
About Us
Food
Daily appearance on news.
What is the problem?
There are too many places in the world where food is lacking.
Where is GMO?
What is GMO?
Contamination of the sea and other agricultural wastewater. Soil nutrients are reduced
The wicking continues.
And if you're looking for this phenomenon, it's amazing.
How can I feel this word with my skin?
What is this apple?
Recently, about one apple has done.
Do you think this apple would be?
2 weeks?
2 months?
11 months. It is an average age of apples sold at Mart in the United States.
The world is not far different. We are committed to chemicals. There are real cases to lose your life. Because chemicals that are used to slow down apples are harmful to human body. How do I know this fact?
Why did I not know?
When we eat this apple, we lose 90% of nutrients including antioxidant enzymes.
This apple is just a sugar lump.
How can I do this? How can I get better?
It is a platform that lacks us.
Platforms and computers were connected to the internet
There are many strange things on this platform. Thanks to people and I could express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we have a platform, we will be able to ask you autonomously. About Us
I've thrown this question: If the climate is equal?
This is a map that shows the world climate.
The most productive area is green and red.
The climate changes. California farmers have now transformed into Mexican farmers.
China is trying to buy Brazil's land and grow good quality food. We rely heavily on climate.
How can all countries have the best climate?
How to change your life?
What does the quality of life and quality of food affect?
The ration of the previous generation is more cheap and many food needed.
Welcome to the International Farm
We built a large analog farm.
The line shown above is the transport route of cars, planes, trains, etc.
It is important to eat 70 billion people who participated in the agriculture of society.
But it's only....
If you are building a digital international farm?
If this apple is digitalized with any technology, it can be reconfigured from the opposite side of the earth.
About Us
In the future, the Drill Quotation inspired me.
First: ["Japan's agriculture is water, earth, young blood, and there is no future."] I'm inconvenience with arrival at Minami Sanriku in the southernmost of Fukushima.
Young people headed to Sendai and Tokyo, the land is polluted and food is 70% foreign.
However, this phenomenon is not limited to Japan only.
Only 2% of the United States are in agriculture.
2% of the population will be able to arrange the book?
There is no other area. 50% of African population is less than 18 years old.
80% don’t want farming.
Agriculture is high.
The life of a small farmer is empty.
Youngs will enter the city.
In India, farmers are not guaranteed to have minimal infrastructure. The growth rate of farmers for the last 10 years is higher than ever.
It is the true that the mouth is inconvenient.
Where do people stand?
About Us
There are no young people in the farm.
How should I make this platform move the young floor?
New tractor.
It is a harvester.
A few years ago I started making things from Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot.
It is also possible to dance the plants even if you want to make something like a silhouette. It is also possible to connect with a computer. It was dead several times.
So, I have planted the most intimate relationship in my life. because they were in their language.
I wanted to make bigger.
"There is one of the old electronics rooms that nobody wants to
We are looking forward to seeing you.
I was farmed in that with my team. Biology is not a bit of association. Within 18.3 m2
Although there are so many, we have produced a number of quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative quantitative for 300 monthly. In this case, there are interesting technologies.
What is the most interesting part?
Beautiful and Sharden Root Dark Green's Iparis and harvesting of a month
Is this new restaurant?
New retail experience?
What is New Supermarket?
One thing can be justified. Media Lab is the first time to root something.
It is not strange to eat salads in the bowl.
If you’re rooting with video-based processing experts and data scientists and robot technicians, you’ll be thinking of each other. News Maybe I can see it in this field.
About Us I want to see it." In the meantime, we have been carrying out some plants again as a research room. Because you are keying, you can't throw it down.
I have a delicate taste. Because if the plant was delicious,
It is because it is eaten firstly than the middle of every day. Now you can meet the pH of the sardines in a range of 0.1.
"This is a pH 6.1. Today I'm not eating."
This shark was amazingly sweet.
Because these plants have produced chemical reactions to protect themselves by stress. "I will not die!"
The resistance to the living of the plant is only felt by sweet.
We rely on the latest technology, instead of relying on plant physiology.
We thought that others should be able to try this.
I want to see infinite imagination. So, we have moved the lab where you can ship.
The front of this Media Lab is the laboratory. 30 or more sensors per plant.
But if you know genomics or genetics, this is not right phenomena?

If you enter the 60s 70s, they are Nitrogen deficiency, and calcium deficiency
You can find more humidity.
It is not followed by the wisdom.
This is a new eye in the cloud environment.
We find the tendency of data collected over time and we find the association with individual plants.
These figures are all Broccoli’s IP addresses offered on the buffet day.
We now have a period of time that has the IP address of Broccoli.
If you’re ready to be surprised, you can see the profile of the plant.
It shows the growth of the plant. But it’s not to show when it’s simply ripped.
I have achieved the desired nutritional conditions
When you have the taste you want
Water is getting too much
If you are getting too much sunshine
This will give you an alarm for everything. The plant will walk to the ground.
We’ve created our language.
Is it not the first user of the plant Facebook? That plant will start to recurring friend.
Thank you. Low plants need less nitrogen and potassium, but they will become plants and friends that require more people.
Now we’ll let you know about complex associations that cannot be guessed outside. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
The current appearance of the laboratory.
Now the system is a bit caught. I’ve been designing a medical data center, so I know it’s a bit about the environment controlled.
We look forward to seeing various experiments in this environment.
This spraying process is also developed to reduce the water that NASA sends to Mir Space Station.
This process allows the plant to provide the desired load area. Water, mineral resources and oxygen
The root is not so far. If you meet it, you will see a beautiful response.
Same as with two hearts.
That’s because it’s four times faster.
It is a perfect environment.
We have been developing seeds that overcome the adverse environment for a long time. That efforts will continue. However, there are also new weapons that are called us. It is a plant that we try.
It is an unsaturated tomato for 150 years.
Do you know seed banks that store different seeds?
Log In
It's amazing.
There are many different kinds of genital qualities that are preserved and there are many things that do not eat once.
I'm going to be the only one who eats my tomato in this room.

It was also keyed. I'm not sure.
We realize during the experiment is that this device is too large and expensive.
There are about $10 million for installation in multiple locations around the world.
You don’t have to spend $10 million at any time. So I've been making smaller.
In fact, this project is a postgraduate Camille who is a major in mechanical engineering. That’s why Camille and the team were worried about how to make better products cheaper and more performance.
And this machine was installed in the 7-11th grade half of multiple schools.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
Once the students were assigned to their students. “Already fit 65%”
7th grade students were reborn. "What is your habit?"
"Where is the water in the wetland air."
"I have water during the air! Home
So I’ve been advised. "So, don't believe me."

Users can access 3D environments anywhere in the world. Smartphones and tablets are also available.
Users adjust the physical environment and sensor of this machine garden.
You can choose different children from all over the world.
And activate that reproduction and plant seeds.
You can also change the seeds during the big.
"Why do I need carbon monoxide, kill man, not bad for the body?"
They can increase carbon dioxide levels and kill plants
You can also grow well with plants lowering the figure.
When growing plants, new digital cultivation is completed.
This course is a continuation of development and exploration. And users are produced by them
You can download digital relocation and data. It is also possible to compare it to the previous. All this is just the start step. We’re going to learn a lot.
This is "Food Computer". 3 weeks in each school
It’s growing.
However, more important than this is that you have first thought to this child. "I want to become a farmer" or "I want to become a farmer."
We have opened everything.
All contents are open to the web, so make it once a day.
Not easy.
I'm just starting with me.
It is a very important idea that anyone can easily participate.

We will do our best in one platform.
It is so big that the house is too big.
This is a new facility where I started.
You can install anywhere in the world.
I chose this method because of that.
In this warehouse we will create this.
These things are already present.
These are already existed.
The first plant
The second facility will cultivate Ebola vaccine.
It’s one of the reasons why the winners of the Darpa Grand Challenge and the plants that were just seen are human beings ahead of the Ebola Virus.
These plants produce proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
Pharmaceuticals, medicinal foods and supplements
I think that these two are all different in the field
Everything is different.
This field is "I'm okay if it's too much?" It's in the stage that I'm not. We have a small room and boast our own products. "I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I'm not sure."
Don't let me know."
But reality we have now just started.
It is also a time when the society is rapidly changing. In the past, if there were plenty of food
Now, you need a good eco-friendly food. No more than one place in the world’s largest food
Macdonald Chicken Macdonald has been buried in such times that advertise what was made. We are changing all.

Does anyone like Wikipedia add climate-by-flighting laws and what is it implemented in society?
Do you remember this chart as shown?
In the future, the point will occur instead of the line.
Not shipping food itself
We will send food information. This is not my imagination.
This is the direction of humanity. Food computers, servers and
The food data center that is scheduled will connect people. Leave a message
It is not the future of food.
We know what is wrong.
The future of food supply is to connect the farmers of the next generation to the platform to give power and give questions to each other. "What's new?"
About Us
Sometimes I’m really shy when I am European.
In the last year, million people have arrived in Europe. And our response was honest.
There are really many moments.
We have slaped the polar death of the two-year-old Alan Kiri, but after that, more than 200 children have been ripped in the Mediterranean.
We have an international treaty, which recognizes refuge as a joint responsibility. Nevertheless we have received a small Lebanon to accommodate more Syrian than all European countries.
We care about the presence of human beasters. But we are making it the only way that it can manipulate in Europe.
We are experiencing lack of labor force. However, we are blocking people who need to be in Europe for economic and population.
We are insisting the value of freedom to meet Islamic people. But we have a strong policy. The children who want to reign their lives, and the children can drop their families, and gather the property of refugees.
What we do?
How does it work? What are the differences between the two countries?
I do not think people are not interested. No minimum do not want to believe that
I think that our politicians have no vision. There is no vision to change the international refugee system created 50 years ago and apply internationally.
So what I want to do is to ask two very essential questions, we all have to answer.
First, why does the current system work?
Secondly, what should we do to fix this system?
The modern refugee scheme was created in the second world war. This is by people.
The basic goal of this is to ensure that the country fails, or when it is severe, it is to ensure that the people are going and live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It is made for situations like Syria today.
With 147 international agreements with the government, the 1951 Agreement to refugee status and the UN refugee organization, the UN refugee organization, has made mutual acceptance of those who have been deemed from physical conflict and abuse.
But today that system failed.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to request a manipulation.
Indeed, our immigration policy prevents the way to safety.
Theoretically, refugees have right to be accommodated or right to return to their country.
However, in fact, they are trapped in uncertain situations without end.
Theoretically, refugees are the responsibility of the world’s joints.
In fact, if you look at the demographic, the country is overwhelmingly conserving the world refugees of the majority.
This system is not to be broken by the rules.
Because we didn’t apply properly in the changing world. And this will be right to us.
So, we’ll let you know how the current system works.
How do refugees actually work?
We will not be able to see you on the top, but we will tell you about the point of refuge.
Let’s consider one Syrian woman.
Let's call her asmyra.
It is a symbol of many people who come from the region of Zechariah.
Amyra is a woman who has a child like about 25% of the world refugees. And she cannot go home. That's why I'm here. As seen on the screen, the home was now covered with a dungeon.
so I can't return to Ami.
However, Amy is not able to have a reputation that is financially financially in the third country. Because it is a lottery lottery that is allowed only less than 1% of global refugees.
So Amira and her family face almost impossible choice.
There are three choices for them.
The first choice is to take the family to the yard.
You can also get help from the waterhouse, but there is almost no promising to Amyra and the family.
The water soluble is in sulfide and dry almost desert area.
In Jordan’s Zadar refugees, you can listen to the shell sound of the Syrian border nurture at night.
We also have limited liability,
The quality of training is low.
And about 80% of refugees living in the house of the world should stay at least five years.
It’s a life that’s been involved in the end of the year, and only 9% of the Syrians will be the reason for choosing the placement.
In addition, you can also head to the city area of adjacent countries like Aman and Beirut.
This is the method of 75% of Syrian refugees already selected.
But there is also a huge challenge.
There is no right to work in such cities.
It is not a special room that can help.
So Amyra and families are faced with almost no frequent or frequent life to make money left.
So, there are three alternatives, and how many Syrians are stacked.
Amyra is a very dangerous and dangerous trip to other countries for families. This is a phenomenon that we can see in Europe today.
There are three choices that are almost impossible for refugees around the world. Housing life, city poverty, and dangerous travel
The choice for refugees is a global refugee relief today.
But I think this is the wrong choice.
I think we have to think this choice again.
The reason why we are limited to the choice is that we think that the refugees are the only way we can take it, but not true.
Politicals are governed by the Zero Island issue. In this case, if you benefit refugees, it will cost you to the citizens.
We think that refugees are inappropriate costs, or to the burden of society.
but not. They can also contribute.
So what I want to claim is that there is a way that I can do everything while reaming the choices of refugees. It’s all about refugees and organizations, our society and refugees.
And what I want to offer is four ways to change the paradigm for refugees.
These four ways have one common point. It is all to utilize globalization and liquidity, the opportunity of the market, and it is to switch our thoughts on refuge matters.
If you’re thinking about the first time, it’s a part of the supply environment. And this is where refugees depart from the basic awareness of people like us. It’s just a special environment.
We’ve been a research project to observe the economic life of refugees in Uganda along with the third party of Oxford.
The reason why we choose Uganda is not to express the country of residence.
It is very unusual.
Unlike the majority of the world’s capital city, Uganda is to provide economic opportunities for refugees.
We have provided the right to work and provided the freedom of movement.
And the results were enormous in both refugees and society.
In Kampala, we saw that 21% of refugees are doing business that other people are hired, and 40% of the affiliates were affiliate.
If you say again, refugees have created jobs. It is said to be a resident.
In the waterhouse, we found an unusual case, and it was a businessman in the spirit of entrepreneurship.
As an example, we also saw the case of the Congo refugees running digital music business in the residence of Nakibeil.
In addition, Han Rwanda refugee has operated a business where children can play computer games using recycled TV and game consoles.
We are looking forward to providing you with the best products and services. In front of you, this shrine is a folklore called a demonstration kiln,
The demoshop wanted to be a filmmaker even though it came to live with almost empty hands.
So friends, colleagues and Easter Radio Station started, and borrow video cameras and now make movies.
He created the documentary two sides for our team, and created a successful business without almost anything.
This is a case where you can change our response to refugees.
We will not be able to see refugees as well as being able to rely on humanitarian aid, but to provide opportunities to thrive as humans.
Of course, clothes, blankets, shelters, food are all very important in emergency situations. But we need to see that humor.
You need to give them a chance. Direct connection, electricity, education, right to work, capital and finance.
In the global economy, all things that we are involved can be applied to refugees, and must be applied.
The second to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, all the waters of the world do not take action like Uganda.
The majority of the countries are not open to refugees.
But the practical alternative we can take is still present.
Last April, I visited Jordan with my colleagues. Developing economist Paul Coiler has grown ideas while there are. We are working together with international community and government. Supporting the national development strategy of Jordan, providing jobs to Syrian
The idea is to be able to potentially integrate employment in Jordan, a refugee employment and a resident.
It is a state-of-the-art economic zone called King Hesen Bintaral Development Zone, only 15 minutes away from the Zatari refugee residence.
The government has built a network of electrical facilities, and built a road network. But two lacks. It was internal investment with working accessibility.
If refugees were able to work there, would you know if they were able to be able to get the family more than they were trapped in the conservation area and gain skills through job training? Let's go back to Syria.
It will be profitable to Jordan. Yordan’s development strategy is because it requires a leap forward to the mid-sized country through manufacturing.
This can also contribute to the restoration of Syria after a dispute, not only give refugees. The best resource for reconstruction of Syria is that we are aware that we need to build refugees.
We announced this idea in the diplomatic journal,
King Abdullah adopted our idea.
2 weeks ago, the London Syria Conference was announced and will be held for the summer.
The third idea you would like to suggest is to lead a happy result as a photo of Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees here through national and refugee preference matching.
We don’t ask about what we want to refuge, and where we want to go. But I would like to ask this, and I would like to claim that this can be done all together.
Alumni Association We developed a matching market idea. The preferred ranking of the party is the way to match.
Wil Jones and Alex TtelBoim, the idea was also available to refugees. We’ve seen the ranking of destinations that prefer to refugees, and we’ve seen it in technical or language standards.
Of course, there are some of the most common reasons for diversity or vulnerability, but it is still a way to increase the matching possibilities.
Matching ideas are used in many places, for example, you can match your student and university area, or match your kidney transplanters and patients, and are also applied to the algorithms of your dating website.
What does this apply for a great selection of refugees?
It is also possible to apply to the national level. It is a great challenge that we face, and the community is convinced to accommodate refugees.
And for example, in our country we often send engineers and farmers to rural and urban areas. That's not.
So, market matching is a potential way to water all your preferences, and the country of residence, as well as the need and demand of refugees.
The fourth or more you want to say is an Indian visa.
The majority of the polarizations and confusions can be blocked in Europe.
This is due to the fundamental moment of European resonance policy. In order to reign in Europe, you must have a very dangerous journey that has been spoken in front of you.
Why should I do this? It is now in this era with low air and modern projection.
It’s really unnecessary trip, and more than 3,000 people over the past year lost their lives in Europe borders and European territory.
If refugees can travel directly to Europe, but if you can find a manifest, we will be able to do something through being called the Indian Visa. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
If you want to go to the Greek island in Turkey through a millennial, you should get 1,000 euros,
From the boardroom to the franchise, you will be 200 euros.
If refugees are allowed to do so, they will act as a clear advantage.
You can live life, and you can limit the market of the pusher, and you will be able to know that there is no disruption in Europe’s forefront like the Greek island.
To prevent us from doing so is not a reasonable solution but political.
And there are ideas applied here.
Brazil has introduced a pioneering approach, allowing the Brazilian entry into Brazil by publishing an Indian visa for 2,000 Syrian citizens and grant refugees.
Thanks to this scheme, all Syrians have received refugees and were recognized as pure refugees.
There is also a historical example of this.
Between 1922 and 1942, Nansen Passport was used for travel, and 450,000 Asians and Turkish, Chechenin was able to travel Europe, and received refugees from anywhere in Europe.
The Nansen International refugee organization has been recognized as a non-profit organization and has received the Nobel Peace Prize.
So, four ideas I said are how we can increase the choice of Amirah.
How to give refugees more options. Too basic, almost impossible three choices are the way you can do everything like you’ve spoken.
In conclusion, we really need a new vision. It is a vision that can increase the option of refugees, and the vision that refugees don’t need to be recognized as a load.
If you are looking for refugees, everything is possible.
Of course they are human responsibility, but people with skills and talent, inspiration, and ability to contribute. Of course, if we help to do so.
It is not forever to leave this new world.
What we witness in Europe will not last longer.
People will continue to travel, find new settlements, and we need to find a reasonable and realistic way for this. Not based on the old theory of humanitarian support, but not based on the theory of charity, making the right opportunity, based on globalization, market and mobility.
I would like to argue that everyone and the politicians are awaken to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
I dreamed about the sea.
The sea was the world of color and life-filled wilds, and it was a hometown of fantastic life.
I’ve seen a large shark that cultivates feeds and the elegant sea turtle dances across the coral reef.
I’m looking for a fantastic place to dream when I’m most of my career life.
As you can see, I have experienced the world of water since it is quite fish
When I first went to plant, I was 10 years old.
I still remember that I have been lonely to reach the old and hard burial in the coral reefs.
I finally realized that when I was in the hands, I was able to put it up to the dark rainbow light.
That Day I've been in love with the sea
[Tomass Pepper] [Environmental Protection Photographer] I lived in this planet for 40 years and I worked for the National Geographic Monthly and the Seave Awassis Foundation, and it was a great privilege to explore the most beautiful seascape.
I’ve taken numerous creatures from very huge sharks to the ensemble of the palm.
In Canada’s Great Bear in the cold sea in front of the rainforest I smelled the mouth that I eat in front of me.
I was surprised by the blue sea turtles at Mozambique.
All people in this planet affect the sea, and are affected.
It is difficult to find even more natural seas that are difficult to dream.
They are more pressed and threatened.
I have witnessed the wave-level effect that our humans keep the Earth’s leader in food, and left the photo.
I thought that I had to show a shocking photo that the audience will wake up in a convict.
Although this approach is also advantageous, it is returned to the point.
The best way to change is to convey love.
Maybe I’m a kind of medium-sized and photographer, I have a rare opportunity to reveal the animals and ecosystems hidden below.
If you don't know what you do, you can not love and advocate.
The beauty of nature is the power of environmental protection photography.
I visited hundreds of marine locations, but I should not be a few of my deep imagination.
I was in the wild coast of South Africa for about 10 years.
In June and July every year, the group will move to the north to the north, which is called elaborate running.
These fish are the reasons why they have to escape.
They are hunger and they are hunger to the flocks of the flocks.
You will be able to find the following: They make some sardines separated from the master's flocks to the bait lump.
The dolphins are squeezed with fish and squeezed with squeezed fish.
In the back, the shark is chasing.
Many people think that sharks and dolphins are the enemies of the earth, but these two are common in sardines.
In fact, the shark can help you learn more efficiently.
If you don’t have a break, the bait lump is more dispersed and the shark is often filled with the boat that I call the jungle donut. The mouth is full of water.
There were a few times when the sharks and dangerous moments were running, but the shark doesn’t take me.
But in this so-called banquet, I'm going to be like any of them or fit into the tail.
In the coast of Africa, we go across the vast Indian Ocean to the east and go to the Maldives, a military road made of coral reefs.
And while the storm is in the rainy season of the south-west region, the rams of the military are in the rainy season.
It is a weekly eating of the flocks that are not larger than the eyes.
If the flangkton density is reduced, you will feed yourself. Like a puppy that takes the tail of his own, they continue to turn the airfare.
However, if the flangkton density is increased, the rats are covered with these long feeds. And the first and second rams out of the duck, the next rams will be eaten to the duck.
When the flangkton figure in the bay is in the peak, the ratga ducks look at the unusual behavior that we call the sowing to eat and swim near.
And while swimming in the large part of the mounds, the mounds are made by their own hands and sucking the flangkton.
This experience is really unforgettable, surrounded by the mounds.
When I was first photographed, there was no protection and the threat of development.
Working with NGOs like Manta Foundation, my photos were ultimately helpful to change the marine protection area.
On the islands that have been hunted by rats to make a traditional north with a peel
It is now the most intense environmental protection athlete. And the Maldives economy has over 800 million dollars each year of income earned from the march.
I always wanted to travel time to the times that I had used the maps most or "in the map."
And so far, I have been the closest experience to this, and I have been at the external corals of the Indian Ocean.
Diving from the ocean to the fish and the fish are far away from the water, so we will remind you how the sea looks at once.
We’ve heard about Basas da India. It is a small coral island located in the morning of Mozambique.
Corals form an external barrier for protection and internal supervision is the birthplace of Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never slippery even during the day.
I've guessed that the sharks at night are more bold.
I’ve never seen many sharks in one coral reef.
Sharing these moments will remind me why I chose this way.
At the beginning of this year, I went to Barha California with the challenges of the National Geographic magazine.
There is a mountain Ignacio Lagoon from the Pacific side. This is an important birthplace of earrings.
For a hundred years, this coast was a great place to live. More than 20,000 earrings were dead and a few hundred were left.
The descendants of the whales surviving today are pushing the ropes and playing and even flowing.
This species was really amazing return.
There is a kabo full mo, which is a subtle fishing village in the opposite side of this peninsula.
Dozens of men lead to collapse this village.
In 1995, local residents have acquired the authorities and assigned their coast to the Marine Protection District.
But what happened since then came to the miracle.
In 2005, after 10 years of protection, scientists witnessed the recovery of the most large fish in history.
However, don’t believe in the words and go with me.
Let’s swim together with the most magnificent and pristine fish tails of the fish so far.
We can become a creator of hope.
And I would like to convey the lessons that are still hoped for our sea, through my photography.
In particular, I would like to note the healing power of nature facing a population of 73 billion.
My hope is to take pictures like this in the future, but I would like to take photos that show us that the sea respects each other and the public.
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
If you want to survive and thrive as a marine photographer, you must be a great paradise.
I always believe that the great picture of the next will be near. If you’re looking for the next generation of corals, you’ll be able to go to the next level.
When I came to the Harares of Zimbabwe in 1985, the government had a social definition as the core of the National Health Policy.
The new government entered after a long standalone war, and the new government immediately completed socialism policy. Health services, basic education for free.
While the number of health centers in the province has been exploded, 80% of the populations of earthquakes have a great achievement that can be within 2 hours of the health center.
In 1980, only 25% of children were vaccinated.
In the last 1990, the ratio increased by 80%.
I have a great pride in being part of this change and revolution.
I felt a strong excitement and a companion of people.
With great scientists, doctors, and athletes from Zimbabwe, I felt that it was in the field of African independent exercises, and also the field of experiments in the world welfare exercises. But it was also difficult.
1985 I arrived first year,
Zimbabwe’s first AIDS infection cases have been reported.
I had a few questions about AIDS patients, but it was hard to expect a medical resource equivalent in Africa.
Early infection rate was about 2%. It was 17 years from the time that I left the Harares.
It is a great place for one person.
In the middle of 1990, I have given an AIDS proficiency to hundreds of people in the determination of life.
I’ve seen colleagues, friends, students, and patients died.
In response, my colleagues opened the hospital.
We have taught condom usage.
We have conducted training in schools and workplaces.
It was also a research. We are happy to announce that we will be happy to announce that we will be happy to announce that we will be happy to hear from you.
I've been working hard and believe that I've been doing the best at the time.
As a doctor, I treated my patients wonderfully. But there was no claim that the structural change is necessary.
The former UN General Manager Kofi Annan speaks to his mistakes that call the University of Rwanda.
In 1994, he was the President of the UN’s Peace Youth Activities.
In the 10th session of the university, he was congratulated. “I believe that I’ve been doing my best at that time, but I’ve realized that I’ve been able to return back after my university and I’ve been able to know and help. News
Izu has a health system and has a history of 3,900 million lives in the world’s health organization. Now, I feel the congratulations and regrets of unprecedented things.
I didn't take my role as policy support or political participation until it was in Zimbabwe.
I was there as an expert in medical and aesthetics.
I think of my heart, I thought the patient to look and study to understand the prosthetics of the disease better and slow the spread of the disease.
I’ve noticed that the outside layer is exposed to the threat of AIDS.
In the form of sugar farm, which is more closed than any business of modern, 60% of pregnant women have seen the fact that it was infected with HIV.
I’ve been trying to inform the fact that the AIDS infection fact is not a moral compromise, but also the fact that the human rights and the forced labor and the colonization of human rights.
People have low infection rates.
As a health specialist, the tools given to us were very poor. It was also recommended to reduce the change of lifestyle, use of condoms, and unity companions.
Infectious disease continues to rise, and the most potent hopeful treatment was developed in the western side, but it was a flock to supply in the cost-effective Africa. I have caused such a huge tragedy,
I didn’t hear my voice about the problem of unfairness, economic and political systems of accessibility to the treatment. I thought that I would be only a guest of this country, but if I would have been warned of the New Year, I would like to take care of it, and if so, I would not be able to look for more patients or do not know what to do.
So I've been in response to the early response of the government.
I didn't speak full of concerns.
Many doctors, and health experts believe that there are no mistakes.
In the case of a medical device, the medical device will not be used for medical devices.
And I have provided everything that can be tailored to each patient.
But I knew that the disease happens in the cracks of our society. It is not only a biology but has seen a greater impact on social unbalance, foreign and race, sex, class, etc.
Izu was.
Recently, I did the Ebola word.
The medical anthropologist Paul Pammer, who researched AIDS in iTe, is called ‘vibration by structure’. The reason for the structure is due to the fact that our society does not consciously exist in political and economic structures that are indispensable. The reason for violence is because the result is shocking like early death, devotion, disease.
If you don't know this social complaint, the treatment of the patient is only implied.
This is the first step towards public health and how to solve problems and make real change. So today, I'm not quiet.
Even if they are uncomfortable,
Even if he is discomfortable, many things say. Most of the things are similar to an anode or
It is about everyday races. These are the things that are no longer in this country. Especially in medicine, the public health area.
But they have a fragile, and we don’t care about it.
This is the reason for the health of New York as a health authority to warn that the racial discrimination affects the health of the U.S. and the racial discrimination between the nineties and the nineties of the U.S. and the racial discrimination between the nineties, and the abundance of the 60 years. Early Bird Rate in New York, that is the rate of dying before 65
50 percent higher than black people.
In 2012, black women have more than 10 times the risk of dying during childhood women compared to white women.
The black baby, even if the jumbo toddler mortality is reduced, is still closer to three times the risk of dying in the first year compared to the white baby. New York is not exception.
The result of this statistical results were similar to the statistics found throughout the United States.
Recently, New York Times reported that over 150 million black men from across the country are missing. This should be located between 25 and 54 years old
One of the six men of black men suffered in prison or early men, young black men suffered unfair violence in everyday life
#BlackLivesMatterseaTags But we are at the same time
As a result of numerous risk figures and major diseases, diseases such as cardiac disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS should be remembered to slow down the life of these diseases and hearts.

We will deliver the emotions to many people.
The genocologists often wear backs of the scissors, but alternatively, the medical system is silent about the influence of social discrimination on the spread of the disease and the impact of death.
And I’m a modern medicine, personalization that develops biologics or genetically remedy, about fineization medicine, and that’s why these moves are most affected by public health, as we live with side effects, growing, working, and loving everyday stories.
It's time to do everything. As a healthcare professional working in everyday life, we realize tremendous negatives whenever we take care or progress research. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
There was also a feeling of heart. As a healthcare professional, our role is not only to treat patients, but also to warn and promote change.
Our social status is in our words and we should not waste this power.
I’ve been waiting for the work of Zimbabwe, and I’ve noticed that I’m going to be a New York Health Bureau, and I’m not aware of the possible means for health peace. I am against the race,

But nowadays because of the topics like climate change and vaccination exercises... It is also dangerous.
The world we live is the world that all conversations are likely to be developed as a debate, and the politicians don’t talk with each other, and the most suspicious matter is that someone is passionately discussing the cold. About Us
As a result of researching million adult Americans in the Fu Institute, we are the most polarized in the history and have been submerged.
The possibility to compromise is lower. I’m talking about others.
Where are you, and who are married? And whoever is your friend, you decide according to the belief that we already believe.
It is said that it does not move to other words.
Listening and listening should be balanced. But from the endless we lost its balance.
This is the development of technology.
We always keep your smartphone next to your home or at any time.
According to Fu Institute, one of the three American teenagers sent over 100 characters every day.
And when the teens of the majority are chatting with friends and chatting, they’re more to chat with characters.
I've been a fun post on the monthly continent
Paul Vanwell wrote a high school teacher.

We’ve made a challenge to tell me in the instantaneously without writing on the notes.
and halfwell seeds speak
“I realized that the technology of conversation is the most appreciated and without teaching.”
Children communicate through screen every few hours daily, but there is no chance to wipe conversation skills between people and people.
I don't know how to ask yourself, but let's ask yourself. Is it important to be more important than logical and self-directed conversations during the 21st century?
I'm working with people. Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, kindergarten teacher national won, piping...
I’m talking about people who like, I don’t like.
You can also chat with people who are not able to directly agree
I'm a good conversation.
So I will tell you how to speak to you for 10 minutes.
Many people have already heard of this advice. For example, if you’re talking about your eyes, you’ll notice that you’re talking about an interesting topic, and you’ll see that you’re listening to laughtering and focusing. Don’t just say you’re talking about or summarized.
All these tips are forgotten to Mozart.
This is the sound of the dog.
I don't need to learn to know how to listen to if you're a real focus.

We’ve had a great conversation. I've seen before, I know what good conversation is. Become a immersive, inspired
I think I'm real, and I think I'm perfect.
There is no way to say that most conversations you do. 10 basic rules. We will tell you more about it, even if you’re one of these
You can enjoy a lot of good conversations
First, you should not do several things at one time. Cell phone, tablet, car key or anything on hand
I'm not going to go down.
We’re here for you.

Do not think of such things. If you want to finish your conversation, don’t focus on your conversation.
Second, do not preach.
If you don’t want to express your opinion only, please write it on your blog if you don’t want to respond, debate, or grow.
This is the reason why I’m in the show that I’m boring.
If you are conservative, don't like Obamana, welfare, or abortion
If you’re in progress, don’t like large banks, refinery companies and thieves.
It's perfect.
You should not be.
We’re here to help you get started with your conversation.
M. Scott Peck, a famous psychotherapist, was a true listener.
This means that it is also when you need to download personal feedback.
According to his words, it is more and more weaker if it feels that I hear is acceptable.
Let’s say again, but think you’re learning.
Bill Age: "All you meet know what you don't know."
If you want to explain the words, everyone is a professional in any field.
Third, please feel free to answer.
This is the way you write.
Get started with a question.
= If you have a complex question, you will get a simple answer.
If I asked "Done?"
You’ll respond to the most intense words in that question, “Yes” or “Yes”.
"I've been angry?" "Yes, I've been very excited."
If you have any questions, please contact us directly. You know that your feelings are self.
"How was it?" or "What did you feel?"

That’s what you’re answering, and you’ll have to do more interesting answers.
Fourth, follow the flow of conversation.
When you leave your mind, you will need to keep in mind.
Some interviews are when the guest talks a few minutes, and when the socialist suddenly broke, or asks already answered questions.
It means that there is a very sharp question to the socialist, and it’s only time to ask questions to ask for more than two minutes before.
We do the same actions.
When someone sits and talks, suddenly reminds him that he met Hu Jackman in a coffee shop.
Then we stop listening.
Any topic or thoughts will leave.
I'm sure I'm going to shed.
5th, do not know.
"I'm sure I'm not sure that I'm a professional in this field."
Please be careful that you can pass through.
The conversation should not be blurred.
6th, do not make your experience the same as other experiences.
Who talks about the death of the family and do not talk when you lose your family.
Don’t complain about your work if you’re working hard.
I'm not like absolutely.
All experiences are different.
No matter what, you’re not centered.
I don't need to be self-propelled or peculiar.
Who asked Stephen Hawking how many IQs were asked, "Make. IQ is a man who is proud."
The conversation is not an opportunity to be proud of.
7th, do not say. I'm really grateful. But we are often.
In particular, if there is a point that you want to say when you talk with your child, you will be repunished.
Don't.
8th, do not close the details.
I’m not interested in the exact year or name, the date and details you’re trying to remember. You are interested in.
If you are a person, you need to worry about what is common.
I'm sorry. = I don’t know.
It is not the last but the most important.
About Us
Many great people say that they are probably the most important thing you can develop. "If you're open, you're not learning."
“There is no one that has been done by many.”
Why do we not listen?
First, because we want to say.
When I say, I will control the conversation.
= I am not interested in.
I am interested
to enhance my identity.
But there are other reasons. 뺴
People say about 225 words per minute, but you can listen up to 500 words per minute.
That’s why I’m going to fill the rest 275 words.
About Us We have a lot of effort and energy to focus on others. But if not concentrated, not to talk
There is only a sentence that does not matter in the same space.
We have to listen to each other's words.
Stephen Cubby speaks,
“We’re trying to understand and listen to the answer.”
Finally, speak short.
'Good conversation is miniskirt. It’s as short as it keeps interesting and as long as it deals with topics.’ - My brother is one of the basic principles of all these things. I am interested in this other.
I was a kind of consciousness in the house as I grew under the famous grandpa.

So I thought that everyone has a hidden amazing point.
I think it is a good socialist thanks to that idea.
We do not open the mind without opening the maximum mouth, and we will never be ready to be surprised at any time.
Please do so.
Let’s talk about people and listen to and prepare for amazing things.
About Us
Thank you.
My name is Matthew Williams. And I'm a champion.
I have obtained several medals from three different species of sports in Canada and competed at the international level basketball competition and represented Canada on the world stage.
I have a weekly basketball and speed skating training. We strive to become the best of our seedlings with the best coaching and spirit and expertise.
All this is possible through special Olympics.
Have you ever changed your thoughts about my and my achievements?
The world does not care for everyone like me.
It’s just a few days ago, people like me have to be a paradigm and be a daunting.
After the special Olympics start in 1968, there were different changes, but in most cases, the intellectual disability is like transparent interpersonal for many people.
People in front of the 'an' word, they are not aware of.
The word is used as an vocabulary or as a vocabulary to vocabulary people.
They do not think that these words are a great wound to me and my friends.
I don't think I'm here for my purpose.
The reason I came here is because many people still have a big problem with the point of view of the intellectual disabilities, or if too many, they don’t know them.
Did you know that there was a World Tournament this year?
I’ve been one of over 6,500 intellectual disability players from 165 countries gathered to participate in special Olympics in LA, and
With more than 62,000 audiences, TSN and ESPN channels were also available.
Did you know that this happened?
What do you think about the same person?
Today, in this place, please look at people who are equal to us.
Special Olympics change the self-esteem of intellectual obstacle players
You can also change the viewpoints of all of them. For those who do not know well,
Special Olympics are tournaments for intellectual obstacle players.
This is an Olympic and Paralympic Games. We set up the quality of life and people's sight for intellectual obstacles players
This exercise was not only my life but also changed the life of many others. And the world's intellectual disability
You can also change the view line.
I was born with brain failure and intellectual failure.
I've been hockey until 12 years old. The larger, the more difficult to follow the levels of different children, answered and angry.
No exercise for a while. No friends, no other and sad.
When the person who is in charge of intellectual disability in society, it was.
Nobody did not know that they would be exercised, and they did not know that they would be a valuable person in society.
Dr. Frank Hayden, one scientist at Toronto University in the 1960s, has been researching the impact of general exercises in intellectual disabilities children’s health.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers with thorough scientific research concluded that intellectual disability children have fallen health levels in the lack of opportunities to participate in the exercise.
Many people have suspected that many health programs or athletic competitions are great for intellectual disabilities.
But the founder of the Hayden and the special Olympics, the Unis Kennedy Shriper won’t hit as a pioneer, and the special Olympic players have proved that they were right.
Before joining a special Olympics, I was a lot of anxiety. It is because it was a little bit bad, no confidence and no friend.
However, at the moment of standing on the stage, everyone encouraged me, and supported me, and helped me to be my own, regardless of the other's trial.
I’m now a basketball player and speed skating player. It was the first player in the history of Canada as the first player in the World Games Competition.
I’m one of the world’s more than 450 million athletes, but I’ve heard a lot of similar stories.
Become a special Olympic player to restore our pride and pride.
In addition, special Olympics will also cover important health desires.
According to many research results, averagely pointed disability men die earlier than normal men, and pointed disability women die for 20 years or more earlier than ordinary women.
Special Olympics continue to move us and engage in movement to help us healthy.
We also teach you about nutrition and health.
In addition, special Olympics offer free health checks for athletes who are unable to communicate with doctors and doctors.
In the Hagye Olympics in 2015, my Canadian colleagues and I have been playing with the Nigerian Basketball Team.
On the day of the match, the Nigerian representative team attended the World Games Championship athlete’s health check-in, and seven of the ten players were able to listen to the first time in life.
The change that comes to them was enormous.
They were more gods, happy, and were yourself. Because we could communicate with the directors and words.
I'm sorry. The sound of the basketball ball is heard and the sound of the horror is heard, and the cheering sound of the spectacle is heard -- We are too busy because of this sounds.
Special Olympics are not to change players only in one subject.
Changes to their life outside the stadium.
According to many studies this year, half of the adult population in the U.S. may be pointed to the point of view, and 44% of the U.S. people who do not have intellectual disability and personal connection were much less respected.
There's also a word 'an'. The people who do not know yet will be a transparent person.
People write this word as a light word and write it as a desire.
Last year, this word was mentioned in Twitter over 900 million times, and it’s a very big wound to the colleagues around the world.
There are many things to say that it will not be confusing but not.
John Franklyn Stevens, a co-worker and global messenger, answered the political experts who wrote the word ''. "The first special Olympics come together with us.
Let’s see if your heart is unchanged. "" ""
In this year, in the Hagye Olympics in 2015, people stood a line to see the finals for a few hours.
In the end it was only an granular, and a proud discreet 297kg dread lifted up 277kg in the squat posture. It was the best record in special Olympic history.
Jaki is the top recorder owner of all the reverse lines of Newfoundland. Not only in the special Olympics, but also all the players say.
Ashki was a huge star in LA, and ESPN updated his record in real time on Twitter and didn’t dare for his game.
50 years ago, there were many people who believe that intellectual disability is to do such things.
This year, six million spectators of the LA memorycraft Coliseum saw the opening ceremony of the World Games, and cheering numerous players from 165 countries around the world.
cheering is big, we are cheering, and received a celebration.
Special Olympics teach players to be confident and confident.
Special Olympics teach world-famous people who are pointed to respect and are members of our society.
I’m now dreaming in my subject, it’s achievement, and great coaches are also revealed, respect and self-esteem, and much healthier. Now, we are working to become a private trainer.
I'm going to talk about the TED lectures without being hidden or playing.
The world has changed a lot thanks to special Olympics, but it is still a long journey.
So, let’s see his talent at the moment you meet the intellectual disability.
If someone around you at the next time writes the word 'an', then let's tell you how big it is.
You can also participate in special Olympics.
Finally, let's say more.
Nelson Mandela says, “Sport has the power to change the world.”
Special Olympics are changing the world. With 450 million players changing, we have a place where we can stand more confidently, and we’ll meet your friends and enjoy the Champ’s mood and become a champion.
About Us
You may not enter any of the following questions:
But I know that two of them are the most promising place in the earth.
The hospitals in that place are quietly located in the community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who are across the most critical threats of humanity. Lasa virus.
Lasa virus is very vulnerable with Ebola.
It is also a very sympathy, and it is also a very sympathy.
They also have their lives every day to protect them in this place, and to protect all of us.
However, when I visited the first place in a few years ago, the most important thing I learned about them is that they start singing the day in the hardest forefront.
They gather together and share joy
show their pitch.
And for many years, when I visited them or when they visited me, we gather together and sing together and enjoy them. Because we are here to pursue science, we will tell you that it is a sticky humanity that we share together with the country.
As you think, such a process is very important and has become an essential element even when there is something change.
And in March 2014, when the Ebola occurrence was declared, many things were changed.
This was the first shot in Western Africa. It was near Sierra Leone and Liberian border.
And it was very scary, We’ve all been afraid.
We’ve actually been undoubtedly spread over Rasawa Ebola’s thoughts, which day I’ve come to Kerama.
So, the members of the first research team were immediately dispatched and joined the feasible doctor and his team, and they prepared a precision molecular diagnosis to help Evaluate if Ebola entered the border beyond the Sierra Leone.
We have already built this system for the rasa virus, so we knew how to cope. The team is very jumping.
We have provided tools and venues for surveys to these
And it's not, that day is coming.
On May 23, 2014, some women were enrolled with hospital obstetrics, and the team members performed important molecular diagnostics to confirm the case of the first embola of Sierra Leone.
This was really great.
They were able to immediately diagnose this case, to start a contactor tracking survey to safely treat patients and make sure what happened.
I'm going to stop something.
But when the day came, Ebol was already busy for a few months.
Many cases have already surpassed the disease in the past.
And not one case in Sierra Leone, I've entered the same day.
We’ve been doing many cases with international community and health and kinoma, and we’ve been the only place to deal with in Sierra Leone, following a week of 31 cases: 92, then 147 cases, and all of them come to Kerama.
And we do everything we can do throughout the 24 hours, and we’ve helped people, and we’ve been trying to get attention, but we’ve been one simple task.
In order to discover Ebola, the patient's blood is obtained from the sample. Of course, you can not waste the sample.
What we can do is to deactivate the chemical immediately, put it in the box and go across the sea, and we did so.
My team spent it as a Boston.
We’ve been working every day without rest, And I’ve made 99 Ebola Virus Genomes.
This was a blueprint. genome blueprint of viruses.
We are all about.
We will tell you about everything we make, and we will tell you the number of information.
The results of these experiments are very simple and influenced.
We had such 99 different viruses and could compare them. and could know. It’s actually a comparison of three genomes that have been devoted in Guinea. In a few months ago, we can show that we have been desolate to mankind, infiltrating to mankind.
This is very important. How to open In order to know what to do, but more important than that was a contactor tracking survey.
We’ve seen that the virus is transformed by people.
And each mutant was very important, because many diagnostics and vaccines, the treatment we used is light, because all of them were based on the gene sequence that moves the virus fundamentally.
So, global health experts have responded to this, develop and remedy everything they did.
However, in the location that I was at that point, the way science works is collecting data, working in the insulating room for a number of months, suggesting a paper that will be published by very careful and slowly, and the data will be distributed when the paper was published.
This is how the current situation works.
But what does it work? About Us
We’ve been friends on the mission and we’ve helped us to make a lot of help.
So we’ve been the first time, genetic sequences were published on the web as soon as they were confirmed in the machine.
“I’m going to see you.”
And I'm going to help.
Before we know, we’ve been in touch with people around the world, and we’ve been surprised to see public data.
A very bold virus tracker has been together with our community at any moment.
We’ve been working together in a virtual way. Share, regular phone call, communication, etc. I've been looking for different ways to stop viruses in time.
There are many ways to create these communities.
In particular, when the disease occurs spread around the world, all of them were able to learn about disease, participate, and grow their hands to engage.
I wanted to play both.
The amount of human capacity indicated here is very amazing. And the Internet connected all of us.
“We’ll do this instead of we’re in the fear of each other.
Let's work together." Can you imagine that he said?
But the problem was in the material we all used. Googleing on the web was a limit to what we do to do.
And if such things happen, you can miss many opportunities.
In the early stages of the kinema, we have 106 patient clinical records and we have again revealed this world.
And in our laboratory, we have been able to train computers so that you can access 106 records and predict an example of Ebola patients 100 points
We also created the app to deploy it so that the medical staff on the site can use it.
However, the number of 106 was not about to be strong and recognized.
So we are waiting for more materials to distribute
They are still not coming.
We are still waiting in the insulating room and are improving. I'm working together.
And these facts are that we cannot accept.
About Us We cannot accept all of you.
Our life is great.
And in fact, many lives lost. Many medical staffs, including my beloved colleagues, 5 colleagues: Emberru Pony, Alex Moigboy, Juan Khan, Alice Covoma and Mohammed Pula.
These are five of the number of medical staffs These are those hidden outside of Kerama and other places. When the world is waiting, all of us are working, quietly, away.
There are many reasons why it is not to be difficult to find out about the threats of humanity, dispersion and dispersion.
If we build a barrier to grind each other, and fight each other, the virus will thrive.
But unlike all things that threatens humanity, we are all of the same human places to be seen right.
We all have this fight together.
One family of Ebola diseases can be our moment.
So here I have the same vulnerabilities, such as strength, fear, and hope that we can work together with a happy mind.
One of the first graduate students read books about Sierra Leone and found that the word "Kenema", which is the city that we worked in the hospital and Sierra Leone, was originated from the mendian word "It is clean, transparent and open in the sight of the public."
It was amazing all of us. We always felt before we know. In order to cope with the people of Kerama, we have to work together, share and work together.
and so on.
We all need to ask ourselves and others. When the disease occurs, you need to open your mind and fight together.
This is because it is not the first occurrence of Ebola. And the last is not. Many microorganisms are waiting outside. There are lots of rasa viruses.
And when this happens next time, you can get up to thousands of cities.
It may be a bottle that is prefectured with air.
It is also possible to put it into the height.
It also knows that it is a fearful thing, but it also knows, and this experience shows us the skills and ability to win this. This is the best way to the virus.
But we can only be together And it should be with a nice mind.
So for the candies, and always with us for many of these victims in the forefront of this fight, always let them together in this fight.
We do not define the world that is destroyed by viruses, and let us shine by billions of minds and thoughts.
