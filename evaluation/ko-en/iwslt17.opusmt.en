This is how we know what we know.
This is a story about this woman, Natalia Rifchinski.
She's a paleontologist, so she's an expert at digging out dead things very long ago.
Natalia Lefczynski: I also call you "Dr. Dead."
And what I'm interested in is where she digs things, she works in remote Canada's tundra far above the Arctic Circle.
One summer day in 2006, she was at the site of an excavation called Fyles Leaf Bed, which is not 10 degrees above the north pole.
Natalia: It wasn't a big deal, because I've been walking around all day with GPS and laptops and everything that looks like a fossil.
Latif: And at some point she realizes something.
Natalia: It was rusted, rust-like color, about the size of my palm.
I was just lying on the ground.
At first I thought she was just a piece of wood, because people had discovered pre-history plant fossils before.
But that night, when I came back to camp,
Natalia: I took out a portable magnifying glass and looked at it a little bit closer and realized that it didn't look like there was a ring.
I thought, maybe it's something that needs to be preserved.
It looked like a bone.
So over the course of four years, she went on to explore the area, and eventually collected 30 pieces of the same bone, most of which was really small pieces.
Natalia: It's not a big deal.
Latif: And she tried to set the bones like a puzzle.
But it was very difficult.
Natalia: I've used sand and glue because it's so much sculptured.
So in the end, I took a 3D scanner.
Latif: Oh! Natalia:
Latif: It was actually a much easier way to do it.
Natalia: It was magic to make the pieces one.
Latif: How sure were you that these pieces got together right?
Was there any possibility that you were not well-assembly, or small parakeets or other bones?
Natalia: Well, no. No, we did it right.
According to her, what she found was a skull, a leg bone, and, exactly, a half-legged mammal's leg bone, an animal like a cow or a sheep.
But it couldn't have been these two animals.
Because the bones were too big.
Natalia: It was really big. It was the bones of a very large animal.
Latif: So what are they like?
In the process, she showed one piece to a colleague in Colorado and they gave her a good opinion.
Natalia: We saw to pieces at the end, and there was a really interesting smell in that gap.
Latif: It was like a burning smell.
It was the smell that she used to smell when she went to class in the disgusting anatomy class, which was the smell of chloragen.
It's a bone structurer.
And it usually collapses over time.
But in this case, the North Pole was preserved by its natural freezing and dynamic.
And then, a year or two later, at a conference in Bristol, Natalia saw a colleague of hers, Mike Buckley, demonstrate "Collagen Fingers."
The idea is that different species have a slightly different collagen structure, so if you have a callagen structure here, you can compare it to the structure of the discovered species, and maybe find a match.
So she sent one piece to her colleague, the Peedex.
Natalia: Yeah, I'm going to do a shipping check. It's important.
And he analyzed it and compared it to 37 known species of mammals.
We found a match.
Research has shown that this bone is a skeleton of 3.5 million years ago, and the owner of this bone that Natalia dug out of the Arctic Circle...
It was a camel.
Natalia: I was like, what? That's amazing -- if it's true.
Latif: So we ran tests with different pieces, and the results were all the same.
But according to the size of the bones found, this camel was found to be 30 percent larger than the modern camel.
And this camel is nine feet tall and weighs about one ton.
Yes.
Natalia found the giant Arctic camel.
Now, this is what you've heard when you heard the word camel: the Cape camel of East Asia, Central Asia,
In your head, you may have this camel that's normally found in postcards, which is a typical desert animal that lives in hot desert areas, in the Middle East, in the Sahara, and has a big lump on its back, storing water for long desert treads and crossing the sand dunes with large, wide feet.
So how did they get to the Arctic Circle?
Well, scientists have known for a long time that before the discovery of Natalia, the camel actually came from the United States.
And here was the first camel.
It turns out that about 40 to 45 million years ago, the first camels were found, and only in North America, there were 20 or more species.
Latif: Can you tell the difference if you compare the whole camel?
Natalia: Yeah, they're not the same size as each other.
Some of them have very long necks, and they're actually giraffes.
Latif: What species has crocodiles?
Natalia: The primitive camel was really, really small, almost like a rabbit.
Latif: What? A rabbit-sized camel?
Natalia: Four-time camelga.
Maybe it's not a camel.
Latif: Oh my God, I'd like to have a rabbit camel.
Natalia: Me, too. Don't you think?
And about three to seven million years ago, one camel, which evolved into Rama and alpaca, passes through the Bering River to Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the ice age, the North American camel is extinct.
Scientists knew all of this, but they didn't fully explain what Natalia had found in the north.
In temperature, for example, the polar regions are completely opposed to the Sahara.
Just to be clear, 3.5 million years ago, on average, it was 20 degrees warmer than it is today.
So the Arctic Circle would have been just like Yukon or Siberia today.
But it was a place where the winter lasted for six months, and the water pool frozen, and the water pool was frozen.
That's where the snowstorm happened.
It would have been an area of polarism that lasted 24 hours.
How... how?
How did this Sahara superstar survive in the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her colleagues come up with a hypothesis.
And it was a pretty ingenious idea.
What if what we think camels can adapt to in places like the Sahara is actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the camel's broad feet were not to cross the desert, but to walk over the snow?
What if the camel's hump -- it's a big news to me -- is it not water, it's fat, and it helps you through the six months of winter when you don't have enough to eat?
And what if later, when the camel crossed the Bering Bridge and later converted these characteristics for wintering into a hot desert environment?
For example, it's going to be helpful to the hot climate on your back, because you've got a bunch of fat in your body that's like a fatty bag, so you don't need insulation around your body.
The hump on your back makes it easier to block the heat.
It sounds strange, but the essential reasons for the camel's survival in the desert are the evidence that it used to live in the Arctic Circle.
In fact, I'm not the first to tell this story.
Others see this as the wonder of evolutionary biology or the key to climate change in the future.
But the reason I like this story is different.
I think it's about us, and I think it's about how we see the world and how it changes.
I'm a historian.
And I came to realize that a lot of scientists are like historians.
The proof of the past is the same thing.
Scientists talk about the life of the universe, of the Earth, of the Earth.
And as a historian, I thought about where this story would go.
Natalie: We make a hypothesis, we think it's true, like a camel lives in a desert, don't we?
It's a perfect story! I totally believed it.
As you can see, camels live in the desert.
But at some point, when you discover a very small piece of evidence,
Everything you've ever known in that little thing can be turned upside down.
In this case, a scientist discovered a piece of wood that he thought was wood, and that gave science a completely new and counterintuitive theory of why this animal looks like Dr. Sussus.
And for me, the idea of a camel was completely distorted.
In fact, it's not weird anywhere in the world.
He's a great man.
How are you feeling?
Here, take one of these.
I'm just taking a break from my regular performance at the Radio City Music Hall.
I'm not kidding.
Anyway -- and the reason why that makes sense is to show that the story of the world is mechanical.
It's something that we need to adapt to and imagine again.
Isn't that right?
And actually, a little piece of bone has transformed the world that we see.
Thank you.
Today's computers are so amazing that it's hard to see how horrible they are at the same time.
I'm going to show you today the problems of computers, and I'm going to show you how to solve this with neuroscience.
First, I'm going to tell you an important event that happened to me on a cold night in Harlem in 2011.
I was sitting in a bar outside of Columbia University, where I majored in computer science and neuroscience, and I was in a bar and I was in a conversation that my friend and I were going to replace the computer one day.
And at the height of our conversation, my friend's phone rang.
He pulled his phone down and he looked down and started typing.
And I raised my eyes hard and looked at me and said, "Go on, I'm listening."
But there was no heat in his eyes, and the moment was already cold.
Meanwhile, on the other side, the other student was pulling out his phone and throwing it out to the group.
He was handing over photos of Instagram, and he was laughing with the group.
I was fascinated by the fact that my moods were hurt and that my happiness was due to the same technology.
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the content of the digital information didn't bring different results, but it just separated me and my friends from the screen, and the more connected they were.
They're stuck in a cell phone, as if the ancients had raised their social skills by sitting around a campfire and talking.
I think tools should function like this.
It has to be an extension of the body.
And I think computers today are the opposite.
Whether you email your wife, write a symphony, or comfort your friend, it's similar on your computer.
You encounter the squares, you touch the buttons, you touch the menu, and you bring in another square.
I think it's wrong. I think we can use a much more natural machine.
We need to use machines that do things in the real world.
We need to apply the neuroscience principles to machines that are not working against our senses, that are expanding our senses.
There's that machine right here.
This is meta 2.
Let me write that down.
I can clearly see my hands with the audience in front of me.
On the count of three, two, and one, there's a realistic hologram in front of me right now, in a very realistic hologram form, right in front of the device that I'm using right now.
It's not just the product that we're shopping for, it's also the subject of exploration, and it can use our hands to move with precision.
Iron Man is going to be proud of it.
I'll see you in a second.
If you're like me, you're imagining what's possible with this technology, so I'll show you.
And my mother is an architect, and naturally, I thought of it as a 3D representation of architecture, not as a blueprint for 2D as it is today.
She touches graphics, she selects internal decorations.
This is an actual video from Meta 2.
The next example is something that I can relate to, and this is Adam Jail's transparent brain project, which I got from UCSF.
As a science student, I always imagined machines helping me to learn and memorize complex brain structures, touching complex brain structures, and playing around with them.
But I'm going to go further, and I think, with the help of machines, we're going to expand our body's capabilities, not vice versa.
Now...
In a few years, humanity will have made a big change.
We're going to start building a layer of digital information that corresponds to the real world.
Imagine what a change this will make: storytellers, painters, brain surgeons, indoor decorators, for us here.
And I think we're all united, and we're talking about how to create this new reality through lots of attempts and efforts, and we're trying to figure out how to expand our human experience, not just to make it like a game, or to fill it with information.
And I'm very passionate about this.
Now, let me tell you a little secret.
In about five years, this is not a minimalized device, it's going to be developed in a thin glass belt that projects a hologram in the eye in about five years, and just as we choose an operating system rather than a hardware when we buy a cell phone, I always dream of making an iOS for the mind.
The development of the OS needs to be very careful, because as long as we use the Windows, we can live in the new OS.
I don't know about you, but I'm afraid to live in the Windows.
To find the most intuitive interface for the user, we're putting neuroscience at the heart of the design, and you can't see it coming from the conference room.
The principle that we always come back to when we're designing is to find "the least effective neural circuitry."
In every step, we're trying to connect the iOS of the mind to the intuition of the brain, in other words, we're trying to create a computer that doesn't need an explanation.
We're building a computer that we instinctively can use.
The next three design guidelines are for a new user experience.
This is what we're looking for.
You are an operating system.
The existing file system is not complicated and intuitive, it forces extra understanding into your brain.
So you don't go through a circuit that has the least sense of performance.
On the other hand, in augmented reality, you can put a holographic TED screen here, an e-mail on the other side, and use the real space to pull a hologram.
You can pull out the Tesla car that you were shopping for, because before the talk, the justice team had agreed to use it.
OK, the brain completely understands this process.
The second guideline is what we call "touched".
What do babies do when something attracts their attention?
I'm going to reach out and touch them.
That's how natural machines work.
It turns out that in order for a visual system to work, you have to feel self-receptive, where your body is.
So if you can touch it yourself, it's not just the convenience of manipulation, it's the ability to understand the content more deeply.
You touch it and you see it.
But it's not enough to be alone.
We're social animals.
This is our third guideline, the holographic campfire that we're talking about.
By means of mirror neurons in the human body, we can engage in doing things with other people by looking at their faces and their hands with 3D.
If you look at the video behind me, two meta users play together in the same hologram, and they interact with each other, not because of the device.
With the neuroscience in mind, I'm going to use the device again.
I'm back to iOS for the mind.
I'm going to go further and grab this device by hand and put it next to my desk.
I'm with you. I'm connected.
I can grab this device and put it back in place, because I'm an operating system myself.
Now, as the self-receptive senses work, I can break this device down into thousands of parts and touch the sensor that's scanning my hand.
But it's hard to watch alone, so I'm going to talk to my co-founder, Ray, on a 3D call.
Ray, how have you been?
All of you, I'm looking at this guy in front of me as 3D.
like it's real.
Thank you.
My mirror neuron says it's going to replace the phone in near-sighted.
Ray, how are you?
Yeah, we're live.
Ray, give this audience the first hologram brain you've ever seen.
All of you, this device will change not only the phone, but the way we work together.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ray.
No problem.
So, this is the message I found at the bar in 2011, and the future of computers is not locked up in a square screen.
It's right here, it's in the cage.
What I can tell you today is that the natural machine is not a science fiction of the future, it's in 2016.
Meta has already created this device, so hundreds of meta administrations, managers, designers, engineers will abandon all the monitors in the company by TED2017 and turn them into truly, truly natural machines.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
Chris Anderson:
Each time, among the engineers, there was a debate as to whether the demonstration scene was actually a user's view.
It's about the angle of vision, and it doesn't look much broader than what you actually see as a device.
Is that what you see in the video?
MT: It's just the way it is.
And not only that, but with a lot of adjustments, we did a camera scan of everything in the lens.
When I looked at the video, I put a ball into the film to give the experience of actually using the device.
CA: Thank you very much for your consideration.
Thank you very much. That's rewarding.
I'm from Seattle, Washington, the most liberal, generous, progressive country in the United States.
I grew up in a family that believed that Seattle was the best.
My mother was an artist, my father was a university professor, and I was so grateful for the upbringing that I was able to build my life comfortably.
But in fact, I didn't follow the way my parents wanted me to.
I was 19 years old when I dropped out of college, and I was kicked out, and I was a pain in the ass.
I went to see Professor Franz Horn, who I had dreamed of.
I played indoor music in the United States and Europe, and I traveled for two years with a wonderful jazz guitarist named Charlie Bud.
By the end of my 20s, I had become a single member of the Symphony orchestra in Barcelona, Spain.
That's a great life.
My parents never complained.
He gave me all his support.
It wasn't what they wanted.
My parents used to say to neighbors and friends, "My son is in a space."
And there was a little uncomfortable conversation about my life, and I want to talk to you about it.
I came back from Barcelona when I was 27 years old, and it was Christmas, so I went to visit my parents, and I was cooking in the kitchen with my mother.
She was so quiet.
Something was wrong.
I said to my mother, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
And he said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
And I said, "Well, what should I do now?"
She said, "I really want you to tell me everything: have you ever voted for a Republican?"
Yeah, actually, I was just a French horn player who wasn't interested in politics.
But my parents noticed what was going on, and there was some confusion.
I became an ardent supporter of capitalism, and I'll tell you why.
It's due to poverty, which is my lifetime's interest.
I remember when I first grew up in Seattle and I saw poverty.
We were a little below the middle class, but we weren't poor.
I couldn't get anywhere near it.
I first saw the reality of poverty in the early 1970s when I was six or seven years old.
I was just a normal kid.
I saw pictures of a child my age from East Africa in National Geographic magazine, and his face was full of flies and his abdomen was expanding.
I knew he wouldn't survive.
Some of you may remember that picture, even if it's not one of them.
It's about showing the world's endless poverty in the West.
That picture bothered me until I was old enough to go to school, quit school, went back in, built a family.
And what would have happened to him?
I wondered what would happen to those people all over the world.
So I started studying even though I wasn't in college, looking for answers: what's going to happen to the poorest people in the world?
Is it worse or better?
I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I'll share it with you.
Look -- most Americans believe that poverty is worse than it was in their childhood.
If Americans were asked, "Has the world's poverty gone bad?" 70 percent of people would say that hunger was worse than early 1970.
But the truth is,
It changed my mind.
Since 1970, the weight of hunger in the world for less than a dollar a day has been reduced by 80 percent by applying inflation.
Since I was a child, poverty in the world has been down 80 percent.
I didn't even know.
It's a miracle.
It's something we should celebrate.
It's the best record of poverty in the history of mankind, and it's happening in this age that we live in.
And when I discovered that, I wondered, how? How could it have been done?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If we knew why, we could save two million other poor people from poverty, and that's our theme: at least two billion people have been out of poverty since I was a little kid.
I want the other two billion to do the same.
looking for answers.
Not a political solution that I don't care about.
Still, I'm not interested in politics.
looking for answers in every aspect of the economy.
The answer is this.
Let's see why.
There are five reasons why two billion people have been able to escape poverty.
First: Globalization.
Number two: free trade.
Number three: The Right to Poverty
Number four: Laws.
Number five: Startup.
The big free business system that made that possible spread around the world in the 1970s.
It's not naive.
It's not perfect, but it's not all we need to make a better world.
But that's a good thing.
It's not political.
Here's what I learned. This is a revelation.
Capitalism doesn't just talk about accumulation.
It's about the best of it, the satire, which many people on this stage have said is that it comes out of a dream and it's in a free enterprise.
You have to share it with more people.
I tell you the second story, because I think it's going to improve both the family and the world.
My favorite quote is what I've said about saving people from poverty: "Free Market has created the biggest wealth in history."
They took away a billion people's poverty.
Who said this?
It's like Milton Freedman or Ronald Reagan.
No, it is not.
That's what President Obama said.
How would I remember?
He told me.
Crazy.
I said "Hallelujah."
But I also said, "That's an opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
There was an event in May 2015 at the University of Georgetown where we played as the main character.
And I think that's what's going on in America today, in terms of the biggest problem that's facing it.
What was the answer, with this idea of progress and pay, to the people who needed us the most?
I'm not trying to tell you that we're in crisis, that the United States and the rest of the world are in trouble with political polarization.
We're reaching a crisis.
It's not good. It's not right.
I had an article last year in the National Academy of of Sciences, which is one of the prestigious scientific journals in the West.
And this is an article in 2014 about political imbalances.
What is it that psychologists believe that their ideas are based on love, and that the opposite is based on hate?
The answer is common conflict.
You can see it in Palestine and in Israel.
The author of this article found that most Republicans and Democrats in the United States today suffer political imbalance.
Today, political activists believe that their motives are strong and the opposition is hate.
Think about it.
A lot of people walk around and say, "You know, my ideas are out of mercy, and I want to help others, but others are evil and hinder me."
We're not going to be able to develop those disproportionate groups.
It's impossible.
How do we solve this?
Let's be honest: there's a difference.
You can minimize the difference: pure.
We need a lot of research.
This is Jonathan Hyde, the TED stage veteran.
He's a psychology professor at New York University.
He explores people's ideas, values, morality to see differences.
For example, Jonathan Hart said that liberals care 59 percent more about poverty than they care about economic freedom.
And conservatives care 28 percent more about economic freedom than they care about poverty.
It's an impossible car, isn't it?
It's wrong.
And that diversity is what makes it rich.
Remember what destroyed poverty.
The solution to economic freedom and the obsession with poverty spread around the world.
In other words, we need each other.
There's no other way.
Hmm.
What do you want me to do?
It's tricky.
We need innovative ideas.
There's a lot of these things.
Social entrepreneurship. Yeah, it's obvious. It's amazing.
We need foreign investment in sustainable, responsible, ethical, moral ways.
You know what's most important?
We need a flexible accident.
We have to be less predictable.
Isn't that right?
Don't you think that our ideas have been predictable ever since?
It's a platitude.
Don't you always feel like you're listening to someone who's sympathetic to you?
Why is that dangerous?
We're talking about the economy in this country, and we're talking about taxes and regulations and governments in a conservative way.
And the liberals talk about income imbalances in the economy.
Right? It's important. It's important to me and to you.
But if you think of a hungry person, that's just a distraction.
In order to destroy poverty in the best way, we need the conservatives to make progress, to understand the liberals' obsession with poverty, to understand the liberals' need for conservatives, to understand the free markets.
That's the diversity that will make this country stronger, if we do it.
How do we do that? How do we do that together?
There's an action needle for you and me.
Number one: the first action check: remember, it's not enough to be patient with those who oppose you.
It's not just that.
We also need to know that we need people who are different, because they are the ones who need our solution.
What are you going to do? How are you going to do that?
Where do we start? Right here.
All of us here are blessed.
There's people listening to us.
We've been blessed with prosperity, we've been blessed with leadership.
When people hear our stories about unpredictable ideas, they'll probably listen.
From there, progress begins.
That's the first one.
Number two: I ask you and myself if you can be that vague and difficult to explain that will break the line of difference.
If you're a conservative, you're a hero of the poor and you're always a conservative talking about poverty and moral obligation.
And if you're a progressive, you're left with the progressives who are discussing the benefits of the free market to solve the problem.
And we have two benefits.
One: we're going to solve the next two billion problems, and we're going to see the solutions we've seen in the past in the future.
And secondly, we can turn the conflict of ideology that this country is experiencing into a competition of thought through mutual respect.
And maybe you'll see that the difference isn't that big.
Thank you.
When I was in college, I majored in politics, so I had a lot of homework to write.
And the average student will kind of scatter things like this when they're doing their homework.
You know, it starts a little bit slower at first, but if you do it as much as you can in the first week, you'll end up doing it more later, and it's all organized.
That's what I want to do.
That's how they plan it.
It's all done, but in fact, when the assignment comes, this is what happens.
This is what happened to every single assignment.
I came up with a 90-page graduation paper that I had to invest in for a year.
I knew I shouldn't do this kind of thing the way I used to do it.
It's too important to do that.
So I made a plan, and I thought, well, here's what I'm going to do.
You spend a year like this.
It's starting to tick, it's starting to speed up a little bit in the middle, and at the end, it's just a little bit of energy, like a little staircase.
How hard would it be to climb the stairs?
It's nothing, isn't it?
But something really funny happened.
The first few months,
It was just over time and I didn't do much.
So I made a great plan correction.
And then the middle month went by, and I didn't write anything, so this is what happened.
Two months became one month, and that was another two weeks.
And then one day I woke up, and I had only three days left, and I did what I could, and I wrote 90 pages, not a day, but two nights, and human beings can spend two nights, and you can't do that, and you can't do that.
I thought it was over.
But a week later, the school called.
"Are you Tim Erbun?"
I said, "Yes."
"I need to talk to you about papers."
I said, "Do it."
It's like, "That's the best paper I've ever seen."
It never happened.
It was a very, very bad paper.
I just wanted to enjoy the moment when you think, "This guy's great!"
No, no, it was terrible.
Anyway, I'm now a blog writer.
I run a blog called "Wait, why?"
A few years ago, I was going to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always upset people who don't put off doing things around them, and I wanted to explain to them, why we put off what's going on in the head of the person who's putting off the job.
I had a hypothesis that people who put off their job had brains that were different from other people's brains.
In order to verify this, I found an MRI lab, I had it scan my brain, scan the brain of an untested person, and compare them.
I'm here to show you today.
See if you can see the difference.
It doesn't seem very clear that you're not a trained brain specialist, but please take a look.
This is the brain of someone who doesn't put it off.
Now...
This is my brain.
There's a difference.
They both have "reasonable decision makers", but in the delayed brain, there's "sparely satisfied monkey."
What does this mean for people who put off doing what they're supposed to do?
That means everything's fine until this happens.
The reasonable decision maker will make a reasonable decision to do productive work, but the monkey doesn't like it, so he grabs the wheel and says, "Let's read all the Wikipedia pages of Nancy Kerigan and Tony Harding scandals, and let's go to the refrigerator and see if there's anything new.
And then you go to YouTube and you start with a video of Richard Feynman explaining magnets, and then you spend the last time you're interviewing Justin Bieber's mom.
This all takes a lot of time, so I don't have time for anything today.
I'm sorry!"
What's going on?
A little satisfied monkey isn't the kind of guy you want to catch on the wheel.
He only lives in the moment of the present.
We don't have past memories, we don't have knowledge of the future, we only care about two things: easy, fun.
In the animal kingdom, it's going to be fine.
If you're a puppy and you spend your life doing things that are easy and fun, it's a success!
To this monkey, man is just another species of animal.
You just have to sleep well, eat well, reproduce well, and that's enough in tribal times.
You know, it's not tribal anymore.
It's the age of advanced civilization, and monkeys don't know what it is.
So there's another part of our brain, which is the rational decision maker, which gives us the ability to do things that animals can't do.
You can dream of the future.
You can see the big picture.
We can make long-term plans.
The reasonable decision maker is going to take this all into account.
Now, they want to make sure that they're doing reasonable things.
Sometimes it's appropriate to eat dinner, or sleep, or have a good leisure time, so there's a overlap.
Sometimes they're right about each other.
But sometimes it's much more reasonable to do things without having to be difficult and enjoyable to do them for greater meaning.
And that's when the conflict arises.
For those who put off work, that conflict always ends in the same way that they spend a lot of time in this orange land, an easy and fun kingdom outside of a reasonable kingdom.
I call it "dark playground."
The dark playground is a place that everybody who's putting off work knows very well.
It's a place where leisure activities happen, and sometimes you shouldn't be doing recreation.
The fun in dark playgrounds isn't really fun, because they don't deserve to play, and the air is full of guilt, fear, anxiety, self-control, and everybody's putting it off.
The problem is, in this situation, how are the monkeys going to keep up with the blue, where the less enjoyable but important things happen?
Fortunately for those who put things off, there's a guardian angel, who always looks down at him and protects him in the darkest moments, and he's a panic monster.
The panic monster is dormant most of the time, but the deadline suddenly wakes up when it's coming forward, when it's publicly embarrassed, when there's a disaster in its career, or when there's a terrible danger of a second.
What's important is that it's the only thing they're afraid of.
Until recently, he was very close to me because he called me up six months ago at TED and invited me to give a talk.
Of course, I said yes.
I always wanted to give a TED Talk.
But I'm excited, and I think the rational decision maker had a different idea.
He said, "You know what we took?
Do you really understand what's going to happen one day in the future?
You have to sit down right now and start."
And the monkey says, "I agree, but now, just open Google Earth and zoom in on the south end of India to get better acquainted with India, and scroll up for two and a half hours, from 200 feet above sea level to the north end of India."
So that day I did it.
Six months went to four months, two months, one month, and a TED speaker came out.
I opened the website and I saw my face staring straight at me.
And who woke up?
So, the panic monster starts to unwind, and a few seconds later, the whole system goes off.
And then the monkey, who's afraid of the panic troll, runs away on a salty tree!
And finally, a reasonable decision maker was able to take the lead in the talk.
The panic monster describes the behavior of the real people who put off their job, how in two weeks, people like me who can't even put on the first sentence of a task, are miraculously looking for work ethics and spending eight pages in the middle of the night.
This whole situation is described as three people, and this is the system of those who put things off.
It's not a very good shape, but it's finally working.
So a few years ago, I wrote a blog about this.
When I wrote, people's reactions were amazing.
literally thousands of e-mails were sent by various people around the world who did a lot of different things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and lots of Ph.D. students.
They all said the same thing, "I have the same problem."
But what surprised me was that the blog was a light note, and the email was a very serious contrast.
These people were very frustrated about what life was like because they were really putting things off, and what the monkey had done to them.
And I was looking at this, and I thought, why is it that the system of people who put things off works?
Why are all these people in the dark?
It turns out there were two kinds of procrastinators.
In the example I gave you today, there was a deadline.
Procrastination is limited to a short period of time, because panic monsters are involved.
But the second kind of procrastination occurs when there's no time.
If you want to engage in self-business, such as art and business, you don't have a deadline, because nothing happens until you step up to work, and there's a lot of other important things that don't take place at all.
If you're a panic monster, that's the only thing that's going to make you do these difficult things, because there's no deadline for all of this, and you don't wake up.
So the consequences of procrastination are not limited, they just go on forever.
It's ridiculously short-term, it's much less visible than the kind that has a deadline, and it doesn't get discussed, usually quietly, by itself.
This could be the source of a lot of long-term misery and regret, and I think people emailed me.
That's why they're in a very bad situation, and it's not because they hit the task.
It's like long-term procrastination makes you feel like
Sometimes it's because it makes you feel like a viewer in your own life, and it's not because you don't realize what you're dreaming about.
So, when I read these emails, and I got a little bit of insight, I don't think there's anyone who doesn't put it off.
That's right. You're all procrastinators.
Well, you may not be as messed up as we are, but remember, the monkey's clever deception comes when there's no time.
And I want to show you one last thing.
I call this the life calendar.
Every week in 90 years, there's one box.
We don't have a lot of boxes, especially since we've already used a lot of boxes.
I think we need to look at this calendar very carefully for a long time.
We just have to think about what we're putting off, because everybody's putting off something in life.
You have to be conscious of the monkey for a moment.
That's what we all have to do.
You don't have a lot of boxes left in your calendar, so you're probably going to have to start today.
Well, not today.
Well, it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's... it's...
Sooner or later.
Thank you.
That day we were having the last day of our lives, the souls and bodies of the Texas Church.
It's similar to this room, but there's an old red cloth on the wooden chair, and the organ was on my left and the choir was behind me, and the baptism bath was on the wall behind the choir.
It was like here, though.
Like here, there was tension, there was hope for salvation, there was sweat in the hand, and the people in the back were not paying attention.
It was December 31, 1999, and I knew it was the end of the world.
I was 12 that year, and I felt responsible.
And as soon as I was old enough to be responsible for what I did, I thought it would be better to stop complaining about Jesus coming back and clean up the house very quickly.
So I went to church as often as I could.
I listened as hard as people would listen to sound, to be sure that God didn't take me first, and I decided to go home early.
Even if Jesus came back, I read the then popular ones and prepared an alternative.
The book says that I have a chance not to get into the ecstasy of the second coming at midnight.
To do this, I had to avoid receiving the mark of the beast and fight the devil and the plague and the Antichrist.
It would have been difficult, but I believed I could.
But it's time to plan.
The clock pointed to 11:50.
Ten minutes until the return, and he called us out to the chair to the foundation, because he wanted to pray when midnight came.
So the faithful were all gathered together.
The choir stayed at the choir, and the priest and his wives, as I'd like to call them, sat at the front of the foundation.
There's also a VIP seat in the United States on the day of Jesus' second coming.
And right behind the Baptist bourbon, there were the divinities of the hot sun on the cotton farm in eastern Texas, and their unblinked brown skin was burned like mud in East Texas, and their dreams and hopes for life outside of East Texas were sometimes bent and shattered rather than their crooked waist.
These older men were the characters of the day for me.
They've been waiting their entire lives for this moment, just as medieval ancestors looked forward to the end of the world, and as my grandmother waits for Oprah Winfrey Shaw to do on channel eight every day at four o'clock.
When she went to the foundation, I stood behind her, and I was sure to believe that she was going to go to heaven, and when I held her hand in prayer, she said,
I thought I could come with you, so I took my hand and closed my eyes to listen and wait.
The prayer has grown and the cry of answer to prayer has grown.
It was getting louder and louder.
I was adding an organ to it.
The heat added to the sweat.
I grabbed my hand and tried not to leave it alone.
I tried to close my eyes more tightly and not see people fall away.
And the voice went out over them as they prayed, "Amen."
It's over.
I look at the clock.
It's already past midnight.
I looked at the elders, their saviors didn't come, they didn't reveal their disappointments, but they began to doubt that they had believed too much and too long.
I was angry when I saw them in their shoes.
They've been fooled, they've been blinded, and I've been right next to them.
I prayed for them and tried not to be tempted.
I put my head twice, not once, in that croaking baptist bath.
I really believed in it.
So what do we do now?
When I came home and turned on the TV, I could see Peter Jennings declaring a new millennium as he passed around the world.
And the sudden thought was that it's strange that Jesus would go around the world and come back in time.
This made me more ridiculous, and it really hurt me.
But I didn't lose faith in it that day.
I just started to believe in something new, that it's possible not to believe.
The answer I have could have been wrong or the problem itself could have been wrong.
And once a mountain of confidence came down to that source, a fountain of doubt, a spring of promise of a river.
I remember vividly the night when my savior didn't appear in the church, the day when I learned what I believed most was that it wasn't true, even if it wasn't false.
Most of you will have received Y2K in a different way, but I'm sure that part of you have experienced the same thing since the beginning of the new millennium when my mother left and my father disappeared and my savior didn't show up.
I'm holding hands, and I'm looking for a place to lean.
I entered Yale at the age of 18, the faith that I had raised in Oak Cliff Texas, and I had the opportunity to get behind a lot of tests, a lot of body and a broken heart that I had been through.
But when I came home at a winter vacation, what I found was my face on the ground, my hands tied behind my back, my gun of robbers pointed to my head, and I realized that I couldn't be saved in much of my study.
I also had faith in Liman Brothers, who worked as an intern in 2008.
I was so hopeful that I called my family and told them that we wouldn't be poor anymore.
But when I saw this temple of finance collapse in front of me, I knew I couldn't be saved from the best jobs.
I worked as a young employee in Washington, D.C., and I had faith because I heard in Illinois, "It was very hard to get here, but this election is going to change America."
But when the National Assembly failed to function and the whole country came to an end, I realized that hope and change made me feel like a cruel joke, and that the return of political saviors couldn't save me.
I kneeled at the altar of American Dream and prayed to the god of this time to succeed in the God of Money.
But I kept waking up in the middle of the night and seeing that all these gods were dead.
In despair, I started looking again, not because I was brave, but because I knew I was standing at a crossroads between believing and dying.
So I went on a pilgrimage to another shrine, to Harvard Business School, and I knew I couldn't just accept the salvation that I claimed to be true this time.
But I knew I had more work to do.
It started in the dark corner of a big party with three miserable Cambridge friends and me in the late night of the early winter, and there was this question that young people who were looking for the truth had been asking, "Why don't we take a ride?"
We didn't know where to go, but we had to go.
Because we've been longing for a life like Jack Keroak's novel, where it's gone, and we've been trying to figure out how people live across the country.
So other people said the risks were too great and the evidence was weak, but anyway, we left.
In the summer of 2013, we traveled 8,000 miles across the United States across Montana, across the moors of Detroit, across the swamps of New Orleans, and worked with people there, who were working on the foundation lines of life through the fishing industry.
And I was shocked by this innovation, because I was bitten by western capitalism.
And this idea grew to become a non-profit foundation called MBA's Acrus America, a movement that I've created to stand here today.
This movement has spread because our generation has a deep longing for purpose and meaning.
It's a movement where a lot of entrepreneurs are creating jobs and changing their lives, and they need a little help.
But to be honest with you, this movement has spread because I've been fighting.
I was going to go anywhere to spread this gospel so more people would believe that we could sew this torn country together as a social enterprise.
But the journey to spread this gospel has brought me to another gospel that I want to share with you today.
About a year ago, at the Natural History Museum in New York, there was an agency at Harvard Business School.
There was a real-sized whale model down there, and I sat down with the giants of our time, and they were celebrating their work with their colleagues.
It was full of pride, because the net assets and property that were run under the management were over 500 billion dollars.
It was great to see what we had accomplished together.
But something else happened two days later, and I went to Harlem to spread the gospel, where I sat on a once empty city farm, and I heard Tony talk to me about every day of the kids coming out there.
These kids were all living in extreme poverty.
A lot of kids carry everything in their bags so they don't lose it in homeless shelters.
Some of them get into Tony's Harlem Grounds and solve the only meal of the day.
Tony says he's starting to lose his pension for Harlem Graham, who's been driving a taxi for 20 years.
He said that the reason he dropped the pension was because the program was successful, but he needed support.
He was willing to accept any help.
And I helped them.
But as I broke up with Tony, I felt my eyes tickled and my eyes filled with tears.
I felt the weight of a sign that one day I was in a room with hundreds of people who had 500 billion dollars, and two days later I was looking at someone trying to feed their child by giving up their pension, just 50 blocks from the other room.
I didn't shed tears because of obvious inequality, and I didn't shed tears at the thought of hungry children floating on the road, not the rage of the top one percent or the compassion of the other 99 percent.
I was hurt because I realized that I was nothing more than a dialysis machine in this country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that I was replacing people who had no boots, who were being urged to tie boots, and I felt that my organization had replaced the structural support of Harlem, Appalachian, and New Orleans with people who had no place to live and who had no place to live.
And the shame began to come, the same thing that Peter Jennings felt when he sat in front of the TV and called again and again for a new millennium.
I was deceived, I was blinded, I was confused.
But this time the false savior was me.
If you look, I've walked all the way from that altar on the night that I thought the world would end, where people's suffering is a necessary act of God, and the words in the Bible are absolutely true.
Yes, I went all the way around and back where I started.
Because we can't just say that we live in an age of distrust, and today we believe as many people as we had before.
Some of us believe in Brenet Brown or Tony Robbins' prophecy.
Some of us may believe in New Yorkers or Harvard Business Review as the Bible does.
When we gather here at the TED church to raise our prayers, we can trust them the most deeply, but we have to believe and we have to believe.
We promise to solve all our problems like charismatic leaders.
Pain is seen as a necessary evil of capitalism that we believe in and as an inexorable truth in the development of technology.
And we know very little about the human cost of not having this little question, because we're afraid that we're going to shake the whole foundation.
But it's time for you to have a question if you're hurt by the absurdity that we've come to accept.
I'm not talking about collapse, reform, or the gospel of new corporate measuring principles.
I'm not actually here today to preach the gospel of faith to you.
I'm here to spread the gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt is not telling you not to believe, but to believe in something new, that it's possible not to believe.
The answers we have can be wrong or the people who believe in them can be wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt is that all of us here can be wrong.
Because this gospel raises the question, "Why?"
The question we raised our hands with with all our heart, why do people still have to suffer like this?
This doubt closed down the MBA's Across America, the organization that I run.
We're going to send our employees away, we're going to close the doors, we're going to share our business model for free so that anyone who has the ability to do this can do it without our permission.
This led some people to give up the role of the Savior that I've given up on, because our lives are too short and unlikely to wait for the Savior's return, in fact, when there's no miracle in the world.
And this doubt will empower me and give me hope that when we are surrounded by anxiety, when the path that lay before us seems to lead us to the end, when our healers can no longer heal our wounds, our modest doubts will become a little light in our lives and in the darkness of this world, and we will be able to raise our voices and whisper our voices, our voices, our voices, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts, our thoughts.
It's going to make you shout or simply say, "There's got to be another way."
Thank you.
Food Shortages
It's in the news every day.
What's the problem?
There's too much food in the world, but there's too much.
Where is GMO saving the world?
Maybe GMO is the problem?
Too much agricultural waste pollutes the oceans.
The cycle goes on.
And when you look at this, it's very difficult.
How do you feel about this on your skin?
How is this apple food?
You may have had an apple recently.
How long do you think it's been since I picked this apple?
Two weeks?
Two months?
The average age of apples sold in the American market.
It's not going to be much different in any part of the world, and then you put a chemical in there, and there's real cases of death, because chemicals used in the process that slows apples down are harmful to the human body.
Why didn't I know?
When we eat this apple, we lose about 90 percent of the nutrients, including antioxidase.
This apple is just a bunch of sugar.
How do we get so little information here? How do we get better at it?
What we lack is a platform.
The platform and the computer connected me to the Internet when I was a kid.
I've done a lot of weird things on this platform, and I've been able to meet people and express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a platform, we could ask autonomously, what if?
I asked this question: what if the climate is equal?
This is a map of the global climate.
The most productive areas are green and the other areas are red.
The climate changes. California farmers are now Mexican farmers.
China wants to buy Brazil's land and grow good food, and we rely heavily on climate.
What if all countries could have the best climate?
How do we change our lives?
How will it affect the quality of life and the quality of food?
The previous generation of food shortages was cheaper and needed more food.
Welcome to the international farm.
We built a big analog farm.
The lines shown above are the transport routes of cars, airplanes, trains, etc.
It's a miracle that only a very small fraction of society can engage in agriculture and feed seven billion people.
But if...
What if we built a digital international farm?
What if we could digitize this apple and transfer it into the air and reconstruct it on the other side of the planet?
What if?
The quote that I'm going to introduce inspires me in what I do.
The first: Japanese agriculture has no water, no land, no young blood, no future."
Young people headed for Sendai and Tokyo, where the land is polluted and food is about 70 percent foreign.
But this is not confined to Japan.
Only two percent of the United States are involved in agriculture.
How can two percent of the population do anything about it?
50 percent of Africa's population is under 18 years of age.
80% don't want to be farmers.
Farming is hard.
Life is miserable for small farmers.
Young people move into cities.
In India, members of the farm family are not guaranteed at the least, and in the last 10 years, the rate of suicide among farmers is higher than ever.
It's an uncomfortable truth to put into your mouth.
Where are people headed?
It's a city.
There are no young people in the farmhouse.
How do we make this platform move young people?
New tractor.
It's my harvest season.
A few years ago, I started making things that I heard on the Beath and Beyond and Home Depot.
I've made stupid objects, I've got plants dancing, I've connected them to my computer, I've killed them all many times.
And then I had the most intimate relationship in my life with plants, because I was learning their language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
"There's an old electronics room that nobody wants.
Take advantage of it."
I built a farm in there with my team, in a place that had nothing to do with biology, in this 183 square meters.
It's not that much, but it's produced a certain amount of food for 300 people every month, and there are some interesting technologies on it, and it's a lot of fun.
What's the most interesting part?
It's beautiful, white-rooted, dark-green I Paris, and it's only a month's harvest cycle.
Is this the new cafeteria?
Is it a new retail experience?
A new supermarket?
One thing I can say is that the media lab people, for the first time, took something from it.
It's not that weird because you're just eating a salad in a bag.
If you're taking root with video-based processing experts and data scientists and robotics, you're going to think, "Well, maybe I can do something about this.
And then we took some plants back to the lab, because what you grew is precious and you can't do it.
I've come to have a delicate taste, because I want my plants to be delicious.
Because every day you eat lettuce before everyone else, and now the taste alone allows you to get your pH into a range of 0.1.
"This one has 6.1. I can't eat today."
It was very sweet.
Because it's stressed and it has a chemical reaction to protect itself, and it says, "I'm not going to die!"
The resistance of plants to live only feels sweet to me.
Instead of relying on the latest technology, we went back to plant physiology.
We thought that other people should be able to do this.
I want to see infinite imagination, so I've managed to launch a research lab that can be shipped anywhere.
This media lab is the front of my lab, and I use 30 sensors per plant.
If you know about genomes or genetics, that's what the penoms are, right?
One phenomenon.
If you're saying, "I like Mexican berries," it's even more accurate to say that berries grown in that climate are good.
If you can code the climate, then this is just the right prescription for CO2, O2, which is the nutrition and climate, the size and shape of the plant you want to grow, and the color and texture.
We need data to analyze what's going on, so we have a lot of sensors attached.
"Why are you dying? Why can't you speak?"
You're going to be sad, and the farmer will have the eyes of the most beautiful prophet.
When they enter their 60s and 70s, they can't just look at the plant that's growing, but they can't see whether it's nitrogen deficiency or calcium deficiency.
We can see if we need more humidity.
That wisdom is not being followed.
This is the new eye of the cloud environment.
We're looking for patterns of data over time, and we're looking for connections to individual plants.
These are all the IP addresses of all the Broccolis that I've provided for the Biffe Me.
Now we have a time when we have IP addresses.
If you're more prepared to be surprised, you can click and see the profile of that plant.
But it's not just about when it's ripe.
I don't know if I've achieved the nutritional conditions I want.
I don't know when I'm going to get the taste I want.
I don't know if you're getting too much water.
I don't know if you're getting too much sunlight.
They're warning me about all of this. They're talking to me.
We had our own language.
Could it be the first user on Facebook? It's going to start making friends.
I mean, that plant will be friends with plants that need less nitrogen and potassium but need more phosphorus.
Now, we're going to learn about complex connections that we can only guess about, depending on how we do it, we're going to change the outcome.
This is what my lab is now.
Now we have a little bit of a system, and I know a little bit about the controlled environment because of my career in designing the medical data center.
So we're doing a lot of experiments in this environment.
And this distribution process was developed by NASA to reduce the water sent to the Mir Space Station.
In this process, the plants can provide what they want in the right place: water, mineral resources, and oxygen.
The root isn't that picky. When it's satisfied, it's a beautiful response.
It's like having two hearts.
So it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect environment.
We've been developing seeds that overcome adverse conditions for a long time, and the effort will continue, but we also have a new weapon called an inadequacies, which we've tried.
It's not been grown commercially for 150 years.
Do you know of a seed bank that holds all kinds of seeds?
Seed Bank
It's an amazing place.
There's a lot of procreatives that are preserved there, and there's a lot that we've never had before.
I'm the only person in this room who's ever eaten such tomatoes.
The problem is that this tomato is for sauce, and we can't cook, and we've eaten it as a vehicle, and it's just like that.
We've also developed a lot of different things through protein modifications.
And of course, it wasn't.
In the course of the experiment, we realized that this device was too big and expensive.
It cost about 100,000 dollars per unit to put it in different parts of the world.
There's not a lot of people who can spend 100,000 dollars at any time, so I wanted to make it smaller.
In fact, this project is from my graduate student who's majoring in mechanical engineering, and so throughout the summer, Camille and my team wondered how they could make cheaper and more efficient products easier.
And we put this in many schools in the seventh or 11th grade.
Teach your children to feel humble.
I asked one of the students, "Feed the humidity to 65%."
I went to the seventh grader, and I said, "What's humidity?"
"The humidity is the water in the air."
"There can't be water in the air, Mr. Fabulous."
So I advised him, "Yes, don't trust me."
What else can you trust me for?
Set the humidity to 100.
What happened when she changed her settings?
The gas condenses, the steam gets cold, and finally the water drops off.
And he says, "Oh, that's the humidity."
"Why didn't you tell me that?"
The interfaces we've created are similar to online games.
Users can access 3D environments anywhere in the world, even on smartphones and tablets.
The user controls the physical environment and sensors in this machine garden.
You can choose how other kids grow around the world.
And then they activate the grower and they plant the seeds.
The seeds can change while they're growing.
"Why does he need carbon dioxide? Isn't it bad for him to kill people?"
They can raise CO2 levels to kill plants.
You can lower the levels and make the plants grow well.
Once you grow plants, you're going to have a new digital farming system.
This process is a series of development and explorations, and users are the ones that they're producing, and they're the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones that are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are the ones who are
We can download digital farming and data, and we can compare it to what it's done before, and it's all just beginning, and we're going to learn a lot.
This is the food computer.
They've grown up.
But more importantly, I've given him the first idea that I can be a farmer, or I want to be a farmer.
We're open-sourced all of this.
It's all open on the web, so try making it on time.
It's not going to be easy.
We just started.
It's very important to me that everyone can participate more easily.
It's going to make it easier.
The electronics engineers, the engineering engineers, the environmental engineers, the computer scientists, plant scientists, economists, city designers.
They do what they do well on one platform.
And then they got too big.
This is the new facility that I've just started.
You can install them anywhere in the world.
That's why I chose this method.
In this warehouse, we're going to build something like this.
These things already exist.
These things already exist.
The first is that plants
The second facility grows the Ebola vaccine.
Darpa Grand Challenge, and the plants you just saw, are one of the reasons why humans are ahead of the Ebola virus.
They're producing proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
Pharmaceuticals, Medicines, and Stilts.
As if they're completely different from each other in my field,
Everything is different.
It's on the edge of "Is this good enough?" -- there's a little wandering, and they're boasting about their products, and they're saying, "I've got a very expensive intellectual property.
Buy what's mine."
But the reality is that we just started.
It's also a time when society is changing rapidly.
Now we need good green food, and it's not strange if we go up to the top of the world's most mysterious food.
It's a time when we were advertising what McDonald's Chickens and Magnats are made of, and everything's changing.
From now on,
It's a private food computer server and a food data center that works with open paper.
What does it look like when you add climate-generated farming, like Wikipedia, and what does it look like in society?
Do you remember this diagram that I showed you earlier?
In the future, there's going to be a point instead of a line.
It's not the delivery of food itself.
It's not just my imagination.
It's already in the direction of humanity: food computers, servers,
And the food data center is going to connect people, because they're not going to be able to do anything about it, and they're not going to be able to do anything about it.
It's not the future of food that blames each other.
We already know what's wrong.
The future of food supply is to connect the next generation of farmers to the platform, empowering them to ask each other questions.
Thank you.
Sometimes I'm really ashamed of myself as a European.
Last year, millions of people arrived in Europe who needed our help, and our response, frankly, was pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Curdy, but then more than 200 children were drowned in the Mediterranean.
We have an international treaty that recognizes refugees as a joint responsibility, and yet we have accepted that the small Lebanon embraces more Syrians than all European countries.
We mourn the existence of human smugglers, but we're making it the only way to be able to escape to Europe.
We're suffering a labor shortage, but we're blocking people from coming to Europe who need the economy and the population.
We claim the value of freedom in the face of Islamic fundamentalism, but we have a repressive policy to arrest children who want asylum, separate children from their families, and confiscate the property of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did things get so far? Why do we face humanitarian crisis so inhumanely?
I don't think people are interested, or at least I don't want to believe it.
I think it's because we politicians don't have a vision, we don't have a vision of how to change the global refugee system that was created over 50 years ago and how to apply it to the globalized world.
So what I want to do is step back and ask two very fundamental questions that we all need to answer.
First of all, why is the current system not working?
Second, what do we need to do to modify this system?
The modern refugee system was built in the aftermath of World War II by these people.
The basic goal of this is to ensure that if the country fails, if it turns its back on its own people, people will have a place to go and live in security and dignity until they can get home.
It's designed for conditions like Syria today.
Through an international agreement signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Convention on Refugees and the United Nations Refugee Organization, the International Organization, have decided to share their territories with people who have been devastated by physical conflicts and abuses.
But today the system has failed.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to request asylum.
In fact, our immigration policy is blocking the way to safety.
Theoretically, refugees have the right to be accepted or to return to their country.
But actually, they're stuck in a state of endless uncertainty.
Theoretically, refugees are the responsibility of a global community.
In fact, population statistics show that countries that are close to conflict zones are overwhelmingly accepting the majority of world refugees.
This system is not broken by rules.
And that's what we're going to have to rethink.
So I'm going to tell you a little bit about how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
I'm going to talk about it from a refugee's point of view, not an institutional perspective.
Consider a Syrian woman.
I'll call her Amira.
Ami is a symbol of a lot of people that I've met in that part of the world.
Amy is a woman who has a child like about 25 percent of the world's refugees, and she can't go home because she's from this city, and as you can see from the screen, the beautiful, historic city of Homs is now covered in rubble.
So she can't go back.
But Amy can't hope to be resettled into Third World countries, because it's a lottery that's allowed under 1 percent of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face almost impossible choices.
They have three choices.
The first choice is to take your family to the camp.
You might get help in the camp, but there's very little hope of Amira and his family.
The camps are in desolate, arid, almost desert areas.
In the Zatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear the sound of shells across the Syrian border in the middle of the night.
Economic activity is limited.
The quality of education is low.
And about 80 percent of the refugees living in camps around the world have to stay there for at least five years.
It's a miserable life, and only 9 percent of the Syrians actually choose the camp.
Instead, Ami can go to neighboring urban areas like Arman and Beirut.
This is how 75 percent of Syrian refugees have already been selected.
But there's also tremendous difficulties.
Most refugees don't have the right to work in those urban areas.
There's no particular way to get help.
So Amira and her family spend all the money they have, and they're faced with a life of very little or no poverty.
So there's a third alternative, which many Syrians recently have chosen.
Amy can risk her life on a very dangerous and difficult journey to another country for her family, and that's what we see in Europe today.
The whole world is driven by three choices that are almost impossible for refugees: camp life, urban poverty, and dangerous travel.
For refugees, the choice is today a global refugee relief.
But I think that's the wrong choice.
I think we need to rethink this choice.
The reason we limit choices is because we think they're the only ways that refugees can choose, but they're not.
Politicians define this as a zero-sum issue, which means that if you benefit the refugees, you're going to pay for them.
We think of refugees as the inevitable cost, or burden of society.
But it's not. They can contribute.
So what I'd like to argue is that there is a way to expand the choice of refugees and benefit all of them, both for the refugee countries and for the organizations and for our society and for the refugees.
And what I'd like to suggest is four ways to change paradigms for refugees.
These four ways have one thing in common: they're all taking advantage of globalization, mobility, market opportunities, and they're changing our minds about the refugee problem.
The first thing I want you to think about is the providing environment, and it starts with the basic perception that refugees are people like us, just people who are in a special environment.
I've been working with my colleague in Oxford on a research project that monitors the economic lives of refugees in Uganda.
We chose Uganda not because it represented the nation of acceptance.
Uganda is an exception.
Unlike most of the world's countries, what Uganda has done is provide economic opportunities for refugees.
I gave them the right to work, and I gave them the freedom to agree.
And the result was tremendous for both the refugees and the society.
In the capital city of Kampala, we saw that 21 percent of the refugees were in a business where they were hiring other people, 40 percent of the employees were Ugandans.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs for the citizens of those countries.
Even in the camps, we found an exceptional case of businesses that were active and thriving entrepreneurs.
So, for example, we saw an example of a Congo refugee who runs a digital music business in a settlement called Nakibeil.
And one Rwandan refugee was running a business where children could play computer games on recycled TV and game consoles.
In the face of extreme constraints, the refugees were innovating, and this gentleman in front of you was a Congolese called Demoke, and he said,
They wanted to be filmmakers, even though they came to the colony with almost empty hands.
So I started a neighborhood radio company with friends and colleagues, and I borrowed a video camera, and now I'm making a movie.
He created two documentaries for our team, and he made a successful business with almost nothing.
This is an example of how we can change our response to refugees.
We need to give refugees the opportunity to thrive as human beings, not just to rely on humanitarian aid.
Of course, clothing, blankets, shelter, food are all very important elements in an emergency situation, but we need to look beyond that.
You have to give them a chance: connection, electricity, education, right to work, capital and finance.
Everything we take for granted in the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second thing I want to discuss is economic territory.
Unfortunately, not all the countries of the world are doing the same thing.
The majority of the countries are not opening up the economy to refugees.
But there's still a practical alternative that we can choose.
Last April, I visited Jordan with my colleague, Paul Coriller, while I was there, with the development economist, with the international community and the government, supporting Jordan's national development strategy to provide jobs for the Syrians.
The idea is about economic territory, where you can potentially integrate the employment of refugees and accepting countries, Jordan.
The home of 83,000 refugees just 15 minutes from the Zatari refugee camp is an existing economic area called the King Hussen bin Taral development area.
The government spent more than 100 million dollars building electrical networks, building road networks, but two things weren't enough, it was labor access and internal investment.
What if the refugees had been able to work there, to support their families and acquire their skills through vocational training rather than stay in the camp, until they returned to Syria?
It's going to benefit Jordan, because Jordan's development strategy is to make it into a middle-class country.
It not only benefits refugees, but also contributes to the restoration of Syria after the conflict, through the realization that we have to hold refugees as the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this idea in a diplomatic journal.
King Abdullah adopted our idea.
It was released at the Syrian Conference in London two weeks ago, and this summer's trial is scheduled.
The third idea I'd like to propose to you is to match national and private preferences with the happy results of this picture of Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the Syrian refugees here.
We rarely ask refugees what we want to do, where we want to go, but I have to ask them, and I'm going to argue that they can all benefit.
Alvin Ross, who's an economist, developed a match market idea, which is how you end up with a match.
My colleagues, Will Jones and Alex Titelboy, have studied the idea that it can apply to refugees, so that they can rank their preferred destinations for refugees, and sell it to countries based on technology and language standards.
Of course, there's a certain degree of acceptance of diversity or vulnerability here, but it's still a way to increase the likelihood of matching.
The idea of matching is used in many places, for example, to match students and college districts, to match kidney implants and patients, and it's applied to algorithms on the Daying website.
What if we could apply this to the critical choice of refugees?
It can be done at the national level, of course, in persuading communities to accept the great challenges that we face.
And for example, at that moment in our country, we often send engineers and farmers to rural and urban areas, which is ridiculous.
So market matching is a way for everyone to ask for a preference, and a potential way for accepting countries, of course, to meet the needs and needs of refugees.
The fourth thing I want to tell you about is humane visas.
Most of the tragedies and chaos that we see in Europe can be prevented.
It's based on a fundamental contradiction of European asylum policy, which is, to be safe in Europe, you have to be willing to board this very dangerous journey.
But why do we have to travel like this, in this age of flight and modern projections?
It's a really unnecessary journey, and over 3,000 people lost their lives on European borders and European territories last year.
If the refugees could travel directly to Europe and find asylum, we could avoid it, we could do something about what's called the Indian Bizarro, people could get visas from the embassy or the neighboring constable and buy ships and airlines to go to Europe.
To go from Turkey to Greece through a smuggler, you have to pay 1,000 euros.
It takes 200 euros to go from the boardroom to the Frankfurt.
Allowing refugees to do that would be a clear advantage.
You can save lives, you can limit the market for smugglers, you can eliminate the chaos that you see on the front lines of Europe, like the Greek island.
What prevents us from doing so is politics, not rational solutions.
And here's an idea that's been applied.
Brazil introduced a pioneering approach, a humanitarian visa for 2,000 Syrians, allowing them to enter Brazil and give them refugee status.
Because of this system, all Syrians have gained the status of refugees and have been recognized as refugees.
There's a historical precedent for this.
Between 1922 and 1942, Nansen passports were used for travel, 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens could travel to Europe, and they received refugee status everywhere in Europe.
And Nansen's International Refugee Organization received the Nobel Peace Prize for a practical strategy.
So the four ideas that I've been talking about are how we can increase amira's choices.
It's a way to give more options to refugees, and as I said, three choices that are too basic and almost impossible to make, to benefit everyone.
In conclusion, we really need a new perspective, a vision that increases the choice of refugees, a vision that doesn't need to be recognized as a burden.
When you look at refugees at cost, everything is possible.
Of course, they're humane responsibilities, but they're people with skills, talents, inspiration, and ability to contribute, if they help us do that.
The state of the new world doesn't leave forever.
What we see in Europe will not last long.
People will continue to travel, and we'll find a new settlement, and we'll find a reasonable and realistic way of doing this, not based on the old theory of humanitarian support, but on the idea of creating opportunities, globalization, markets, mobility.
I'd like to argue that all of you and politicians should rise up against this challenge.
Thank you very much.
As a child, I used to dream about the ocean.
It was a wild world full of colors and life, and it was home to strange fantastic creatures.
I took a picture of a big shark ruling the food chain, and I saw graceful sea turtles dancing across coral reefs.
As a marine biologist and photographer, I spent most of my career searching for the fantastic places I had dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I've experienced the water world since I was pretty young.
I was only 10 when I first went to the deep sea.
I still remember all the way back to the old, hard cannons on the coral reefs.
When I finally got the cannon in my hand, I looked up and realized that it was surrounded by colorful rainbow-colored fish.
That day I fell in love with the sea.
After 40 years on this planet, I've had the great privilege of working for National Geographic and the Three Hours Foundation and exploring the most beautiful oceanscapes.
I've photographed thousands of creatures, from very, very, very large sharks to those that fit into the palm of their hands.
The cold waters in front of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest smelled the breezy breath of the blue whale that ate in front of me.
We also saw the mating rites of the blue sea turtles in the Mozambican Channel.
Everyone on this planet is affected and affected by the ocean.
And the natural ocean that we dreamed of as a child is becoming more and more difficult to find.
They're under increasing pressure, and they're under threat.
I've left us humans in the presence of the world's leading predator, witnessing and photographing the impact of the wave on nature.
For a long time, I thought I had to show the audience a shocking picture to wake up from apathy.
And even though this approach has its advantages, it's back to where it came from.
The best way to make a difference is to spread love.
Maybe as a medium and photographer, I have a rare opportunity to reveal the animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the surface of the sea.
You can't love and defend anything if you don't even know it exists.
It's the power of environmental photography to reveal the beauty of nature.
I've visited hundreds of oceanic positions, but there are only a few places that have deeply impressed me.
The first time I was in such a state of ecstasy was about 10 years ago on the rocky, wild shores of South Africa.
Every year, in June and July, huge sardines move north to a mass migration called pulsating.
These fish have good reason to run away.
They're being chased by hunger and predators.
They hunt together, and they separate some of them from the main herd and turn them into a lump of bait.
They trap the fish and lure them to the surface of the ocean, where they predate the floating, moving feast.
There's a shark coming in from behind.
Many people think that sharks and dolphins are enemies of the cripples, but they're co-existing in the run.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to predate more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait becomes more and more scattered, and sharks fill their stomachs with what I often call stalwart doughnuts, and their mouths are filled with water.
I've had a few dangerous moments with sharks in class run, but they don't see me as prey.
But at this rowdy feast, I hit and hit like any of the guests, and it hit me on the tail.
On the coast of Africa, we cross a vast Indian Ocean and move east to Maldibro, the island of coral reefs.
And during the monsoon rains in the southwestern part of the country, the whole island of mice moves to a small place in the baa atoll called Haifaru.
A group of choroids, not larger than the eyes, is their main prey.
When plankton is less dense, they feed themselves, just like dogs chasing their tails, and they keep going in the sky.
But when the plankton density increases, they form these long food chains, and the prey outside of the first or the second rat ray is likely to be eaten by the next mouse.
When the plankton levels peak in the bay, they swim close to what we call the Whirlpool.
And as they swim in large groups, they self-wander and suck up plankton with their mouths.
I can't really forget this experience of swimming around a bunch of mice.
When I first photographed Ha Ni Faru, it wasn't protected and it was threatened with development.
Working with NGOs like the Manta Foundation, my photographs ultimately helped Hai Faru turn into a marine reserve.
Fishermen from neighboring islands who were hunting mice to make traditional drums out of their shells.
Now, these are the most passionate environmentalists, and the Maldive economy earns over eight million dollars a year from rat rays.
I've always wanted to travel by the time that the map is mostly empty or that it says, "We buy dragons."
And so far, I've had the closest experience of this in the remote corals west of the Indian Ocean.
The diving away from ocean lanes and fishing fleets is a painful reminder of what our ocean looked like at the time.
Very few people have heard of Vas da India, a small reef island in the Channel of Mozambique.
Corals form an external barrier for protection, and the lagoon is a breeding ground for the Galápagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I roughly assumed that sharks would be bolder at night.
I've never seen a coral reef with so many sharks.
Sharing these moments is a reminder of why I chose this path.
Earlier this year, I went to Baha California as a project for National Geographic magazine.
And on the Pacific side, half-way to San Ignacio Laguna, which is an important place for the ghost whale to give birth.
For a hundred years, the coast was a place of genocide, where more than 20,000 ghost whales were killed and a few hundred left.
Today, descendants of surviving whales push their young to sea level to play with us and even interact with us.
This was a really remarkable return.
On the other side of the peninsula, there's the rugged fishing village of Cabo Fulmo.
For decades, overfishing has led to the collapse of this village.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded the authorities to assign their coasts to the Marine Reserve.
But what's happened since then is a miracle.
After just 10 years of protection in 2005, scientists saw the recovery of the largest fish in history.
But don't believe me. Come with me.
Let's swim together in the largest and densest flock of fish that I've ever encountered.
We can all be creators of hope.
And I want to use my photography to show you that there's still hope in our oceans.
In particular, I want to focus on nature's resilience in the face of a population of 3.3 billion.
My hope is that in the future it's going to be very difficult to take pictures like this, but I want to take pictures that show us and the oceans coexist with each other in respect of each other.
And I hope it's a normal thing to take pictures like that.
If you're going to survive and thrive as a marine photographer, you have to be a great optimismist.
I always believe there's a great picture of change nearby, and it's either in the lagoon or in the lagoon that's next to meet.
When I came to Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1985, the government was putting social justice at the heart of national health policy.
After the long Revolution, a new government entered, and immediately set up a socialistic policy, free health services, basic education.
As the number of local health centers exploded, 80 percent of the population had tremendous success getting within two hours of the health center.
In 1980, immediately after independence, 25 percent of the children were immunized.
Ten years later, in 1990, the rate grew to 80 percent.
I'm so proud to be part of this change and revolution.
I felt intense excitement and sympathy with people.
Working with great scientists, doctors, and activists in Zimbabwe, I felt that I was in the field of the African Revolution, and I was in the arena of the world welfare movement.
In 1985, the first year I arrived,
The first cases of HlV infection were reported in Zimbabwe.
I've had some AlDS patients in my medical training, but I can't expect the same health resources in Africa.
In the early days, the infection rate was about 2%, which was about 17 years later when I left Harare,
Up to one in four.
In the mid-1990s, I sentenced hundreds of people at the peak of their lives to HlV positive.
I saw my colleagues, my friends, my students, my patients die.
In response, my colleagues and I opened the clinic.
We taught them how to use condoms.
We've had education at school and at work.
We talked about how the partners of the infected would protect themselves from the disease.
I worked hard, and I believed I was doing my best at the time.
As a doctor, I treated patients well, but I didn't argue that there was a need for structural change.
Former UN President Kofi Annan spoke up about his mistake in calling the Rwandan Holocaust.
In 1994, he was the UN peacekeeping director.
In his tenth talk on the Holocaust, he recalled: “I believed that I was doing my best at the time, but when I looked back after the Holocaust, I realized that there were more things I could or should have done, and I could have told them and helped them."
Now that AlDS has destroyed the health system and the World Health Organization has killed an estimated 39 million people, I also feel regret and regret about things I didn't do earlier.
Until I was in Zimbabwe, I didn't view my role as a policy support or political engagement.
I was there as an expert in medical and epidemiology technology.
In my mind, my work was to take care of patients and to understand the spread of disease through research to slow down the spread of disease.
I knew that the marginalized population in society had been exposed to the threat of AlDS.
In sugar farms, which are more closed than any modern business, 60 percent of pregnant women were infected with AlDS.
I tried to tell you that AlDS infection is not a moral degradation but a result of male chauvinism and forced migration and colonization.
Whites had low rates of infection.
As health experts, the tools we were given were very poor enough to encourage changes in lifestyles, the use of condoms, the reduction of same-sex partners.
The rate of infection kept going up, and the best hope was that the cure was developed in the West, but it wasn't going to spread to Africa at cost.
I didn't have my voice to justify my silence, that I was just a guest in this country, that if I warned you, I would be deported, and I would no longer be able to care for the patient, or have the necessary research.
So I responded to the government's initial response to AlDS.
I didn't say my concerns loud enough.
A lot of doctors, a lot of health experts will think that there's nothing wrong with me.
His oath to the patient, the Hippocratic oath, means the sanctity of patient-doctor relations.
And I gave each patient everything I could.
But I knew that disease arose from the cracks in our society, not just in biology, but in social imbalance, inequities and discrimination of race, gender and class.
AlDS did.
This was recently the attitude of Boola.
Paul Palmer, a medical anthropologist who studied AlDS in Haiti, calls this "structural violence" because the problem with structure is that there are political and economic injustices in our society that we are not conscious of, because violence results in early death, suffering and disease.
If you don't know about this social injustice, the treatment is secondary.
It's the first step to public health rights, and it's a way to solve problems and make real changes, so today, I'm not silent.
Even if it's uncomfortable for those who hear it,
Even though I'm uncomfortable with myself, I'm saying a lot of things, most of them are about racial polarization or racial polarization.
These are things that should no longer be in this country, especially medicine, public health.
But they have buries, and we don't care much.
That's why it's a duty in New York to warn of the effects of racial discrimination on health in America, and to warn that ethnic violence every day, that violence by color, by individuals, will lead to slave slavery, 90 years of racial discrimination, and 60 years of incomplete equality.
Blacks 50 percent higher than whites.
In 2012, black women were more than 10 times as likely to die during childbirth as white women.
And despite a huge drop in infant mortality, black babies still have a three-fold higher risk of dying the first year than white babies, not New York.
This statistic is similar to the statistics that we found across the United States.
In a recent analysis, the New York Times reported that 1.5 million black men across the country are missing, followed by the fact that they have to be between 25 and 54 years of age.
One out of six black men is jailed, or because of an early death, young men are suffering from inequality and one-way violence in their daily lives.
The latest social movement, #BarkLivesMateter Hasstag, is well represented, but we're at the same time seeing the hardships of these people and the challenges they face.
And as a result of all the risks and the incidence of major diseases, you have to remember that diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, AlDS, are slowly encroaching on their lives, causing premature death.
As the BlackLives Matter movement developed, I was disappointed and angry that the medical community didn't even use the word racism in research or in the workplace.
My feelings will be conveyed to you.
While medical students often campaign in 100 percent, the medical community is generally silent about the effects of social discrimination on the spread and mortality of disease.
And I'm going to talk to you about the personalization, the precision of modern medicine, the development of biological or genetic treatments, and the fact that these movements, the side effects of which we live, the growth, the work and the loving daily life, have the greatest impact on public health, and that there are so many people who are unhappy.
Every time we take care of our daily health professionals, or do research, we realize that there's a lot of denial, whether we're homeless, who's more urgent than their illness, who can't follow the prescription, or we're young people who can't stand the discrimination of our society, who are considering suicide, or who are responsible for their own child's illness.
As a health professional, our role is not just to treat patients, but to warn them and to urge them to change.
Right or wrong, our social status empowers us, and we shouldn't waste it.
So, regretting my work in Zimbabwe, I decided that I would be willing to give advance warning and support for health equality.
I want your help, and I'm going to help you talk about genderism and other discrimination, and I'm going to show you that we're going to be able to stand up and talk about how we're doing.
It's time to make a voice together about structural inequality, how we need to change.
It doesn't matter all the cases. It's just the courage that we need.
The health of our patients, of all of us, depends here.
Raise your hand if you've ever blocked someone on Facebook who said something that was offensive to politics, religion, parenting and food.
Or is there at least one person you want to avoid?
In the old days, Henry Higgins said, "Just talk about the weather and the health."
Now, because of climate change and anti- Vaccination movements, those topics are dangerous too.
The world we live in is a world where every conversation is likely to develop into an argument, where politicians can't talk to each other, and the smallest problem is somebody's passionate about it.
We've studied 10,000 adult Americans at the Puppies Institute, and now we're the most polarized and divided in history.
It's less likely to compromise, which means you don't listen to anyone else.
Where you live, who you marry, and who you make friends with, it's determined by what you believe.
They don't listen to other people.
Conversations need to be balanced, but ever since, we've lost that balance.
It's partly due to the development of technology.
We're always holding our smartphones, or we're always living next to each other so that we can pick them up.
According to the Pew Institute, one out of every three American teenagers sends over 100 text messages every day.
And it's said that most teenagers talk in text more often than they talk to their friends face-to-face.
There was an interesting article on the Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Vanwell.
Mr. Vanwell told his students about a subject.
I gave them the task of saying it on-the-fly, without writing it in a notebook.
And Mr. Vanwell said,
"I realized that the art of conversation is one of the most underrated and unteachable skills."
They communicate through the screen for hours every day, but they don't have a lot of opportunities to clean up human and human communication skills.
Now, this may be a strange question, but let's ask ourselves, is there some ability in the 21st century that's more important than being logical and confident in conversation?
I'm talking to people, Nobel Prize winner, truck driver, kindergarten teacher, plumber...
I talk to people I like, and I talk to people I don't like.
I'm talking to people who I don't personally agree with very much.
But we have a good conversation.
So I'm going to tell you in the next 10 minutes how to talk to you and how to hear.
Many of you may already have heard some advice about this, such as looking in the eyes, talking in advance, thinking about interesting topics, noding, laughing and listening to each other, or saying or summising what you've just heard.
Forget all this advice.
It's bullshit.
If you really pay attention, you don't have to learn to listen.
Even when I'm having everyday conversations,
I use my skills when I'm doing professional interviews.
I'm going to teach you the art of interviews, and I'm going to teach you how to do something that doesn't hurt people who don't have too much time and who don't get bored.
Learn to talk.
We've all had good conversations, and since we've done it before, we know what a good conversation is like, you know, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in, we're in.
A conversation that feels like it's really working or that feels like it's completely understood.
Most of your conversations don't tell you to do that, and I'm going to give you 10 basic rules, and I'm going to give you all the details, but if you go through one of them, you're going to be able to do that.
We can enjoy a much better conversation.
First of all, don't do a lot of things at the same time -- your cell phone, your tablet, your car keys, whatever you have in your hands.
I'm not just asking you to put it down.
Stay faithful at that moment.
Focus.
The argument you had with your boss, this evening menu.
Don't think about that, if you want to end the conversation, don't give yourself a little bit of attention.
Second, don't preach.
If you want to express your opinion, and you don't want to react, argue, argue, or grow, just write on your blog.
I don't have a news critic on my show because they're boring.
If you're conservative, you don't like Obama, you don't like welfare, you don't like abortion.
If you're progressive, you don't like big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
It's completely obvious.
You can't do this.
Always approach the conversation with the idea that there's something to learn.
A famous therapist, M. Scott Spec, said that true listening is about putting yourself down.
That means there are times when you have to put your personal opinion down.
According to him, when the listener feels that he's being accepted, he becomes weaker and more open.
Again, think about it all the time.
Bill Age: "Every person you meet knows something you don't know."
In my words, everyone is an expert in a field.
Third, ask questions that you can answer freely.
Learn about this in the way journalists do it.
Start with the bottom line.
When you ask complicated questions, you get simple answers.
And I said, "Are you afraid?"
You're going to respond to fear, the most intense word in the question, and say, "Yes," or "No."
"Are you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let the person who answers describe it. You know how you feel.
"How did you feel?" or "How did you feel?"
Ask him.
And then the person who answers will have to think about it for a second, and they'll have a more interesting answer.
Fourth, follow the course of the conversation.
When you think of something in your head, it means you have to get it out of your head.
If you look at some interviews, there's a few minutes of guest talking, and then there's another time when the socialist suddenly asks you a question that you've already answered.
I had a very keen question for the conductor, so two minutes ago, I didn't listen to him anymore, just waiting for the moment to ask him that question.
We do the same thing.
I was sitting there talking with somebody, and all of a sudden I remember seeing Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
And we stop listening.
You're going to think about a topic or a topic.
But we have to let it go.
Fifth, say you don't know.
The people on radio these days, especially public television, are aware of what they're saying, so they're careful to say, "I know because I'm an expert in this field."
You're too careful.
The conversation should not be casual.
Six, don't equate your experience with someone else's experience.
If someone talks about the death of your family, don't talk about it when you lost your family.
If someone tells you the company's hard work, don't complain about your work.
It's not the same.
All experiences are different.
First of all, you're not the center.
You don't have to use that moment to show off or to take pride in it.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking how many IQs are there, and he said, "I don't know, the IQ person is a loser."
Talking isn't a chance for self-loathing.
Number seven, don't say another word, it's like you're being high-handed and it's really boring, but we do it all the time.
Especially when you're at work, when you're talking to a child, if you have a point that you want to talk to, you're going to say the same thing.
Don't do that.
Eighth, don't be obsessed with details.
To be honest, I'm not interested in the exact year, the name, the date, the details that you're trying to remember, and I'm interested in you.
I care about who you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details, you don't have to say anything.
9th, not last, but most important.
Listen.
So many great people have said, perhaps the most important thing you can develop, is that the Buddha says, "If your mouth is open, you're not learning."
President Calvin Coolidge said, "No one's been fired for a lot of it."
Why don't we listen?
First, because we want to talk about it.
I control the conversation when I say it.
You don't have to listen to something I don't care about.
I'm the one who's paying attention.
I can strengthen my identity.
But there's another reason. We distract.
You could say, on average, 225 words per minute, but you could hear up to 500 words per minute.
That's why you're filling up the other 275 words in your head.
You know, it takes a lot of effort and energy to focus on other people, but if you don't focus, you're not talking.
It's just two people throwing unrelated sentences in the same space of time.
We need to listen to each other.
Stephen Kirby said,
"We don't listen to understand, we listen to answer."
And then finally, the tenth one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and then the last one, and the last one, and the last one, and the last one, and the last one, and the last one, and the last one.
'A good conversation is a miniskirt, short enough to keep you interested, long enough to cover the subject.'
I grew up under my famous grandfather, and there was a kind of ceremony in the house.
If someone came to talk to my grandparents, my mom would tell me who she was and she would tell me.
"That's Miss America.
That's the mayor of Sacramento.
He's the Pulitzer Prize winner. He's the Russian ballerina."
So I grew up thinking that there was something really amazing hidden in everyone.
I think that's what made me a good social worker.
I keep my mouth open, I keep my mouth open, I always prepare for surprise, and I'm never disappointed.
So do you.
Go out and talk to people and listen and, most of all, be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you.
Good morning.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I won a series of medals from three of the sports events in Canada, and I competed at an international level basketball competition, and I was proud to represent Canada on a global stage.
I train basketball and speed skating for five days a week, and I try to be the best in my career with the best coaches and psychiatrists.
All of this is possible through the special Olympics.
Have you changed your mind about me and my achievements?
The world doesn't see people like me as champions.
Just a few years ago, people like me were the ones who had to be hidden.
After the beginning of the special Olympics in 1968, there were many changes, but in most cases, intellectual disabled people are invisible to many people.
People know it doesn't matter when they're using the word "quick" in front of me.
It's used as a term that curses and desecrates people with "diseases" or "sympathetics."
They don't think about how much this is going to hurt me and my friends.
I hope you don't think I'm here for charity.
I'm here because there's still a big problem with how many people look at the mentally disabled, or in too many cases, they don't even recognize them.
Did you know there was a world convention this year?
I was one of over 6,500 intellectual disabled athletes from 165 countries who met in L.A. to participate in the special Olympics.
More than 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, and live transmissions from the TSN and ESPN channels.
Did you know this happened?
If you see someone like me, what do you think?
I want you and me here today to look at us as equals.
The special Olympics change the identity of the intellectual disabled.
It also changes the perspective of everyone who's watching, and for those of you who don't know it,
The special Olympics are competitions for intellectual disabled athletes.
It's separate from the Olympics, which are disabled, and we're going to do a lot of work to change the quality of life for people with intellectual disabilities.
This movement has changed not only my life, but the lives of many others, and it has changed the lives of the entire world who are mentally disabled.
It changed the way we looked at it.
I was born with brain failure and intellectual disorder.
When I was a kid, I played hockey until I was 12, and the bigger I grew up, the more frustrated and angry I was because I couldn't keep up with other kids.
I didn't exercise for a while, I didn't have many friends, I was lonely and sad.
There was a time in society when the intellectual disabled were hidden.
No one knew they were going to do it, nor did anyone know they were going to be a precious part of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the impact that regular exercise had on the health level of children with intellectual disabilities.
Dr. Hayden and other researchers, through a thorough scientific study, have concluded that children with intellectual disabilities were less able to participate in sports and therefore less able to do so.
A lot of people wondered if a lot of health programs and gyms were going to benefit the intellectual disabled.
But Dr. Hayden and Eunice Kennedy, founder of the special Olympics, did not act as pioneers, and the special Olympicists proved that they were right four and a half million times.
Before I joined the special Olympics, I was very insecure, because I was young, timid, self-confidenceless, not very many friends.
But as soon as I was on that stage, everyone encouraged me, supported me, and helped me to be completely self, regardless of what others looked at me.
I'm now a basketball player, and I'm a speed skater, and I competed in local and national contests, and I'm a player at the lower Olympics in Los Angeles this year, and I'm the first basketball team in the history of Canada to go to the World Games.
I'm one of over four and a half million athletes in the world, but I've heard a lot of similar stories.
Being a special Olympic athlete restores our self-worth and self-worth.
Also, the special Olympics deal with important health needs.
A lot of studies have shown that average intellectual disabled men die 13 years earlier than normal men, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years earlier than normal women.
The special Olympics keep us moving and participating in the movement, making us healthy.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
And furthermore, the special Olympics provide free health examinations for those who have difficulty communicating with doctors or those who have difficulty with health care.
At the Summer Olympics in 2015, my Canadian colleagues and I played with a Nigerian basketball team.
The day before the game, the Nigerian team went to the World Champions' Health Check, and seven out of 10 players were able to get free hearing aids for the first time in their lives.
The changes that came to them were enormous.
They were more excited, they were happy, they were confident, they were able to communicate with you.
I was also thrilled by the sound of basketball, the sound of whistles, the cheers of the crowd -- these sounds that are so obvious to us.
The special Olympics don't just change players in one game.
They're changing their lives outside the stadium.
Studies this year show that half of the adult population in the United States do not know anyone who is mentally disabled, and 44 percent of Americans who are not personally involved in intellectual disability have much less respect for it.
And there's a word for it, which still means that intelligent people are invisible to so many people.
We use it in light terms, we use it in bad language.
Last year, it was mentioned more than nine million times on Twitter, and for me and four and a half million of my colleagues around the world, this is a huge wound.
A lot of people think it's not offensive, but it's not.
John Franklin Stevens, a colleague of mine and a global messenger, answered publicly to a political expert who used the word "wow" as an insult, and said, "When will you join us at the special Olympics?
Let's see if your mind can walk away without changing."
This year, 2015, at the Summer Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the reverse finish.
Eventually my proud colleague, Jackie Barrett, picked up 297 kilos, lifted 277 kilos from the Square, which was the best in the history of the special Olympics.
Jackie is the top record owner of all of Newfoundland's weight players, not only in the special Olympics, but in all of them.
Jackie was a big star in L.A., and ESPN tweeted his records in real time and admired his game.
50 years ago, not many people thought intelligent people would do that.
This year in the L.A. Memorial Coliseum, 60,000 spectators have filled their seats to see the opening of the World Games, and they've supported thousands of athletes from 165 countries all over the world.
Instead of being hidden, we were cheered up, we were celebrated.
The special Olympics teach players to feel confident and to feel proud.
The special Olympics teach the world that intellectual disabled people are part of our society that deserves to be respected.
I'm now trying to be a personal trainer, having dreams, having achievements, having great coaches, having respect, feeling self-worth, being much healthier.
I'm no longer hiding or being teased, but I'm here to give a TED Talk.
The special Olympics have changed the world a lot, but they still have a long way to go.
So the next time you meet an intelligently disabled person, look at his talents.
The next time someone around you uses the word "temper", I want you to know how much that little word hurts.
And I want you to join the special Olympics.
I'll tell you one last thing.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sports have the power to change the world."
The special Olympics are changing the world, changing four and a half million players, giving us a more confident place to stand, to meet our friends, not to be judged, to be a champion, to be a champion.
Thank you.
You may not have heard of kenema or arua.
But I know those two places are the strangest places on earth.
There's a community of nurses, doctors and scientists who have been quietly facing the greatest deadly threat of humanity for years.
The Lasa virus is very much like Ebola.
It can cause severe fever, and it can be very lethal.
And yet they will die every day to protect those who are here, and to protect us all.
But the strangest thing I learned about them when I first visited them a few years ago was that they started a hard day at the front line as a song.
They come together to share their joy.
It's showing their projections.
And over the years, when I visit them and when they come to me, we gather together to sing and write and have fun, because it just tells us that we're here in the pursuit of science, and that we're united in a bond of humanity that we share.
And as you can imagine, that process became very important and necessary even when something changed.
And in March 2014, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea, it changed a lot.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the Sierra Leone and Liberian border.
And I was very scared, and we were all scared.
We actually suspected for a while that Rasa and Ebola were going to spread more widely than we thought, and one day they'd come to Kennema.
So the members of my research team were immediately sent out to join Dr. Homa Khan and his team in preparing a precise molecular diagnosis to make sure that Ebola would be able to know right away if she came across the border to Sierra Leone.
We've already built this system of Lassa virus, and we know how to deal with it this time.
We just had to give them the tools and the places to investigate Ebola.
And unfortunately, the day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital's gynecology department, and the team performed an important molecular diagnosis and confirmed the first Ebola case in Sierra Leone.
And this was an amazing thing.
They were able to diagnose this case immediately, and start tracking contact to make sure that the patient was safely treated, and see what was going on.
You could have stopped something.
But by the time that day came, she had been breeding for months.
For hundreds of cases, we've already surpassed the diseases that have occurred in the past.
And it's not just one case in Sierra Leone, it's like a tsunami.
We've covered a lot of cases with international communities and health care and Kinemas, 31 cases a week, then 92, then 147, all of them coming to Kennema, which is the only place we can deal with in Sierra Leone.
And we've been doing everything we can for 24 hours, trying to help people, trying to get attention, but we've done another simple thing.
The samples from the patient's blood to find Ebola, of course, can be discarded.
And what we can do is put chemicals in and deactivate them, put them in boxes and carry them across the ocean, and we did that.
I sent my team to work in Boston.
We've been working all day, all day long, and we've made 99 Ebola virus genomes.
This was the blueprint for the virus's genome.
It's all of us.
They talk about everything that makes us, and they tell us a lot of information.
The results of these experiments are very simple and very influential.
We were able to look at these 99 different viruses and compare them with the three genomes that actually developed in Guinea a few months ago, and we could show that they came from Guinea and entered the human race, and were transmitted from humans to humans.
It's very important to know how to intervene, but more importantly, it's a contact tracking investigation.
We can see that the virus is being transformed as it spreads amongst people.
And each mutation was very important, because there were many diagnostics and vaccines, the light cures that we were using, and all of these were based on essentially moving gene sequences.
So global health experts had to react to this, develop it, recalculate everything they did.
But the way science works at that point would have been to collect data, to work in quarantine rooms for months, to analyze data very carefully and slowly, to suggest papers to publish, to do research, and when the paper was finally published, the data would have been distributed.
That's how it works.
But at this point, it won't work, right?
We had friends on the front lines, and what we obviously needed was help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was, as soon as the genome sequences were checked on the machine, we released them to the web.
I opened it all up to the world and I said, "Help me."
And help's coming.
Before we even knew it, people from all over the world had contacted us, and we were surprised to see the data.
And some of the great virus pursuers were at one point with our community.
We worked together in a virtual way -- sharing, regular phone calls, communication -- trying to find ways to stop the virus every single time, every time.
There are many ways to create these communities.
Especially as the outbreak of disease spread around the world, everybody's got their hands out to learn about it, to participate in it, to engage in it.
Everyone wanted to play the role.
The amount of human capacity shown here is amazing, and the Internet has connected us all.
Instead of being afraid of each other, you say, "Let's do this.
Let's work together."
But the problem was with the data that we all used, and Googleling on the Web was limited to doing what we had to do.
And when that happens, we miss out on a lot of opportunities.
In the early days of the Kinema epidemic, we had 106 clinical records of patients, and we released them to the world again.
And in our lab, we were able to train computers to get you access to 106 records and predict the forecasts of Ebola's patients with 100 percent accuracy.
And we also created an app to distribute so that the medical staff on the site could use it.
But 106 didn't get to the point where it was powerful and appreciated.
So we're waiting for more data to be distributed.
They're still not coming.
We're still waiting in quarantine, making improvements instead of working together.
And that's something that we can't accept.
Don't you? You can't all accept it.
Because our lives are at stake.
And in fact, I lost a lot of lives, including a lot of medical personnel, my colleagues, five colleagues: Embalo Poni, Alex Moigboy, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Koboma and Mohamad Fulla.
These are five of the hundreds of medical staff who have died in Kennema and elsewhere, waiting for the world to wait, quietly, when we're all working.
You know, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is made worse by distrust and dispersal and disunity.
When we build barriers that separate us from each other, and we fight each other, the virus thrives.
But unlike everything that threatens humanity, the place where we are all the same human being is Ebola.
We're all in this fight together.
The Ebola disease in one family can be ours at some point.
So, with the same vulnerability, the same power, the same fear, the same hope, I hope that we can work together happily.
One of my graduate students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and he noticed that the word "Kenema," which we worked in hospitals and towns in Sierra Leone, comes from the Mende words, "clean and transparent and open in the eyes of the public, like a river."
It surprised us all, because before we even knew it, we always felt that if we wanted to honor the people in Kennema, we had to work openly, share, and work together.
And I have to.
We all have to ask from ourselves and from others to open our hearts to fight with each other when we get sick.
And it's not the first, because it's not the first, and it's not the last, there's a lot of microbes waiting outside.
And the next time this happens, it can happen in more than tens of thousands of cities.
It could be an airborne disease.
It could spread deliberately.
I know it's scary, but I also know this, and this experience shows us that we have the skills and the ability to win, so we win the virus.
But we have to be together to do it, and we have to be happy to do it.
So for Dr. Khan, and for the millions who have sacrificed with us all the time at the front of this fight, let's always be with them in this fight.
Instead of defining it as a world destroyed by viruses, let's unite and shine by billions of minds and minds.
Thank you.
