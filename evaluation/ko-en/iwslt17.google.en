This story is about how we know what we know.
This story is about this woman. Natalia Lipchinsky.
She is a paleontologist. In other words, she&#39;s an expert at digging up things that died a very long time ago.
Natalia Lipchinsky: Yes, they call me “Dr. Dead”.
Latif Nasa: And the reason I was interested in her is because of where she digs things up. She works in the remote Canadian tundra, well above the Arctic Circle.
One summer day in 2006, she was at an excavation site called the Fyles Leaf Bed. It is less than 10 degrees latitude away from the magnetic North Pole.
Natalia: Did you? It wasn&#39;t a big deal at all. Because I walked around all day with my GPS and laptop in my backpack, picking up everything that looked like fossils.
Latif: And at some point she realizes something.
Natalia: It was rusty, it had a rusty color and was the size of my palm.
It was just lying on the ground.
Latif: At first she thought it was just a piece of wood. Because people have found prehistoric plant fossils in the Fyles Leaf Bed before.
But that night, back at camp,
Natalia: I took out my pocket magnifying glass and looked a little closer and realized. It doesn&#39;t look like it has growth rings.
I thought it might be something that needs to be preserved. But this is really
It looked like a bone.
LATIF: So over the course of four years she continued to explore the area. And in the end, 30 pieces of the same bone were collected. Most of them were really small pieces.
Natalia: It&#39;s no big deal. Even if I tried, it would all fit in one Ziploc.
LATIF: And she tried to put the bones together like a puzzle.
But it was a very difficult task.
Natalia: It was in so many pieces that I tried using sand and binder, but it didn&#39;t look good.
So in the end, we filmed it with a 3D scanner.
Latif: Oh! Natalia: So, you did well, right?
Latif: Actually, that was a much easier way.
Natalia: It was magical how the pieces came together.
Latif: How confident were you that these pieces were coming together correctly?
Was there a possibility that it was assembled incorrectly? Isn&#39;t it a bone from a small parakeet or something?
Natalia: Um, no. No, you did it right.
Latif: According to her, what she found was the tibia. It&#39;s a leg bone. And to be exact, it is the leg bone of a cloven-hoofed mammal. Animals like cows and sheep.
But these couldn&#39;t be two different animals.
Because the bones were too big.
Natalia: It was really big. It was the bone of a very large animal.
Latif: Then what kind of animal is it?
While she was thinking about it, she showed one of the pieces to a colleague in Colorado and they gave their opinion.
Natalia: We cut the ends off with a saw. And a really interesting smell came out of that gap.
Latif: It smelled like burning flesh.
It was the smell she smelled in that gross anatomy class. It smelled like collagen.
Collagen plays a role in the structure of bones.
And it usually falls apart over time.
However, in this case, the Arctic was preserved by acting as a natural freezer.
A year or two later, Natalia saw her colleague Mike Buckley demonstrating something called &quot;collagen fingerprinting&quot; at a conference in Bristol.
The point is that different species have slightly different collagen structures. So, if there is a collagen structure of an unidentified bone here, it can be compared with the structure of a known species. And who knows, maybe you&#39;ll find a match.
So she sent one piece to her colleague. By FedEx.
Natalia: Yes, I want to confirm delivery. It&#39;s important.
Latif: And he analyzed and compared it to 37 known modern mammalian species.
Found a match.
According to the results of the investigation, this bone is from 3.5 million years ago, and the owner of this bone that Natalia dug up in the Arctic Circle...
It was a camel.
Natalia: At the time, I was like this. what? That&#39;s amazing--if it&#39;s true.
Latif: So we tested other pieces and the test results were all the same.
However, the size of the bones found suggests that this camel was 30% larger than a modern camel.
So this camel is 9 feet tall and weighs about a ton.
That&#39;s right.
Natalia discovers a giant arctic camel.
Now, this is what you probably think when you hear the word &#39;camel&#39;. Bactrian camels of East Asia and Central Asia,
You may have this dromedary camel in your head, something you usually see on postcards. As a typical desert animal, it lives in hot desert areas. It is an animal that lives in places such as the Middle East and the Sahara. It has a large hump on its back to store moisture for long desert treks, and it climbs over sand dunes with its large, wide feet.
So how did these friends come to the Arctic Circle?
Well, scientists have known for a long time. What was revealed before Natalia&#39;s discovery was that the camel was actually from America.
This is where camels first appeared.
Camels first appeared about 40 to 45 million years ago and were found only in North America. It turns out there were about 20 species, and there may be more.
Latif: If you compare all camels, can you tell the difference between them?
Natalia: Yes, camels are different sizes.
Some camels have really long necks. It&#39;s actually a camel that looks like a giraffe.
Latif: Some species have snouts like crocodiles?
Natalia: Camels in their primitive stages were really, really small. Almost like a rabbit.
Latif: What? A camel the size of a rabbit?
Natalia: Yes, a camel in its primitive stage.
It probably wouldn&#39;t be considered a camel.
Latif: Oh my gosh, I want to own a bunny camel.
Natalia: Me too. Doesn’t that sound good?
Latif: And about 3 to 7 million years ago, a species of camel crossed into South America. There they evolve into llamas and alpacas. Other species cross the Bering Land Bridge into Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the Ice Age, North American camels became extinct.
Scientists knew all this. But that didn&#39;t fully explain what Natalia discovered far north.
For example, in terms of temperature, the polar regions are the complete opposite of the Sahara.
To be precise, 3.5 million years ago it was on average about 20 degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.
So the Arctic Circle would also have been a boreal forest. It would have been similar to today&#39;s Yukon or Siberia.
But it was still an area where winter lasted for six months, and puddles of water froze over.
It must have been where a blizzard occurred.
It would have been an area with a polar night lasting 24 hours.
How... how?
How could this Saharan superstar survive the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her colleagues come up with a hypothesis.
And it was a pretty brilliant idea.
What if the camels we think of as being able to adapt well to places like the Sahara were actually evolved to survive winter? This is it.
What if the camel&#39;s wide feet were not for crossing the desert but for walking on snow? It’s like a folktale.
If the camel&#39;s hump -- that was big news to me. It doesn&#39;t contain water, but rather contains fat. What if this helps us get through the six months of winter when food is scarce?
And what if camels later, long after crossing the Bering Land Bridge, adapted these wintering features for the hot desert environment?
For example, bumps on your back may be helpful in hot climates. Because the fat in the body is concentrated in one place, like a fat bag, there is no need for insulation covering the entire body.
The hump on their back makes it easier to block out heat.
It may sound strange, but the essential reasons why camels can live in the desert can serve as evidence that camels lived in the Arctic Circle in the past.
Actually, this is not my first time telling this story.
Others say it&#39;s a wonder of evolutionary biology or a key to future climate change.
But the reason I like this story is different.
I think this is a story about us. I think it&#39;s a story about how we view the world and how it changes.
I am a historian.
And I realized that many scientists are like historians.
That proving the past is the same.
Scientists also talk about the universe, the Earth, and life on Earth.
And as a historian, I thought about where this story could go.
Natalia: We make hypotheses and we think they are true. Like camels live in the desert. Isn&#39;t it?
That&#39;s the perfect story! I completely believed it.
As you can see, camels live in the desert.
Lataf: But at some point you find the smallest evidence and
That little thing can turn everything you&#39;ve ever known upside down.
In this case, a scientist discovered a piece of what he thought was a tree, and that gave the scientific community a completely new and counterintuitive theory about why this Dr. Seuss-looking animal looks like it does.
And for me, the whole idea of camels was turned upside down.
From an incredibly rare animal that can only grow in certain environments to one that traveled the world and ended up in the Sahara. In fact, it&#39;s not strange anywhere in the world.
This friend is Azuri.
Hello Azuri! How do you feel?
Here, take one of these.
Azzurri is currently taking a short break from regular performances. This is a performance at Radio City Music Hall.
It&#39;s not a joke.
Anyway-- the reason Azuri is here is to let you know that the story of this world is dynamic.
It&#39;s something we need to re-adapt and re-imagine.
yes? Azuri?
And indeed, one small piece of bone changed the way we see the world.
thank you
Today&#39;s computers are so amazing that it&#39;s hard to notice how terrible they are at the same time.
Today I&#39;m going to highlight computer problems and show you how to solve them using neuroscience.
First, let me tell you about an important incident that happened to me on a cold night in Harlem in 2011.
I was sitting in a bar outside Columbia University. Here I majored in computer science and neuroscience. I was in a bar chatting with a friend about how holograms would one day replace computers.
And as our conversation reached its peak, my friend&#39;s cell phone rang.
My friend pulled the phone down and started typing while looking down.
Then he raised his eyes with difficulty, looked at me, and said, “Go on. “I’m listening to everything.”
But there was no heat in my friend&#39;s eyes. The moment has already cooled down.
Meanwhile, across the street, another student took out his cell phone and held it out to the group.
He was flipping through photos on Instagram and laughing happily with his group.
It struck me that it was the same technology that made me feel bad and made them happy at the same time.
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it was not the content of the digital information itself that led to different results, but simply the direction of the screen, which separated me from my friend and bound the other side together.
The bond between those friends over cell phones was like our ancestors developing social skills by sitting around a campfire and talking.
In my opinion, this is how tools should function.
It should become an extension of your body.
And I think today&#39;s computers are just the opposite.
Whether you&#39;re emailing your wife, composing a symphony, or comforting a friend, you do things similarly on your computer.
You encounter squares and touch buttons and menus to bring up other squares.
I think this is wrong. I think you can use a much more natural machine.
We need to use machines that do things in the real world.
We need to apply neuroscience principles to machines to extend our senses rather than run counter to them.
We have such a machine right here, right now.
This is meta 2.
Let&#39;s give it a try.
I can vividly see the audience in front of me and my hands.
Count three, two, one and a realistic hologram will appear. Now I have a very realistic hologram in front of me, the very same device I am using.
These holograms become both the products we shop for and the objects we explore. You can also use your hands to make precise movements.
It&#39;s a sight that even Iron Man would be proud of.
We&#39;ll see this machine again in a moment.
If you&#39;re like me, you&#39;re imagining what&#39;s possible with this technology. So let me show you.
My mother is an architect. Naturally, I thought about representing architecture in 3D. It&#39;s not a 2D blueprint like it is now.
My mother also touches the graphics and selects the interior decorations.
This scene is actually filmed on Meta 2.
The following example resonates with me: Professor Adam Ghazali&#39;s Transparent Brain Project. We received permission from UCSF.
As a neuroscience student, I always imagined learning and memorizing complex brain structures with the help of machines. Playing with complex brain structures. This technology is called ‘augmented reality’.
But I think it goes further than this and is a process of expanding our body&#39;s capabilities with the help of machines. Not the other way around.
now...
In the next few years, humanity will undergo a great transformation.
Humanity will begin to build a corresponding layer of digital information on top of the physical world.
Imagine what change this will bring. Storytellers, painters, brain surgeons, interior decorators, for those of us here.
And I believe that we should all work together and discuss ways to create this new reality through many attempts and efforts, and think about how to expand the human experience, and not make it like a game or fill it with only information.
And I&#39;m very passionate about this.
Now, let me tell you a little secret.
In about 5 years this will not be a minimal device. In about five years, it will be improved in the form of a thin glass strip that projects holograms into the eye. And just as when we buy a phone we choose it based on the operating system rather than the hardware, as a neuroscientist I have always dreamed of creating iOS for the mind.
The development of this OS must be very careful, because as we have used Windows, we may have to live in the new OS for a long time in the future.
I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;m afraid to live in Windows.
We put neuroscience at the core of our designs to find the most intuitive interfaces for users, and you won&#39;t see designs being created in a boardroom.
The principle we always repeat when designing is to find “the neural circuit with the least discomfort.”
At every step, we seek to connect the iOS of your mind with the intuition of your brain. In other words, we want to create a computer that doesn&#39;t need any instructions.
We&#39;re building computers that you can use instinctively.
The following three design guidelines are for creating a new user experience:
These are the things we pursue. The first and most important thing is
You are your own operating system.
Traditional file systems are complex and unintuitive, forcing additional understanding on your brain.
In other words, it does not go through the circuit with the least discomfort.
On the other hand, in augmented reality, you can put the holographic TED screen here and your email on the other side, and use the spatial capabilities of reality to pull up the hologram.
You could even take out that Tesla you were shopping for. This applies only to car models for which the legal team has obtained consent for use prior to the lecture.
great. The brain understands this process perfectly.
The second instruction/ is what is called “touch and see.”
What do babies do when something catches their attention?
Reach out and try to touch it.
This is how a natural machine would work.
It turns out that for the visual system to be very effective, you need proprioception, or a sense of where your body is in the system.
Therefore, being able to touch it directly not only makes it easier to operate, but also allows you to understand the content more deeply.
You can touch and see it.
But experiencing it alone is not enough.
We are social animals.
This is our third guideline. It&#39;s a holographic bonfire fueled by stories.
The body&#39;s mirror neurons allow us to immerse ourselves in what we do with other people by seeing their faces and hands in 3D.
If you watch the video behind me, two meta users are playing together with the same hologram and making eye contact to communicate. It&#39;s not because of the device that we&#39;re falling apart from each other.
Let&#39;s try the device again with the neuroscience I was talking about in mind.
We&#39;re back with iOS for the spirit.
This time I&#39;ll go further and hold the device in my hand and then place it next to my desk.
I am with you. It&#39;s connected.
Depending on my spatial abilities, I can grab this device and put it back in place. Because I am the operating system.
Now with proprioception working, I can break this device down into thousands of parts and touch the very sensors that are scanning my hand.
But it&#39;s boring to watch alone, so I&#39;ll make a 3D call with co-founder Ray. ray?
Ray, how are you?
Guys, I&#39;m seeing this guy in 3D right before my eyes.
As if it were real.
thank you
My mirror neurons are telling me that this feature will replace phones in the near future.
Ray, how are you?
sure. We&#39;re broadcasting live.
Ray, please give us the holographic brain that we first showed you to the audience here.
Folks, this device will not only change our phones, it will change the way we work together.
thank you
Thanks Ray.
What.
Folks, this is the message I discovered in a bar in 2011. The future of computing is not confined to a square screen.
It&#39;s right here, within us.
What I can tell you today is that natural machines are not future science fiction, they are from 2016.
Because Meta has already built this device, hundreds of Meta&#39;s administration, executives, designers, and engineers will throw away all of the company&#39;s monitors before TED2017 and replace them with truly, truly natural machines.
thank you.
thank you thank you.
thank you everyone.
Chris Anderson: I have a question for you. There have been several augmented reality demonstrations out there before, up until last year.
At that time, there was a debate among engineers about whether the demonstration scene was the actual user&#39;s view.
It&#39;s a question of viewing angle, and the demonstration video appears wider than what you actually see on the device.
Is it what it looks like in the video?
Meron: Leave it as is.
Not only that, but with a lot of adjustments, all the footage was filmed using a camera inside the actual lens.
We put a lot of effort into creating the video to give you the experience of actually using the device when watching the video.
Chris: Thank you for your consideration.
thank you. It&#39;s rewarding.
I come from Seattle, Washington, the most liberal, democratic, tolerant, and progressive city in the country.
I grew up in a family that believed Seattle was the best.
My mother was an artist, and my father was a university professor. I am so grateful for the upbringing I received. I was able to plan my life comfortably.
But actually, I didn&#39;t follow my parents&#39; wishes.
At nineteen, I dropped out of college, got kicked out, and was a pain in the ass.
I went to see Professor French Horn, whom I had dreamed of.
I have performed chamber music in the United States and Europe. I also toured for two years with a great jazz guitar player named Charlie Bird.
At the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
It&#39;s a wonderful life.
My parents never complained.
They gave me all the support.
It wasn&#39;t what they wanted.
My parents used to tell their neighbors and friends: “My son is on a gap year”.
And I had one slightly uncomfortable conversation about my life. I want to tell you a story.
I came back from Barcelona when I was 27 years old. Because it was Christmas, I went to visit my parents. I was cooking in the kitchen with my mother.
My mother was very quiet.
Something was wrong.
I asked my mother. “Mom, what are you thinking about?”
Then he said, “Your father and I are really worried about you.”
So I said. “So what should I be like now?”
My mother said, “I wish you all would tell me: Have you ever voted Republican?”
Yes, actually, I was just a French horn player with no interest in politics.
But what happened was that my parents found out and there was some confusion.
I became a big supporter of capitalism. Let me tell you why.
It stems from poverty, which has been a lifelong concern of mine.
Growing up in Seattle, I remember the first time I saw poverty.
We were a little below middle class, but not poor.
I couldn&#39;t even get close to it.
The first time I saw the reality of poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was six or seven years old.
I was just an ordinary kid.
I came across a photo of a child my age in East Africa in National Geographic magazine. His face was full of flies and his abdomen was distended.
I knew he wouldn&#39;t survive.
Some of you may remember that photo. Even if it&#39;s not just that one photo.
It was to show the West the endless poverty in the world.
That picture haunted me until I was old enough to go to school. I dropped out of school, went back in, and started a family.
And what happened to that child?
I wondered what happened to people like that around the world.
So, even though I didn’t go to college, I started studying. We set out to find an answer: What happens to the poorest people in the world?
Could it be worse? Could it be better?
When I found the answer, it changed my life. I&#39;ll share it with you.
Look--most Americans believe poverty has made them worse than their childhoods.
When you ask Americans, “Has global poverty gotten worse?” 70% of people say that hunger has become more serious than it was in the early 1970s.
But in fact
It was something that changed my thinking.
From 1970 to the present, the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day in the world of hunger, adjusted for inflation, has decreased by 80%.
Since I was a child, global poverty has decreased by 80%.
I didn&#39;t even know.
That&#39;s truly a miracle.
It&#39;s something we should celebrate.
This is the best record of eradicating poverty in human history. And that happened in the era we live in now.
When I found out about it, I became curious. how? How was that possible?
Because if you don&#39;t know why, you can&#39;t do it again.
If we knew why, we could save another 2 million poor people from poverty. That&#39;s our topic: Since I was a child, at least 2 billion people have been lifted out of poverty.
I hope the other 2 billion people do the same.
I tried to find an answer.
Other than political answers, which I&#39;m not interested in.
I still have no interest in politics.
I tried to find answers in all aspects of the economy.
The answer is this.
Let&#39;s see why.
Here are five reasons why 2 billion people were able to escape poverty.
First: globalization.
Second: Free trade.
Third: Poverty Rights
Fourth: provisions of the law
Number five: Start a business.
The large-scale free enterprise system that made that possible spread around the world in the 1970s.
That doesn&#39;t sound naive.
Free enterprise isn&#39;t perfect, but it&#39;s not all we need to create a better world.
But it&#39;s a good thing.
It&#39;s not political either.
Here&#39;s what I learned. This is a revelation.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
At its best, it&#39;s about ambition. This is what many people who stood on this stage said. Ambition comes from dreams and is inherent in free enterprise.
I need to share it with more people. similar to the first
Let&#39;s talk about the second story. I think it will lead to development for both the family and the world.
My favorite quote encapsulates what I was talking about. About saving people from poverty. It&#39;s like this: &quot;Free markets have created the greatest wealth in history.&quot;
They lifted 1 billion people out of poverty.
Who said this?
Sounds like Milton Friedman or Ronal Regan.
no.
This is what President Obama said.
How will I remember?
They told me.
It was crazy.
I said, “Hallelujah.”
But other than that, I said, “This is an opportunity.”
Do you know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, there was an event at Georgetown University in which we participated as the main characters.
And I think that&#39;s the biggest problem facing America today.
I thought it was the answer. What could it be? With these thoughts. Progressives and conservatives, to those who need us most.
I&#39;m not trying to tell you that we&#39;re in crisis. The United States and many countries around the world are suffering from political polarization.
We&#39;re reaching a crisis point.
It&#39;s not good. It&#39;s not right.
There was an article last year. It was published in the National Academy of Sciences, one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
And this is an article about political imbalance published in 2014.
What is this? What is the phenomenon in which psychologists believe that one&#39;s ideology originates from love, but that the opposing party&#39;s ideology originates from hatred?
The answer is a common conflict.
It can also be seen in Palestine and Israel,
The author of this article found that most Republicans and Democrats in America today suffer from political imbalance.
People who are politically active today believe that their own motivation is philanthropy and that their opponents are motivated by hatred.
Think about it.
If a lot of people were walking around and saying, &quot;You know, my ideology is based on compassion, I want to help others, but other people are evil and they get in my way.&quot;
You won&#39;t be able to develop a group with such an imbalance.
It&#39;s impossible.
How do we solve this?
Let&#39;s be honest: there is a difference.
The difference can be minimized: so purely.
A lot of research is needed.
This is Jonathan Hyde, a veteran TED stage representative.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He explores people&#39;s ideas, values, and morals to see differences. As he showed, progressives and Democrats think different things are important.
For example, Jonathan Haidt said the Progressive Party cares about poverty 59% more than it cares about economic freedom.
And Conservatives are 28% more concerned about economic freedom than poverty.
It&#39;s an irreconcilable difference, right?
We will never be able to reconcile. You&#39;re wrong.
That diversity is what makes us strong.
Remember what broke poverty.
The idea of economic freedom and obsession with poverty spread around the world.
In other words, we need each other. If we want to lift the next 2 billion people out of poverty
There is no other way.
hmm.
What should I do?
Isn’t it tricky?
Innovative thinking is needed.
There are a lot of these.
Social entrepreneur. yes. That&#39;s for sure. It&#39;s amazing.
We need overseas investment. In a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way.
Do you know what is most important?
Flexible thinking is required.
We need to become less predictable.
Isn&#39;t it?
Don’t you think that at some point our ideas became predictable?
It&#39;s cliché.
Have you ever felt like you were always hearing stories from people who sympathized with you?
Why is that dangerous?
We talk about the economy in this country, and conservatively we talk about taxes and regulations and government.
And on the progressive side, they talk about income inequality in the economy.
Right? This is important. It&#39;s important to me and to you.
But if you think about starving people, that&#39;s just a hindrance.
We have to find the best solution. The best way to combat poverty is to understand that Conservatives need progress and understand the Liberals&#39; obsession with poverty, and that Progressives need Conservatives and understand their obsession with free markets.
That is the diversity that will make this country stronger in the future. If we make it happen.
What should I do? How can we do it together?
Here is a code of conduct for you and me.
first. First action: Remember, it is not enough to tolerate naysayers.
That&#39;s not all.
We also need to know that we need people who have different opinions than us. Because those are the people who need our solutions.
What are you going to do next? How are you going to run it?
Where do I start? This is right here.
All of us here are blessed.
Because there is someone who listens to us.
We are blessed with prosperity and we are blessed with leadership.
When people hear us talk about unpredictable ideas, they&#39;ll probably listen.
From there, progress begins.
That&#39;s the first one.
Second: I ask you and myself whether it is possible to become such an ambiguous and inexplicable person who will break down the boundaries of difference.
If you are a conservative, be a hero to the poor, a conservative who always talks about poverty and moral obligation.
And if you are a progressive, remain a progressive who debates how to solve problems through the advantages of free markets.
If that happens, we have two benefits.
Number one: It will solve the problem of the next two billion people. The solutions we see in the past must also be visible in the future.
Second, the conflict of ideologies that this country is experiencing can be transformed into a competition of ideas through mutual respect.
And maybe you&#39;ll find that the difference isn&#39;t that big.
thank you
When I was in college, I majored in political science. So there were a lot of assignments to write.
The average student will divide the work like this when doing an assignment.
You all know. It starts out a little slow, but if you do enough in the first week, you&#39;ll do more later and things will get done methodically.
I want to do that too.
That&#39;s how you plan it.
Everything will be ready. But in fact, when the assignment comes, this is what happens.
This happened with every assignment.
A 90-page graduation thesis has also arrived. It was a thesis that required an investment of one year.
I knew that I couldn&#39;t do this assignment the way I normally do.
It&#39;s too important a task to do that.
So I made a plan and thought, this is what I should do.
This is how you spend a year.
Start slowly at first, increase the speed in the middle, and become more energetic at the end. It&#39;s like a small staircase for a month.
How hard can it be to climb some stairs?
It&#39;s no big deal, is it?
But then something really funny happened.
the first few months
Time just passed by and I didn&#39;t do much.
So, we came up with an awesome revised plan.
But then the intervening months just passed by and I didn’t write anything. So it happened like this.
Two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks.
And then one day I woke up and there were only 3 days left until the deadline and I hadn&#39;t written a single word. So I did what I could. I wrote 90 pages in 72 hours. I stayed up all night, not just one day, but two nights. If you&#39;re human, you shouldn&#39;t stay up for two nights. Then I ran across campus and dived in slow motion just to make it on time.
I thought that was the end of it.
But a week later, I got a call from school.
“Are you Team Urban?” When asked
I said, “Yes.” I did.
“I need to talk about my thesis.” He said so.
I said, “Do it.” I did.
This is what happens at school. “This is the best paper I’ve ever seen.”
That didn&#39;t happen.
It was a very, very bad paper.
I just wanted to enjoy a little moment where you think like this. “This guy is amazing!”
No, no, it really sucked.
Anyway, currently I am a blog writer.
I run a blog called “Wait a minute, but why?”
A few years ago, I tried to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always perplexed people around me who don&#39;t procrastinate. I wanted to explain to them. What goes on in the minds of procrastinators and why we procrastinate.
I had a hypothesis. The brains of people who procrastinate are different from other people&#39;s brains.
To test this, I went to an MRI lab and had them scan both my brains, as well as the brains of proven non-procrastinators, and compared the two.
I brought it to you today to show you.
Please look closely to see the difference.
Unless you&#39;re a trained brain expert, the difference may not be obvious, but take a look anyway.
This is the brain of someone who doesn&#39;t procrastinate.
now...
This is my brain.
There is a difference.
Both have a “rational decision maker,” but procrastinators also have an “instant gratification monkey” in their brains.
What does this mean for procrastinators?
I mean everything was fine until this happened.
[It would be best to do it now.] [No!] A rational decision maker will make a rational decision to do something productive. But the monkey doesn&#39;t like that, so he takes the wheel and says, “Let’s read the entire Wikipedia page on the Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding scandal, because it just occurred to me. Then, let’s go to the refrigerator and see if there’s anything new from 10 minutes ago.
Then, I go to YouTube and start with a video of Richard Feynman explaining magnets, spend a while, and finally watch a video interviewing Justin Bieber&#39;s mom.
This all takes a lot of time, so I don&#39;t have time to do anything today.
sorry!&quot;
What is going on?
The Instant Gratification Monkey is not the kind of kid you want to let behind the wheel.
He lives entirely in the present moment.
It has no memory of the past or knowledge of the future, and only cares about two things. Something easy and fun.
In the animal world, that would be okay.
If you are a puppy and spend your whole life doing only easy and fun things, you will have a successful life!
To these monkeys, humans are just another species of animal.
All you have to do is sleep well, eat well, and reproduce well. In the tribal era, that would have been enough.
I don&#39;t know if you know this, but we are no longer in the era of shortages.
Now is the era of advanced civilization, but monkeys don&#39;t know what that is.
That is why there is another entity in our brain. It&#39;s a &quot;rational decision maker,&quot; and it gives us the ability to do things that animals can&#39;t.
You can dream of the future,
You can see the big picture,
You can also make long-term plans.
Rational decision makers try to take all of this into account.
You want to make sure that you do what makes sense in the moment. Sometimes doing something easy and fun is
There are times when it is appropriate. When you have dinner, sleep, or have some quality leisure time. So there is some overlap.
Sometimes we agree.
But sometimes it makes more sense to work even if it&#39;s hard and not very enjoyable. For a greater purpose.
That&#39;s when conflict arises.
For procrastinators, such conflicts always end the same way. You spend a lot of time in this orange zone, the easy and fun kingdom outside the realm of rationality.
I call it the “Dark Playground.”
The dark playground is a place everyone who procrastinates knows well.
It is a place where leisure activities take place, sometimes even when they should not.
The fun in the dark playground isn&#39;t actually fun. Because you don&#39;t deserve to play. The air there is full of guilt, fear, anxiety, and self-loathing, all feelings experienced by procrastinators.
The problem is that if monkeys dominate in this situation, how do procrastinators get to the blue zone? This is where less enjoyable but important things happen.
Fortunately, people who procrastinate have a guardian angel. The entity that always looks down on him and protects him in his darkest moments is the Panic Monster.
The panic monster is dormant most of the time, but suddenly awakens when a deadline looms, public embarrassment, career disaster, or the risk of dire consequences.
The important thing is that it&#39;s the only thing the monkey is afraid of.
Until recently, he was a very close presence in my life. TED contacted me six months ago and invited me to a lecture.
Of course, I said I would do it.
I always had a dream of giving a TED talk.
However, while I was excited for a while, it seems that the rational decision maker had other thoughts.
He said, “You know what we accepted, right?
You clearly understand what will happen one day in the future, right?
“You need to sit down and start right now.”
The monkey then said, &quot;I totally agree, but for now, let&#39;s just open Google Earth and to get to know India better, let&#39;s zoom in on the southern tip of India and scroll up for two and a half hours until we reach the northern tip of India at 200 feet above sea level.&quot; It is said.
So that&#39;s what I did that day.
6 months turned into 4 months, then 2 months, then 1 month, a TED official announced a speaker.
When I opened the website, my face was looking straight at me.
Then who woke up?
So the panic monster starts to lose its mind. After a few seconds, all systems went crazy.
Then the monkey, scared of the panic monster, runs up the tree!
Then, finally, a rational decision-maker was able to take the initiative and work on the lecture.
The panic monster explains the behavior of crazy people who procrastinate. How can people like me, who couldn&#39;t even write the first sentence of an assignment in two weeks, miraculously find the work ethic to stay up all night writing eight pages?
All of these situations are explained by three characters. This is the procrastinator&#39;s system.
It doesn&#39;t look very nice, but it works in the end.
So I wrote a blog about this a few years ago.
When I wrote it, people&#39;s reactions were amazing.
Literally thousands of emails were sent from all over the world, from different people doing different things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and tons of PhD students.
They all said the same thing. “I have the same problem.”
But what surprised me was the light tone of the blog post, which contrasted with the very serious tone of the email.
These people were really frustrated and talking about what their lives had become because of procrastination. What did the monkey do to him?
I looked at this and thought: The procrastinator&#39;s system works, so why does this happen?
Why are all these people in such a dark place?
It turns out there are two types of procrastination.
All of the examples I mentioned today had deadlines. When there is a deadline
The consequences of procrastination are limited to the short term. Because the panic monster is involved.
But the second type of procrastination occurs when there is no deadline.
If you want to pursue self-employment, such as art or business, there is no deadline for this. Because nothing happens until you step up and do the work. Outside of your job, there are many important things that don&#39;t have any deadlines.
Things like meeting family, exercising, taking care of your health, maintaining good relationships, and ending relationships that aren&#39;t working well. If the only mechanism that can cause procrastinators to do these difficult tasks is the panic monster, then that&#39;s a problem. Because there&#39;s no deadline for all of this, so the panic monster doesn&#39;t show up. There is no reason to wake up.
So the consequences of procrastination are not limited and just go on forever.
This is long-term procrastination, which is much less visible and discussed than the ridiculous, short-term, deadline type. I usually suffer quietly and alone.
This can be a source of considerable long-term unhappiness and regret. I think that&#39;s why people sent emails.
This is why they are in a very bad situation. It&#39;s not because they crammed their assignments.
Long-term procrastination is like putting yourself out there.
It&#39;s because it sometimes makes you feel like a spectator of your own life. Frustration is not because you can&#39;t achieve your dream.
Because I couldn’t even start toward my dream. So, after reading these emails, I gained some insight. I don&#39;t think there is a person who doesn&#39;t procrastinate.
you&#39;re right. You are all procrastinators too.
Well, maybe you&#39;re not as messed up as we are. You may have a healthy relationship with a deadline, but remember, the Monkey&#39;s clever tricks come when there are no deadlines.
I&#39;d like to show you one last thing.
I call this the life calendar.
There is a box for each week of my 90 years of life.
There aren&#39;t that many boxes. Especially since we&#39;ve already used a lot of boxes.
I think we need to look at this calendar carefully for a long time.
We need to think about what we are actually putting off. Everyone is putting off something in their life.
We must always be aware of the instant gratification monkey.
That&#39;s what we all need to do.
There aren&#39;t many boxes left on the calendar, so you should probably start today.
Well, even if it&#39;s not today...
what,
Someday soon.
thank you
That day, we, souls and bodies, gathered in a Texas church and were spending the last days of our lives.
It was similar to the room we&#39;re in here, but with creaky wooden chairs draped in old red cloth, the organ to my left and the choir behind me. A baptismal bath was mounted on the wall behind the choir.
Even so, it was similar to this place.
Just like here, there was tension, hope for salvation, hands were sweating, and the people sitting in the back were not paying attention.
This was December 31, 1999, the night of Jesus&#39; Second Coming, and I knew it was the day the world ended.
I turned 12 that year, and I was at an age where I felt responsible.
And as soon as I was old enough to take responsibility for what I had done, it occurred to me that I might as well stop complaining about how unfair it was for Jesus to come again and get my house in order real quick.
So I went to church as often as possible.
I listened to silence as hard as people listen to sounds, to make sure that God didn&#39;t take me first. And I decided to go home early.
Even if Jesus had returned, I prepared for an alternative by reading “The Leftovers,” which was popular at the time.
The book said I had a chance if I didn&#39;t fall into the ecstasy of the Second Coming at midnight.
To do this, I had to avoid receiving the mark of the beast and fight against the devil, pestilence, and the Antichrist.
It must have been difficult. But I believed I could do it.
But the time for planning is over.
The clock showed 11:50.
There were 10 minutes left until the Second Coming and the pastor called us to come out of our chairs and onto the altar. Because I wanted to be praying when midnight came.
So all the believers gathered and took their seats.
The choir remained in the choir, and the priest and his wives, as I like to call them, the Baptist bourgeoisie, sat at the head of the foundation.
In the United States, VIP seating is also available on Advent Day.
And right behind the Baptist bourgeoisie were the elders. The hot sun of East Texas&#39; cotton plantations bent their backs in their youth, scorched their noble, wrinkle-free brown skin like East Texas mud, and their hopes and dreams of what life would be like outside of East Texas sometimes outweighed their bent waists. People who are more bent and broken.
These seniors were the main characters of the day for me.
They have waited their whole lives for this moment. Just like our medieval ancestors hoped for the end of the world. And just like my grandmother waits for the Oprah Winfrey show every day at 4 o&#39;clock on channel 8.
When my grandmother headed to the foundation, I followed closely behind her. I definitely believed that my grandmother would go to heaven, and if I held her hand while praying,
I thought I could go with you. So I held his hand and closed my eyes. To listen and wait.
The prayers grew louder and the cries of answers to prayers
It was getting louder and louder.
Here, the organ was adding a dirge.
The heat increased with sweat.
I clenched my hands to keep from falling and being left alone.
I closed my eyes tighter and tried not to watch people fall away.
And a voice rang out over us as we prayed. &quot;amen&quot;
It&#39;s over.
I looked at the clock
It was already past midnight.
I looked at the elders. Their savior never came. They could not bear to show their disappointment, but they had believed so much and for so long that they were now beginning to doubt.
I was angry to see them in their situation.
They have been deceived, blindsided, and bullied all this time. And I have been right next to them.
I prayed for them and tried not to fall into temptation.
I dipped my head into that snotty baptismal bath not once, but twice.
I sincerely believed it.
What should I do now?
When I got home and turned on the TV, I happened to see Peter Jennings announcing the new millennium. Going around the world.
Here, a sudden thought occurred to me that it was strange that Jesus traveled around the world and returned at different times.
This made me even more ridiculous and it really hurt me.
But I didn&#39;t lose faith that day.
I just started believing in new things. That it is possible not to believe.
My answer may be wrong or the problem itself may be wrong.
And confidence, once as great as a mountain, has flowed down to its source. It was a well of doubt. A spring that promised a river.
I go back my entire life and vividly remember that night in church when my Savior did not appear. The day I learned that what I most believed in turned out to be, if not a lie, not the truth.
Most of you may have faced Y2K differently, but I&#39;m sure the reason you&#39;re here to see me talk is because some of you experienced the same thing I did. Since the beginning of the new millennium, since my mother left and my father became distant, and since the Savior did not appear.
I held hands and desperately searched for a place to rest my heart.
I entered Yale University when I was 18. With the faith I was raised in Oak Cliff Texas. It was an opportunity to leave behind the countless trials I had gone through and the sight of my body and mind being broken.
But when I came home one winter break, what I found was my face on the floor, my hands tied behind my back, and the robber&#39;s gun pointed at my head. At this time, I learned that no matter how much I studied, I could not be saved.
I also had faith in Lehman Brothers, where I worked as an intern in 2008.
Full of hope, I called my family and told them that we would no longer be poor.
But after watching this temple of finance crumble before my eyes, I knew that even the best job couldn&#39;t save me.
I developed my faith while working as a young employee in Washington, DC. My belief came from Illinois, where I said, &quot;It was very hard to get here, but this election will change America.&quot; It was because I heard a voice saying,
But when the National Assembly failed to function properly and the entire country fell apart, I realized that hope and change felt like a cruel joke, and that even the second coming of a political savior could not save me.
I knelt before the altar of the American Dream and prayed to the God of this age. To the god of success, money, and power.
But again and again, I would wake up in the middle of the night and see that all these gods were dead.
In despair, I began searching once again. Not because I was brave, but because I knew I was at a crossroads between believing and dying.
So I went on a pilgrimage to another holy place. At Harvard Business School. This time, I knew I couldn’t just accept the salvation that was claimed to be true.
But I knew I had more work to do.
It started with a question that three friends and I had late on a miserable early winter night in Cambridge, in a dark corner of a crowded party. There is something young people seeking the truth have been asking for a long time. “What if we take a car and go on a trip?”
We didn&#39;t know where or how to go, but we had to go.
Because all our lives we&#39;ve longed for a life of &quot;sneaking out at night and disappearing somewhere,&quot; as in Jack Kerouac&#39;s novel, and we&#39;ve tried to find out how people live across the country.
So even though others said the risks were too high and the evidence was weak, we left anyway.
In the summer of 2013, I traveled 8,000 miles across the United States. Through the rangelands of Montana, through the badlands of Detroit, across the swamps of New Orleans, I worked with the people there. They were people who achieved the basics of life through small businesses.
And as someone steeped in Western capitalism, I was shocked by this innovation.
And this idea grew and developed into a non-profit foundation, MBAs Across America. This is the exercise that got me standing here today.
This movement spread because our generation has a deep yearning for purpose and meaning.
This movement has spread because so many entrepreneurs are creating jobs and changing lives across America and need a little help.
But to be honest, this movement has spread because I fought for it.
I tried to go anywhere to spread this gospel. So that more people will believe that we can stitch this torn country together, one social enterprise at a time.
But my journey to spread this gospel led me to another gospel. This is the gospel I want to share with you today.
One evening about a year ago, there was a Harvard Business School alumni event at the Museum of Natural History in New York.
There was a life-size model of a whale there. I was sitting down there with some of the biggest names of our time, and they were celebrating their peers and their achievements.
The place was full of pride. This is because the net assets and assets operated under its management exceeded $500 billion.
It was great to see what we had achieved together.
But something else happened two days later. I went to Harlem to preach the gospel. There, sitting on an urban farm that was once an empty lot, I listened to a man named Tony tell me about the children who come there every day.
All of these children were living in extreme poverty.
Many children carried everything they had in bags. So as not to lose it in a homeless shelter.
Some of them participate in Tony&#39;s &#39;Harlem Grown&#39; and get their only meal of the day.
Tony said he started &#39;Harlem Grown&#39; with his pension money. The pension I received after driving a taxi for 20 years.
He said he invested his pension money because the program was successful but needed support.
He said he would be happy to receive any help.
And I helped with that.
But as I parted ways with Tony, I felt stinging and tears welling up in my eyes.
I felt the weight of revelation. The revelation that one day you&#39;re in a room with hundreds of people with $500 billion, and two days later you&#39;re in another room 50 blocks away watching someone give up their pension to feed their child.
I didn&#39;t shed tears because of the stark inequality. I didn&#39;t shed tears thinking about the hungry children wandering the streets. It&#39;s not anger towards the top 1% or sympathy for the other 99%.
The reason I was heartbroken was because I realized that I was just a dialysis machine in this country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that my story was speaking on behalf of people who don&#39;t have boots and are encouraged to lace up their boots. The organization I run was providing structural and systemic help that did not reach Harlem, Appalachia, or New Orleans, and I felt that my voice was replacing the voices of people who were uneducated, uneducated, and had no place to live.
And I started to feel ashamed about it. It was the same shame I felt as I sat in front of the TV and watched Peter Jennings shout out the new millennium again and again.
I felt deceived, blindsided, and confused.
But this time the false savior was me.
You see, I&#39;ve come a long way from that altar that night when I thought the world was going to end. In a world where people said that suffering was a necessary act of God and that what the Bible said was absolutely true.
Yes, after a long way around I am back where I started.
Because we cannot simply say that we live in an age of disbelief. Today we have as much faith as countless people before us.
Some of us may believe the prophecies of Brené Brown or Tony Robbins.
Some of us may believe the &#39;New Yorker&#39; or &#39;Harvard Business Review&#39; as the Bible.
We may believe it most deeply when we gather here at TED Church for worship. But we desperately want to believe and must believe.
We promise to solve all our problems like charismatic leaders do.
We see suffering as a necessary evil of the capitalism we believe in, and we accept technological advancement as an irrefutable truth.
And we rarely realize the human price we pay when we fail to ask this small question. Because we fear it will shake our entire foundation.
But if you are heartbroken by the absurdities we have come to accept, it may be time to question.
I&#39;m not talking about disruption or reform or the gospel of new corporate performance measurement principles.
Actually, I did not come today to preach the gospel of faith to you.
I have come to preach the gospel of doubt.
The gospel of doubt does not tell you not to believe. Instead, I am telling you to believe in something new. That it is possible not to believe.
Our answers may be wrong and those who believe them may be wrong.
That&#39;s right. The gospel of doubt is that all of us here could be wrong.
Because this gospel raises the question, “Why?”
The question we asked with all our hearts and hands together: Why do people still suffer like this?
This doubt led to the closure of my organization, MBAs Across America.
We&#39;re letting go of our employees, closing our doors, and sharing our business model for free. So that anyone with the ability to do this can do it without our permission.
These doubts have led some people to abandon the role of savior that they have entrusted to me. Because our lives are too short and too unlikely to wait for the return of the Savior. In fact, there are no miracles in this world.
And this doubt will give me strength and hope. When we are consumed with anxiety, when the path before us seems to lead us to our end, when our healers can no longer heal our wounds, let our humble doubts, not our blind faith, take over our lives and If we raise our voices and whisper as a small light in the darkness of this world,
It will make you shout or simply say: Quite simply, “There must be another way.”
thank you
difficulty of obtaining food
It appears in the news every day.
What&#39;s the problem?
There are places in the world where there is a shortage of food, and where there is too much.
Somewhere GMOs are saving the world.
Maybe GMOs are the problem?
Excessive agricultural wastewater pollutes the ocean. Soil nutrients are decreasing
The vicious cycle continues.
And when I see this phenomenon, I feel very discouraged.
How can we feel this situation with our own skin?
How can this apple cause a food shortage?
You&#39;ve probably eaten at least an apple recently.
How long do you think it has been since you picked this apple?
2 weeks?
2 months?
11 months. This is the average age of apples sold in supermarkets in the United States.
The situation will not be much different in any other part of the world. Then chemicals are added. There are real cases where lives have been lost. This is because the chemicals used in the process of slowing down the deterioration of apples are harmful to the human body. How does no one know about this?
Why didn&#39;t I know?
By the time we eat these apples, they have lost about 90% of their nutrients, including antioxidant enzymes.
This apple is just a lump of sugar.
How can there be such a lack of information? How can we do better?
What we lack is a platform.
Platforms and computers connected me to the internet as a child.
A lot of strange things have been done on this platform. Thanks to this, I was able to meet people and express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a platform, we would be able to ask questions autonomously. if?
I asked this question: What if climates were equal?
This is a map showing the world&#39;s climate.
The most productive areas are green and the opposite is red.
The climate changes. California farmers are now Mexican farmers.
China wants to purchase land in Brazil to grow high-quality food. We are very dependent on climate.
What if every country could have an optimal climate?
How will it change our lives?
What impact will this have on quality of life and food quality?
The food crisis of previous generations was due to the need for cheaper and more abundant food.
Welcome to International Farm.
We built a big analog farm.
The lines shown above are transport routes for cars, planes, trains, etc.
It is a miracle that only a small minority of society can participate in agriculture to feed 7 billion people.
But what if… .
What if you build a digital international farm?
What if this apple could be digitized using some technology, transmitted through the air, and reconstructed on the other side of the Earth?
if?
The following quotes inspire what I do.
First: [&quot;Japan&#39;s agriculture has no water, no land, no young blood, and no future.&quot;] This is an uncomfortable truth I faced upon arriving in Minamisanriku, at the southern tip of Fukushima, after the catastrophe.
Young people headed to Sendai and Tokyo, where the land was polluted and about 70% of the food was foreign.
However, this phenomenon is not limited to Japan.
Only 2% of Americans are involved in agriculture.
How can 2% of the population take action?
Other regions are no better. 50% of Africa&#39;s population is under 18 years of age.
80% do not want to be farmers.
Farming is hard.
The lives of small farmers are miserable.
Young people are moving into cities.
In India, members of farming families are not guaranteed even the bare minimum infrastructure. In the past 10 years, the suicide rate among farmers has been higher than ever.
This is an uncomfortable truth to even talk about.
Where are people heading?
It&#39;s a city.
There are no young people on the farm.
How can we make this platform move young people?
This is a new tractor.
This is my harvest season.
A few years ago I stopped by Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot and started making things.
I made stupid things, made plants dance, and connected them to my computer to kill them all. Killed several times.
Then I developed the most intimate relationship of my life with plants. Because I was learning their language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
“We have an old electronics lab here that no one wants.
I received the reply, “Please try to use it well.”
My team and I built a farm in it. In a place that has nothing to do with biology. Within this 18.3 square meters
Although it&#39;s not a lot, we produced enough to serve one meal to 300 people each month. It&#39;s loaded with interesting technologies.
The most interesting part?
Beautiful pure white roots, dark green leaves, and a harvest cycle of just one month.
Is this the new cafeteria?
Is this a new retail experience?
Is this a new supermarket?
One thing can be said for sure. The Media Lab guys were the first to uproot something.
It&#39;s not that strange since I just ate the salad in the bag.
If you&#39;re uprooted with image-based processing experts, data scientists, and roboticists, this is what you&#39;ll think of each other. “Hmm. Maybe I can contribute to this field.
no. “I want to try it.” Meanwhile, we took some of the plants back to the lab, because what you grow is precious and you can’t just throw it away.
I have developed a delicate sense of taste. Because I want my plants to taste delicious.
This is because we eat lettuce before everyone else every day. Now you can adjust the pH of lettuce to within 0.1 just by tasting it.
“This has a pH of 6.1. I can’t eat it today.”
This lettuce was very sweet.
This is because the plant is stressed and triggers a chemical reaction to protect itself. “I won’t die!”
The resistance of plants to survive just feels sweet to me.
Instead of relying on the latest technology, we went back to plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to try this too.
I want to see limitless imagination. So, we came up with a laboratory that could be shipped anywhere and put it into practice.
The front of this media lab is my laboratory. As many as 30 sensors are used per plant.
If you know genome or genetics, isn&#39;t this the phenome?
a phenomenon
If you claim that “strawberries from Mexico are good,” it would be more accurate to say that strawberries grown in that climate are good.
If you can code the climate, this amount of CO2 and O2 is just the right prescription. It would be coding the nutrition, climate, size, shape, color, and texture of the plants you want to grow.
To do this, we need data to analyze what&#39;s happening, which is why we&#39;ve installed a lot of sensors.
Take a look at your plants. “Why are you dying? Why can’t you speak!?”
You will feel sad like this. The farmer will have the most beautiful prophetic eyes.
As they enter their 60s and 70s, they wonder if it is nitrogen deficiency or calcium deficiency just by looking at a wilting plant.
You can tell if more humidity is needed.
That wisdom is not being passed down to future generations.
This is a new look at the cloud environment.
We look for trends in data collected over time and find associations with individual plants.
These numbers are the IP addresses of all the broccoli served on buffet day.
Now, the era has come where even broccoli has an IP address.
If you&#39;re ready to be even more amazed, click to see the plant&#39;s profile.
It shows the growth rate of the plant. But it doesn&#39;t just show when it&#39;s ripe.
Have I achieved my desired nutritional requirements?
When will you get the taste you want?
Are you drinking too much water?
Are you getting too much sunlight?
Alert about all this. Plants speak to me.
Our own language emerged.
Are you the first user of Plant Facebook? That plant will start making friends.
I&#39;m serious. That plant will make friends with plants that need less nitrogen and potassium but more phosphorus.
You&#39;ll learn about complex connections that we can only guess at now. The results will vary depending on what we do.
This is what my lab currently looks like.
We have some structure now. I know a little bit about controlled environments thanks to my background designing healthcare data centers.
So we are trying various experiments in this environment.
This atomization process was also developed by NASA to reduce the amount of water sent to the Mir space station.
Through this process, we can provide plants with what they want at the right time. water, mineral resources and oxygen
Roots aren&#39;t that tricky. As long as you meet those requirements, you will see a beautiful response.
It&#39;s like having two hearts.
That&#39;s why they grow four or five times faster.
It&#39;s the perfect environment.
We have been developing seeds to overcome adverse environments for a long time. That effort will continue. But we also have a new weapon: a flawless environment. These are the plants we tried.
This is a tomato that hasn&#39;t been grown commercially in 150 years.
Do you know of a seed bank that stores all kinds of seeds?
seed bank
It&#39;s an amazing place.
A variety of germplasm is preserved there, and there are many that I have never tried before.
I&#39;m probably the only person in this room who&#39;s ever eaten tomatoes like that.
The problem is that these tomatoes are for sauce, and we can&#39;t cook them. I did the next best thing and ate it raw and it was just so-so.
We&#39;ve also grown a variety of things through protein modification.
I also raised people. Of course, that wasn&#39;t really the case.
What we realized during the experiment was that this device was too big and expensive.
Each unit costs approximately $100,000 to install in various locations around the world.
Not many people have $100,000 to spend at any given time. So we wanted to make it smaller.
This project actually belongs to my undergraduate student Camille, who is majoring in mechanical engineering. So Camille and my team spent the summer thinking about how we could make it cheaper, better, and easier to make.
The machines were then installed in 7th to 11th grade classes in several schools.
If you want to feel humble, try teaching your children.
One time, I made a request to the students. “Set the humidity to 65%.”
A 7th grade student asked again. “What is humidity?”
“Humidity is the water in the air.”
“There can be water in the air! You stupid man.”
So I advised: “Okay, don’t believe me.”
What else do you have to believe in me?
Set the humidity to 100.
What happened when the child changed the settings?
The gas condenses, forming water vapor, and eventually water droplets fall.
Then the child says: “Ah! The humidity is rain.”
“Why didn’t you tell me that?”
The interface we created is similar to an online game.
Users can access the 3D environment from anywhere in the world. It is also available on smartphones and tablets.
The user coordinates the physical environment and sensors of this mechanical garden.
You can choose from cultivation methods created by other children around the world.
Then activate the cultivation method and plant the seeds.
Changes may be made while the seed is growing.
“Why do you need carbon dioxide? Isn’t it bad for your health because it kills people?”
They can kill plants by raising carbon dioxide levels significantly.
You can lower the level to help plants grow better.
Once you&#39;ve grown your plants, your new digital growing method is complete.
This process is a continuation of development and exploration. And users can
Digital cultivation instructions and data are available for download. You can also compare whether it has improved compared to before. All of this is just getting started. We&#39;re going to learn so much.
This is the ‘food computer’. Three weeks passed at each school.
This is how it has grown over time.
But more importantly, it gave this child his first idea. ‘I could become a farmer too’ or ‘I want to become a farmer.’
We open sourced all of this.
All the contents are available on the web, so try making it when you have time.
It won&#39;t be easy.
We&#39;ve only just begun
Making it easier for everyone to participate is very important to me.
We&#39;ll make it easier.
These are farmers. Electronics Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Environmental Engineer, Computer Scientist Plant Scientist, Economist, Urban Designer
Let&#39;s all do what we&#39;re good at on one platform.
Then it got too big.
This is a new facility where I just started.
It can be installed anywhere in the world.
That&#39;s why I chose this method.
In this warehouse, we&#39;re going to make things like this.
These things already exist.
These already exist too.
The first is plants
The second facility grows the Ebola vaccine.
The winning entry from the Darpa Grand Challenge and the plants you just saw are one of the reasons why humanity is ahead of the Ebola virus.
These plants produce a protein that makes them resistant to Ebola.
Pharmaceuticals, medicinal foods and lettuce
As these two seem completely different, in the field I work in,
Everything is different.
This field is like, “Is this good enough?” We are at the stage of settling down. A small fight breaks out and they show off their products to each other. “Mine also includes extremely valuable intellectual property.
Instead of that, buy mine.”
But the reality is, we are just getting started.
It is also a time when society is changing rapidly. In the past, food was cheap and plentiful.
Now we need quality, eco-friendly food. It wouldn&#39;t be surprising if it ranked first among the world&#39;s most mysterious foods.
We&#39;ve entered the era of advertising what McDonald&#39;s Chicken McNuggets are made of. Everything is changing.

thank you
Sometimes I feel really embarrassed as a European.
Last year, millions of people arrived in Europe in need of our help. And our response was frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
As we mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Cuddy, more than 200 children continued to drown in the Mediterranean Sea.
We have an international treaty that recognizes refugees as a shared responsibility. And yet we have accepted that little Lebanon hosts more Syrians than any European country.
We mourn the existence of human smugglers. But we are making it the only way to get asylum in Europe.
We are experiencing a labor shortage. But we are blocking the people we need for our economy and our population from coming to Europe.
We are asserting the value of freedom against Islamic fundamentalism. But we have a coercive policy. They are detaining children seeking asylum, separating them from their families, and confiscating refugees&#39; property.
What are we doing?
How did things get to this point? Why do we confront this humanitarian crisis so inhumanely?
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s because people aren&#39;t interested. Or at least I don&#39;t want to believe that.
I think it&#39;s because our politicians have no vision. There is no vision of how to apply the international refugee system created 50 years ago to a changing and globalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very fundamental questions, questions that we all need to answer.
First, why doesn&#39;t the current system work?
Second, what should we do to fix this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of World War II. By these people.
The fundamental goal of this is assurance: when a state fails, or worse, turns against its own people, people have a place to go and live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It was created precisely for situations like Syria today.
An international agreement signed by 147 governments, including the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and the international organization UNHCR, provides for the reciprocal reception in their territories of people fleeing physical conflict and abuse.
But today that system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
In reality, our immigration policies are blocking our path to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to be accepted or returned to their country.
But in reality, they are stuck in an uncertain situation with no end in sight.
In theory, refugees are a shared global responsibility.
In fact, demographics show that countries close to conflict zones host an overwhelming majority of the world&#39;s refugees.
This system is not broken because the rules are wrong.
This is because we have not been able to properly apply it to a changing world. And this is exactly what we need to rethink.
So let me give you a quick overview of how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
I will speak from the perspective of refugees, not from the institutional perspective seen from above.
Consider a Syrian woman.
Let&#39;s call her Amira.
To me, Amira symbolizes the many people I met in that area.
Amira, like about 25% of the world&#39;s refugees, is a woman with children. And she can&#39;t go home. Because it&#39;s from this city. As you can see on the screen, Homs, once a beautiful and historic city, is now covered in rubble.
So Amira cannot go back.
But Amira cannot hope to resettle in a third country. Because it is a lottery that is only available to less than 1% of the world&#39;s refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three options.
The first option is to take the family to a camp.
Although help may be available in the camp, there is little hope for Amira and her family.
The camp is located in a barren, dry, almost desert area.
From the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, the sound of shells from across the Syrian border can be heard at night.
Economic activity is limited,
The quality of education is also low.
And around 80% of refugees living in camps around the world end up staying there for at least five years.
It&#39;s a truly miserable life, and may be the reason why only 9% of Syrians actually choose the camps.
Instead, Amira could head to urban areas in neighboring countries such as Aman and Beirut.
This is already the option chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
But there are also enormous difficulties.
Refugees usually do not have the right to work in such urban areas.
There is no special way to get help.
So Amira and her family spend all their remaining money and face a life of little or poverty.
So there is a third alternative, one that many Syrians have been taking recently.
Amira is willing to risk her life on a very dangerous and difficult journey to another country for her family. This is what we see in Europe today.
The world is forcing refugees into three nearly impossible choices: Camp life, urban poverty, and dangerous travel
For refugees, that choice is today&#39;s global refugee relief package.
But I think this is the wrong choice.
I think we need to rethink this choice.
The reason we limit options is because we think those are the only options available to refugees, but that&#39;s not true.
Politicians are characterizing this as a zero-sum issue. In other words, providing benefits to refugees will impose costs on citizens.
We seem to regard refugees as an inevitable cost or a burden on society.
But that&#39;s not the case. They too can contribute.
So what I want to argue is that there is a way to expand the options for refugees while also benefiting everyone. To all refugee-hosting countries and organizations, our society, and refugees.
And what I would like to propose are four ways to change the paradigm of how we treat refugees.
These four methods have one thing in common. It&#39;s all about leveraging the opportunities of globalization, liquidity and markets, and changing the way we think about the refugee problem.
The first thing I want you to think about is the provision environment. And this starts with the basic recognition that refugees are people like us. The perception that they are simply people in a special environment.
My colleagues and I at Oxford worked on a research project looking at the economic lives of refugees in Uganda.
The reason we chose Uganda is not because we represent the host country.
Uganda is quite exceptional.
What Uganda has done, unlike most host countries in the world, is provide economic opportunities for refugees.
It provided the right to work and freedom of movement.
And the consequences have been devastating for both refugees and society.
In the capital, Kampala, we saw that 21% of refugees were running businesses that employed other people, and 40% of their employees were Ugandans.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs. To the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps we found exceptional cases of vibrant, thriving entrepreneurial businesses.
For example, we saw the case of a Congolese refugee who runs a digital music business in a settlement called Naqivale.
Additionally, a Rwandan refugee was running a business where children could play computer games using recycled TVs and game consoles.
In the face of extreme restrictions, refugees were innovating. This gentleman in front of you is a Congolese man called Demokei.
Demokay wanted to become a film producer even though he came to his residence almost empty-handed.
So I started a local radio station with friends and colleagues, rented a video camera, and now I&#39;m making movies.
He created two documentaries for our team and created a successful business from almost nothing.
This is an example that could change our response to refugees.
Refugees should not be seen as merely dependent on humanitarian aid, but should be given opportunities to thrive as human beings.
Of course, clothing, blankets, shelter, and food are all very important in an emergency situation. But we need to look beyond that.
We need to give them a chance. Direct connection, electricity, education, right to work, capital and finance.
Everything we take for granted in the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second thing I want to discuss is economic zones.
Unfortunately, not all host countries in the world are taking the same steps as Uganda.
Most host countries do not open their economies to refugees.
But there are still practical alternatives we can choose.
Last April, my colleague and I visited Jordan. I came up with the idea while I was there with development economist Paul Corriller. with international communities and governments. Supporting Jordan&#39;s national development strategy that provides jobs for Syrians
The idea is for an economic zone that could potentially integrate refugee employment with that of the host country, Jordan.
Home to 83,000 refugees, just 15 minutes from Zaatari refugee camp, is an existing economic zone called the King Hersen Bin Taral Development Zone.
The government spent more than $100 million to build an electricity grid and a road network. But two things were lacking. It was labor access and internal investment.
What if refugees had been able to work there, support their families and gain skills through job training rather than being stuck in camps? Until I returned to Syria.
It will benefit Jordan. This is because Jordan&#39;s development strategy calls for the country to become a middle-income country through manufacturing.
This would not only benefit refugees, but could also contribute to Syria&#39;s post-conflict recovery. This is through the recognition that we must embrace refugees as the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this idea in the Journal of Foreign Affairs,
King Abdullah adopted our idea.
It was announced at the London Syria Conference two weeks ago and is scheduled to be piloted this summer.
The third idea I would like to propose to you is to match preferences between countries and refugees, leading to happy results like the photo here of Chancellor Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees.
We rarely ask refugees what they want or where they want to go. But I would argue that we need to ask this and that this can benefit everyone.
Economics writer Alvin Ross developed the idea of matching markets. The preference ranking of the parties is ultimately how a match is achieved.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Titelboim explored whether the idea could also be applied to refugees. We asked refugees to rank their preferred destinations and matched them to countries based on skills and language.
Of course, some tolerance for diversity or vulnerability may be necessary here, but it is still a way to increase the likelihood of a match.
The matching idea is used in many places, for example in matching students with their university locations, in matching kidney recipients with patients, and even in algorithms on dating websites.
What if we applied this to the critical choices of refugees?
Of course, it can also be applied at the national level. The great challenge we face is persuading local communities to accept refugees.
And for example, in our country at the moment, we often send engineers and farmers to rural and urban areas. It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous.
Market matching is therefore both a way to ask for preferences and a potential way to adapt to the needs and demands of refugees as well as host countries.
The fourth ideal I would like to tell you about is humanitarian visas.
The vast majority of tragedies and chaos seen in Europe are largely preventable.
This stems from a fundamental contradiction in European asylum policy. That is to say, in order to seek asylum in Europe, one must voluntarily embark on the very dangerous journey I mentioned earlier.
But why should I take this trip? In this day and age of low-cost flights and modern projection capabilities.
It&#39;s truly unnecessary travel, and more than 3,000 people lost their lives on European borders and on European soil last year.
If refugees could travel directly to Europe and find asylum, we could have avoided it and done something about it through what are called humanitarian visas. People can obtain a visa from an embassy or consulate of a neighboring country, purchase a ship or plane ticket, and go to Europe.
To get from Turkey to the Greek islands through a smuggler, you will have to pay 1,000 euros.
It only costs 200 euros to get from Bodrum to Frankfurt.
Allowing refugees to do so would have clear advantages.
It would save lives, limit the smugglers&#39; market and eliminate the chaos we see on the front lines of Europe, such as the Greek islands.
What prevents us from doing so is politics, not rational solutions.
And here&#39;s the idea applied.
Brazil has taken a pioneering approach, issuing humanitarian visas to 2,000 Syrians, allowing them to enter Brazil and granting them refugee status.
Thanks to this system, all Syrians were granted refugee status and recognized as genuine refugees.
There is also historical precedent for this.
Between 1922 and 1942, Nansen passports were used for travel, allowing 450,000 Assyrians, Turks, and Chechens to travel to Europe and were granted refugee status anywhere in Europe.
And Nansen International Refugee Organization received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its effective strategy.
So the four ideas I mentioned are ways we can increase Amira&#39;s options.
This is a way to give refugees more choices. As I said, beyond the three very basic and almost impossible choices, this is a method that can benefit everyone.
In conclusion, we really need a new perspective. A vision that can increase refugees&#39; choices, a vision that eliminates the need to perceive refugees as a burden.
If you look at refugees as a cost, anything becomes possible.
Of course they are a humanitarian responsibility, but they are people with skills, talent, inspiration and the ability to contribute. Of course, if you help us do that.
In the new world, migration is not about leaving forever.
What we have seen in Europe will not last long.
People will continue to travel and find new places to settle, and we need to find a reasonable and realistic way to do this. It is not based on the old theory of humanitarian aid, nor is it based on the theory of charity, but on creating opportunities: globalization, markets and mobility.
I would like to urge all of you and your politicians to wake up to this challenge.
thank you so much.
When I was young, I used to dream about the sea.
The ocean was a wild world full of color and life, home to strange and fantastic creatures.
I photographed the large sharks that dominate the food chain and watched graceful sea turtles dance across the coral reef.
As a marine biologist turned photographer, I&#39;ve spent most of my professional life exploring the magical places I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I have been exposed to the world of water since I was quite young.
I was only 10 years old when I first went to the deep sea.
I still vividly remember frantically flipping to reach the old, hard cannon on the coral reef.
When I finally got my hands on the cannon, I looked up and realized I was surrounded by colorful, rainbow-colored fish.
That day I fell in love with the sea
[Thomas Peschak] [Conservation Photographer] During my 40 years on this planet, I have had the great privilege of exploring some of the most beautiful seascapes while working for National Geographic Monthly and the Save Our Seas Foundation.
I&#39;ve photographed many creatures, from very, very large sharks to cute sharks that fit in the palm of your hand.
I smelled the fishy breath of a humpback whale feeding in front of me in the cold waters off Canada&#39;s Great Bear Rainforest.
We also saw the mating ritual of green sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Every person on this planet affects and is affected by the ocean.
And the pristine sea that I dreamed of as a child is becoming more and more difficult to find.
They are increasingly pressured and threatened.
I personally witnessed and took photos of the ripple effects that we humans have had on nature while maintaining our position as the leading predator on the planet.
For a long time, I thought we had to show shocking pictures to break the audience out of their indifference.
Although this approach has its advantages, we are back to square one.
The best way to bring about change is to spread love.
Perhaps as a kind of matchmaker and photographer, I have the rare opportunity to reveal the animals and ecosystems hidden beneath the surface of the sea.
You can&#39;t love or defend something if you don&#39;t even know it exists.
Revealing the beauty of nature is the power of environmental photography.
I have visited hundreds of maritime locations, but only a few have impressed me so much.
The first time I was in such a state of ecstasy was about 10 years ago on the wild, rocky coast of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, giant sardines migrate north in a mass migration called the Sardine Run.
These fish have a good reason to run away.
They are chased by hordes of hungry, agile predators.
Common dolphins hunt together. They separate some sardines from the main school and form them into bait clumps.
Dolphins trap fish and lure them to the surface of the sea, where they feast on the fluttering feast.
A shark is chasing you from behind.
Many people think that sharks and dolphins are enemies, but they coexist in the Sardine Run.
In fact, dolphins help sharks prey more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait mass becomes more scattered and the sharks often fill themselves with what I call sardine donuts. Your mouth fills with water.
I&#39;ve had a few dangerous moments with sharks on the Sardine Run, but they don&#39;t see me as prey.
But at this noisy banquet, I get bumped and hit like no other guest.
From the coast of Africa we move east across the vast Indian Ocean to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral reef islands.
And during the stormy rainy season in the southwest, manta rays from across the archipelago migrate to a small spot on Baa Atoll called Hanifaru.
Clusters of crustaceans no bigger than the pupil of an eye are their main prey.
When plankton density decreases, they feed alone. They keep doing somersaults, like a puppy chasing its tail.
But as plankton density increases, manta rays form these long food chains. And it is obvious that prey that escapes the first or second manta ray will be eaten by the next manta ray.
When plankton levels peak in the bay, manta rays swim close together in an unusual behavior we call whirlpool feeding.
And while swimming in close formation, manta rays create their own eddies and suck plankton into their mouths.
The experience of swimming surrounded by a flock of manta rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Hanifaru, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like the Manta Foundation, my photos ultimately helped transform Hanifaru into a marine reserve.
Fishermen from neighboring islands hunted manta rays to make traditional drums from their shells.
Now they are the most ardent environmentalists. And the Maldivian economy receives more than $8 million a year from manta rays.
I&#39;ve always wanted to travel back in time to a time when maps were mostly blank or had &quot;Dragons Live&quot; written on them.
And the closest I have come to this experience so far was on a remote coral atoll in the western Indian Ocean.
Diving underwater, far from ocean lanes and fishing fleets, is a poignant reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Vasas da India. It is a small coral reef island located in the Mozambique Channel.
Corals form a protective outer barrier, and the inner lagoon is a larval nursery for Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I roughly guessed that sharks would be bolder at night.
I&#39;ve never seen so many sharks gathered on one coral reef before.
Capturing and sharing these moments reminds me why I chose this path.
Earlier this year I went to Baja California on an assignment for National Geographic magazine.
And about halfway from the Pacific side is San Ignacio Lagoon. This is an important birthing area for gray whales.
For a hundred years, this coast was the site of a massacre. More than 20,000 gray whales have died and only a few hundred remain.
The descendants of today&#39;s surviving whales push their calves to the surface to play and even interact with us.
This species has made a truly remarkable comeback.
On the other side of the peninsula is the sleepy fishing village of Cabo Pulmo.
Decades of overfishing have brought this village to the brink of collapse.
In 1995, local fishermen convinced officials to designate their coast a marine reserve.
But what happened since then was nothing short of a miracle.
In 2005, after just 10 years of protection, scientists witnessed the largest recovery of the fish in history.
But don&#39;t just take my word for it, come with me.
Let&#39;s swim together into the largest and densest school of fish I&#39;ve ever encountered.
We can all be creators of hope.
And through my photography, I want to convey the lesson that there is still hope in our oceans.
In particular, I want to draw attention to the resilience of nature in the face of 7.3 billion people.
My hope is that although it will be very difficult to take pictures like this in the future, I want to take pictures that show that we and the ocean coexist in mutual respect.
Hopefully, taking such photos will become a daily routine.
You have to be a huge optimist to survive and thrive as a marine photographer.
I always work with the belief that the next great photo that will make a difference is just around the corner. It might be behind the next coral you encounter, in the lagoon you next encounter, or somewhere else after that.
When I came to Harare, Zimbabwe in 1985, the government had placed social justice at the core of its national health policy.
After the long war of independence, a new government came into power, and the new government immediately established socialist policies. Health services and basic education were free.
As the number of local health centers has increased explosively, a remarkable achievement has been achieved with nearly 80% of the population being within two hours of a health center.
In 1980, shortly after independence, only 25% of children were vaccinated.
Ten years later, in 1990, the ratio increased to 80%.
I took great pride in being part of this change and revolution.
I felt a strong sense of excitement and camaraderie with people.
Working with great scientists, doctors, and activists in Zimbabwe, I felt I was in the field of the African independence movement and, by extension, the testing ground for the global welfare movement. But there were also difficult times.
In 1985, the year I first arrived,
First case of AIDS infection reported in Zimbabwe.
While receiving medical training, I took care of several AIDS patients, but it was difficult to expect equivalent medical resources in Africa.
Initially, the infection rate was around 2%. This figure was 17 years later when I left Harare.
It soared to one in four people.
In the mid-1990s, I diagnosed hundreds of people at the peak of their lives as AIDS-positive.
I have seen colleagues, friends, students, and patients in my care die.
In response, my colleagues and I opened a clinic.
We taught them how to use condoms.
Training was also provided at schools and workplaces.
I also did research. Companions of those infected provided counseling on how to protect themselves from the disease.
I worked hard and believed I was doing the best I could at the time.
As a doctor, I treated my patients well. But it did not argue that structural change was needed.
Former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan spoke honestly about his mistakes that led to the Rwandan genocide.
In 1994, he was Director of Peacekeeping Operations at the United Nations.
In a speech marking the 10th anniversary of the massacre, he recalled: “I believed I was doing the best I could at the time, but when I looked back after the massacre, I realized there was more I could have done, or should have done, and that I could have informed and helped.”
Now that AIDS has collapsed the health care system and killed an estimated 39 million people according to the World Health Organization, I also feel remorse and regret for what I did not do earlier.
Until I was in Zimbabwe, I did not see my role as policy advocacy or political participation.
I was there as an expert in medical and epidemiological technologies.
In my mind, my job was to slow the spread of disease by caring for patients and through research to better understand how the disease spreads.
I learned that marginalized groups in society were defenselessly exposed to the threat of AIDS.
Sugar plantations, which are more closed than any other modern business, found that 60% of pregnant women were infected with AIDS.
I tried to publicize the fact that AIDS infection is not caused by moral corruption but by male chauvinist culture, forced migrant labor, and colonization.
White people had lower rates of infection.
As health professionals, the tools we were given were very poor. The recommendations were to change lifestyle, use condoms, and reduce same-sex partners.
The infection rate continued to rise, and although the most promising treatment was developed in the West, it was unreasonable to distribute it to Africa due to cost. I am the cause of this great tragedy,
I have not been able to speak up about unequal access to treatment or problems with our economic and political systems. I justified my silence by thinking that I was just a guest in this country and that if I gave a warning too soon, I would be deported and would no longer be able to care for patients or do much-needed research.
So, I followed the government&#39;s initial response to AIDS.
I didn&#39;t voice my concerns loudly enough.
Many doctors and health experts will think it was not my fault.
The Hippocratic Oath, a contract with the patient, signifies the sacredness of the patient-doctor relationship.
And I gave each of my patients everything I could.
But I knew that disease arises from the cracks in our society. We found that social imbalance, alienation, and discrimination based on race, gender, and class, rather than just biology, had a greater impact.
AIDS was like that.
This was also the case with the recent Ebola outbreak.
Paul Farmer, a medical anthropologist who studied AIDS in Haiti, calls this &#39;violence by structure.&#39; The reason why structure is a problem is because in our society, there is inequality inherent in the political and economic structure that vested interests are unaware of. It is violence because the consequences are shocking: premature death, suffering, and disease.
Without awareness of this social injustice, patient treatment is only secondary.
Being warned about this in advance is the first step towards public health rights and a way to solve problems together and create real change. So today, I am not quiet.
Even if it is uncomfortable for the listeners,
I say many things, even when it makes me uncomfortable. Most things are racial polarization or
It&#39;s about normalized racism. These are things that should no longer be in this country. Especially in the areas of medicine and public health.
But they are brave and we don&#39;t really care.
This is a warning about the impact that racism will have on the health of the United States, and that the violence by organizations and individuals that people of color encounter every day leads to 250 years of slavery, 90 years of racial discrimination, and 60 years of incomplete equality in the sad history of the United States. That&#39;s why it&#39;s my job as New York&#39;s health commissioner to warn of this. In New York, the premature mortality rate, or the percentage of people who die before age 65, is
Black people are 50 percent more likely to die than white people.
In 2012, black women were more than 10 times more likely to die during childbirth than white women.
And despite the tremendous decline in infant mortality, black babies are still nearly three times more likely to die in their first year than white babies. New York is no exception.
These statistical results were similar to statistics obtained across the United States.
A recent New York Times analysis reported that 1.5 million black men are missing across the country. Next, you must be between the ages of 25 and 54.
With one in six black men incarcerated or dying prematurely, young black men are experiencing inequality and one-sided violence in their daily lives.
This can be seen clearly in the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, a recently emerging social movement. But at the same time, we understand their hardships and
It is important to remember that diseases such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS are slowly eating away at these people&#39;s lives and, in severe cases, lead to premature death as a result of the numerous risk factors and onset of major diseases.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I felt disappointed and angry that the medical community did not even use the word racism in research or the workplace.
I&#39;m sure my feelings will be conveyed to you as well.
Medical students often wear white coats and protest, but the medical community is largely silent about the impact of social discrimination on the spread of disease and mortality.
And I think about the personalized and precise medicine that develops treatments biologically or genetically, which modern medicine aims for, that the side effects of this movement are that the daily lives in which we live, grow, work, and love have the greatest impact on public health. that many people are disadvantaged
I&#39;m afraid I&#39;ll make you forget. As health professionals, in our daily lives, we are aware of enormous injustices every time we practice medicine or conduct research. A homeless person who cannot follow prescriptions because maintaining life is more urgent than his or her illness, a transgender young person considering suicide because he or she cannot endure discrimination in our society, or a person who takes responsibility for their child&#39;s illness alone.
There were also single mothers who felt this way. As health professionals, our role is not only to treat patients, but also to warn and encourage change.
Rightly or wrongly, our social status gives power to our words, and we must not waste this power.
As I regret what happened in Zimbabwe, I am committed as New York&#39;s health commissioner to give advance warning and spare no effort in supporting health equity. I am against racism,
We would like your help. Then, I will help you when you criticize sexism or other discrimination. Now we stand up
It is time to speak out together about structural inequality. How do I really change?
It’s okay not to consider every case. All we need is courage.
The health of our patients and all of us depends on it.
Raise your hand if you&#39;ve ever blocked someone on Facebook for saying something offensive about politics, religion, parenting, or food.
Or do you have at least one person you want to avoid?
In the old days, if you wanted to have a polite conversation, all you had to do was follow what Henry Higgins said in &quot;My Fair Lady.&quot; “Just talk about the weather and your health.”
But these days, with topics like climate change and anti-vaccine movements... those topics are also dangerous.
The world we live in is one where every conversation has the potential to turn into an argument, where politicians cannot even talk to each other, and where even the most trivial issues have someone passionately arguing for or against them. It&#39;s abnormal.
A Pew Institute study of 10,000 adult Americans found that we are now the most polarized and divided we have ever been.
There is less possibility of compromise. It means not listening to other people.
Where we live, who we marry, and even who we make friends are determined by what we already believe.
It means not listening to what other people say.
A conversation must have a balance between speaking and listening. But at some point we lost that balance.
To some extent, this is due to the advancement of technology.
We always have our smartphones with us or have them right next to us so we can pick them up at any time.
According to the Pew Institute, one in three American teens sends more than 100 texts every day.
And the majority of teenagers say they spend more time talking to their friends via text than face-to-face.
There was an interesting article in the monthly magazine The Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Barnwell.
Mr. Barnwell asked the students to
I gave them an assignment to speak on the spot without taking any notes.
And Mr. Barnwell said
“I realized that the art of conversation is the most underrated and untaught skill.”
Children spend hours every day interacting with screens, but they have few opportunities to develop their interpersonal communication skills.
This may be a strange question, but let&#39;s ask ourselves. Among the skills needed in the 21st century, is there any more important than being able to communicate logically and confidently?
My job is talking to people. Nobel laureate, billionaire truck driver, kindergarten teacher, head of state, plumber...
I talk to people I like and people I dislike.
Even though I talk to people I personally strongly disagree with.
Still, we have good conversations.
So I&#39;m going to spend the next 10 minutes teaching you how to talk and how to listen.
Many of you have probably already heard advice about this. For example, look them in the eye, think of an interesting topic in advance, nod your head and smile to show that you are listening, repeat or summarize what you just heard.
Forget all this advice.
That&#39;s bullshit.
If you really pay attention and listen, you don&#39;t need to learn how to let people know you&#39;re listening.
Even when I have everyday conversations
Use the techniques you would use for a professional interview. So, I will help you improve your conversation skills.
We&#39;ll teach you interview techniques. Not a waste of time, not boring, not offending others
Learn how to have a conversation.
We&#39;ve all had good conversations. I know what good conversation looks like because I&#39;ve done it before. Engaging and inspiring
A conversation where you feel like you really got through or are completely understood.
In most conversations you have, there&#39;s no way to avoid that. I&#39;ll tell you 10 basic rules. I will tell you all in detail, but if you master just one of these,
You can enjoy much better conversations.
First, don&#39;t do multiple things at once. Cell phone, tablet, car keys or whatever you have in your hand.
I&#39;m not saying you should just put it down.
Live in the moment.
Stay focused.
The argument I had with my boss earlier, what’s on tonight’s menu.
Don&#39;t think about that. If you want to end a conversation you&#39;re having, don&#39;t focus vaguely and just drop out of the conversation.
Second, don&#39;t preach.
If you only want to express your opinion and don&#39;t want reactions, arguments, rebuttals, or growth, just write on a blog.
The reason I don&#39;t have current affairs commentators on my show is because they&#39;re boring people.
If you&#39;re conservative, you&#39;ll hate Obama, welfare, and abortion.
If you&#39;re a progressive, you probably hate big banks, oil companies, and Dick Cheney.
It&#39;s completely obvious.
You shouldn&#39;t do this.
Always approach the conversation with the attitude that you have something to learn.
Famous psychotherapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening means letting go of yourself.
This means that there are times when you have to set aside your personal opinions.
According to him, when the speaker feels that the listener is accepting, he or she becomes more vulnerable and more open.
Again, think that there is always something to learn.
Bill Nighy: “Everyone you meet knows something you don’t know.”
To put it in my own words, everyone is an expert in some field.
Third, ask questions that can be answered freely.
Learn from the way reporters write this.
Start your questions with the rule of thumb.
When you ask complex questions, you get simple answers.
When I ask, “Were you afraid?”
You would answer “yes” or “no” in response to the most powerful word in the question: fear.
“Are you angry?” “Yes, I was very angry.”
Let the person answering describe it themselves. You know your own feelings.
Ask questions like “How was it?” or “How did it feel?”
ask.
Then the person answering will have to think for a moment and come up with a more interesting answer.
Fourth, follow the flow of the conversation.
This means that when a thought comes into your head, you have to get it out of your head.
In some interviews, after the guest has been talking for several minutes, the host suddenly asks another question that is out of the blue or has already been answered.
This means that a very sharp question occurred to the host, so he stopped listening for two minutes and waited for the right moment to ask that question.
We do the same thing.
While sitting and talking with someone, I suddenly remember meeting Hugh Jackman at a coffee shop before.
Then we stop listening.
Some topic or idea will come to mind.
Still, I have to let it go.
Fifth, if you don’t know, say you don’t know.
Nowadays, people on radio, especially public broadcasting, are careful to say, &#39;I know for sure because I am an expert in this field&#39; because they know that what they say will be recorded.
You too, be overly cautious.
Conversation should not be frivolous.
Sixth, don&#39;t equate your experience with someone else&#39;s.
When someone talks about a death in the family, don&#39;t talk about the time you lost a family member.
If someone says work at work is difficult, don&#39;t complain about your work.
It&#39;s never the same.
Every experience is different.
First of all, you are not the center.
There is no need to use that moment to brag or complain.
When someone asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was, he said, &quot;I don&#39;t know. People who brag about their IQ are idiots.&quot;
A conversation is not an opportunity to brag about yourself.
Seventh, don&#39;t repeat what you said. It seems pretentious and really boring. But we do that often.
Especially at work or when talking to your children, if you have a point you want to make, you end up repeating the same thing.
Don&#39;t do that.
Eighth, don&#39;t obsess about details.
Honestly, the listener doesn&#39;t care about details like the exact year, name, or date you&#39;re trying to remember. We are interested in you.
I care about who you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details. You don&#39;t have to say it.
Ninth, not last, but the most important.
Please listen.
Many great people have said time and time again that listening is probably the most important skill you can develop. The Buddha said, “If your mouth is open, you are not learning.”
President Calvin Coolidge said, &quot;No one ever got fired for listening too much.&quot;
Why don&#39;t we listen?
First, because we want to talk.
When I speak, I control the conversation.
You don’t have to listen to things I’m not interested in.
I get attention
It can strengthen my identity.
But there are other reasons too. We get distracted.
People speak an average of 225 words per minute, but we can hear up to 500 words per minute.
So, I&#39;m filling in the remaining 275 words in my head.
i know. It takes a lot of effort and energy to focus on other people. But if you&#39;re not focused, you&#39;re not talking
It&#39;s just two people throwing unrelated sentences in the same space and time.
We must listen to each other.
Stephen Kirby said,
“We listen not to understand, but to respond.”
Lastly, tenth, speak briefly.
&#39;Good conversation is a miniskirt. Short enough to maintain interest and long enough to cover the topic.&#39; -My brother In the end, the basic principle of all of this is one thing. Be interested in others.
I grew up with a famous grandfather, so there was a kind of ritual in the family.
When someone came to talk to my grandparents, my mom would ask me if I knew who that person was.
“That person is Miss America.
That&#39;s the mayor of Sacramento.
That person is a Pulitzer Prize winner. “That person is a Russian ballerina.”
So I grew up thinking that everyone had a hidden wonder.
I think I became a good host thanks to that thought.
Keep your mouth as quiet as possible, keep your mind open, always be prepared to be surprised, and never be disappointed.
You too, do the same.
Get out there, talk to people, listen, and most of all, prepare to be surprised.
thank you
hello.
My name is Matthew Williams. And I am a champion.
I was proud to win multiple medals in three of my sports at Canadian national competitions, compete at an international level in basketball, and represent Canada on a global stage.
I train for basketball and speed skating five days a week. I work with the best coaches and psychiatrists to help me become the best in my field.
All of this is made possible through Special Olympics.
Has this changed your opinion of me and my achievements?
The world doesn&#39;t see all people like me as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were avoided and had to be hidden.
There have been many changes since the Special Olympics began in 1968, but for the most part, people with intellectual disabilities are invisible to many people.
People use the &#39;ㅂ&#39; word in front of me and think it doesn&#39;t matter.
The word is used in a way that insults and degrades people, such as &#39;asshole&#39; or &#39;looks like an asshole&#39;.
They don&#39;t think about how much these words hurt me and my friends.
I hope you don&#39;t think I&#39;m here for charity.
The reason I&#39;m here is because many people still have a huge problem with the way they view people with intellectual disabilities, or in too many cases, don&#39;t even recognize them.
Did you know that there was a world competition this year?
I was one of over 6,500 intellectually disabled athletes from 165 countries who gathered in Los Angeles to participate in the Special Olympics.
More than 62,000 spectators watched the opening ceremony, which was broadcast live on TSN and ESPN channels.
Did you know this happened?
What do you think when you see a person like me?
Here today, I hope you and I look at each other as equals.
Special Olympics changes the self-identity of athletes with intellectual disabilities
It also changes the perspective of everyone watching. For those of you who don&#39;t know,
Special Olympics is a competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
This is separate from the Paralympic Games or the Olympic Games. We are committed to changing the quality of life and perspectives for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
This movement changed not only my life, but also the lives of many others. And all over the world, people with intellectual disabilities
The way we look at it has also changed.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
As a child, I played hockey until I was 12. The older I got, the more difficult it was to keep up with other children, which made me frustrated and angry.
I haven&#39;t done any exercise in a while. I didn&#39;t have many friends, and I felt lonely and sad.
There was a time when people with intellectual disabilities were hidden from society.
No one knew they would play sports or become valuable members of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the effects of general exercise on the health of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through rigorous scientific research, Dr. Hayden and other researchers concluded that the health of children with intellectual disabilities was reduced because they lacked opportunities to participate in sports.
Many people doubted whether health programs or sports competitions would be of much benefit to people with intellectual disabilities.
But Dr. Hayden and Special Olympics founder Eunice Kennedy Schriefer were undeterred pioneers, and Special Olympics athletes went on to prove them right 4.5 million times over.
Before joining Special Olympics, I was very anxious. Because I was young, timid, lacked confidence, and didn&#39;t have many friends.
But the moment I stood on that stage, everyone encouraged me, supported me, and helped me be myself regardless of what others thought.
I am now a basketball player and speed skater. He participated in several local and national competitions, and even participated in the Summer Olympics held in LA this year, and was a member of the first basketball team in Canadian history to participate in a world competition.
I&#39;m one of over 4.5 million athletes in the world, but I&#39;ve heard many similar stories.
Becoming a Special Olympics athlete restores our self-esteem and self-esteem.
Special Olympics also addresses important health needs.
Many studies have shown that, on average, men with intellectual disabilities die 13 years earlier than men without disabilities, and women with intellectual disabilities die 20 years earlier than women without disabilities.
Special Olympics keeps us healthy by keeping us moving and participating in sports.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
Furthermore, Special Olympics provides free health screenings to athletes who have difficulty communicating with doctors or who have difficulty obtaining health insurance.
At the 2015 Summer Olympics, my Canadian teammates and I played against the Nigerian national basketball team.
The day before the match, the Nigerian team attended the World Games athlete health check-up, and seven out of ten athletes received free hearing aids, allowing them to hear for the first time in their lives.
The change that came to them was enormous.
They were more excited, happy, and confident. This is because I was able to communicate verbally with the director.
I was moved again. Because we heard the sound of a basketball, a whistle, and the cheering of the audience -- because of these sounds that are so natural to us.
Special Olympics doesn&#39;t just change athletes within one sport.
It’s even changing their lives outside the stadium.
Several studies this year have shown that half of the adult population in the United States do not know a single person with an intellectual disability, and 44% of Americans who have no personal connection to intellectual disability say they regard it with much less respect.
There is also a &#39;ㅂ&#39; word there. This means that people with intellectual disabilities are still invisible to many people.
People use this word both casually and as an insult.
Last year, this word was mentioned on Twitter more than 9 million times, and for me and my 4.5 million fellow athletes around the world, this is incredibly hurtful.
Many people think this isn&#39;t offensive, but it&#39;s not.
My colleague and Global Messenger John Franklin Stevens publicly responded to a political pundit who used the &#39;ㅂ&#39; word as an insult. “Will you join us at the Special Olympics sometime?
Let&#39;s see if you can walk away without your heart changing. &quot;
This year, at the 2015 Summer Olympics, people lined up for hours to watch the weightlifting finals.
In the end, it was standing room only, and my proud colleague Jackie Barrett deadlifted 297kg and squatted 277kg. It was the best record in Special Olympics history.
Jackie holds the highest record among all weightlifters in Newfoundland. Not just in the Special Olympics, but all weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN couldn&#39;t help but admire his performance, updating his stats in real time on Twitter.
Fifty years ago, not many people would have thought that people with intellectual disabilities would achieve such a thing.
This year, 60,000 spectators filled the LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games and cheer on numerous athletes from 165 countries from all over the world.
Far from being hidden away, we were supported and celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and proud.
Special Olympics teaches the world that people with intellectual disabilities are worthy members of our society.
I now have dreams and achievements in my sport, have great coaches, respect and self-esteem, and am much healthier. Now I am trying to become a personal trainer.
I&#39;m no longer hiding or being made fun of, I&#39;m here to give a TED talk.
The world has changed a lot thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet someone with intellectual disabilities, take a look at their talents.
Next time someone around you uses the &#39;ㅂ&#39; word, I want you to know how hurtful that trivial comment can be.
We also hope that you will participate in the Special Olympics.
Let me say one last thing.
Nelson Mandela said, “Sport has the power to change the world.” He said.
Special Olympics is changing the world. By transforming 4.5 million athletes, we&#39;re empowering them to stand up, meet friends, feel like a champion, and become a champion without being judged.
thank you
You may not have heard of Kenema or Arua.
But I know those two places as the strangest places on Earth.
Its hospitals are home to a community of nurses, doctors, and scientists who have been quietly confronting humanity&#39;s deadliest threat for years. Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
It can cause severe fever and can be very fatal.
And yet they risk their lives every day to protect those here, and all of us.
But the strangest thing I learned about them when I first visited them a few years ago was that they began each day on the hard front lines with a song.
They come together and share joy
It shows their fighting spirit.
And over the years, when I visit them and when they visit me, we get together and have fun singing and writing. Because it tells us that we are not just here to pursue science, but that we are united by our shared humanity.
As you can imagine, that process has become very important and essential even when something is changing.
And when an Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea in March 2014, it changed many things.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa. The location of the outbreak was near the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And it was very scary, we were all scared.
We actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than we thought and would one day reach Kenema.
So members of my research team were immediately dispatched to join Dr. Humar Khan and his team to prepare precise molecular diagnostics to be able to detect immediately if Ebola crossed the border into Sierra Leone.
We already had experience building such a system for the Lassa virus, so we knew how to respond this time. This team is very good.
All we had to do was give them the tools and a place to investigate Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day has come.
On May 23, 2014, a woman was admitted to the hospital&#39;s obstetrics and gynecology department, and team members performed critical molecular diagnostics to confirm Sierra Leone&#39;s first case of Ebola.
This was truly outstanding.
By immediately diagnosing this case, they were able to safely treat the patient and begin contact tracing to determine what happened.
Maybe it could have stopped something.
But by the time that day arrived, Ebola had already been breeding for months.
With hundreds of cases, it has already surpassed past diseases.
And it came to Sierra Leone not as a single case, but as a tidal wave.
We worked with the international community, the Ministry of Health and Kinema to deal with a number of cases, one week 31 cases, then 92, then 147 cases, all coming to Kenema, the only place in Sierra Leone that could handle it.
And while we worked around the clock doing everything we could, trying to help people, trying to get noticed, we accomplished one more simple thing.
In samples taken from patients&#39; blood to detect Ebola. Of course, you can discard the specimen.
All we could do was put chemicals in it to deactivate it, put it in a box and ship it across the ocean, and that&#39;s what we did.
I sent it to Boston, where my team works.
We worked tirelessly, day after day, and created 99 Ebola virus genomes.
This was the blueprint. A viral genomic blueprint.
We all have it.
It talks about everything that makes us who we are and gives us a lot of information.
The results of these experiments are very simple and impactful.
We were able to take these 99 different viruses and look at them and compare them. And I could tell. In fact, by comparing the genomes of three previous outbreaks in Guinea. We can show that it emerged in Guinea a few months ago and has entered the human population, spreading from person to person.
This is very important. To know how to intervene, but more important than that was contact tracing.
We could see that the virus was mutating as it spread from person to person.
And each mutation was very important, because the diagnostics, the vaccines, the treatments we were using were all based on the genetic sequence that fundamentally drives the virus.
So global health experts had to react to this, develop, and recalibrate everything they were doing.
But the way science worked from where I was at that point was you would gather data, work in isolation for months, analyze the data very carefully and slowly, propose a paper to publish, research around it, and finally, when the paper was published, the data was It would have been distributed.
This is how the current situation works.
But it won&#39;t work at this point, right? Yes?
We had friends on the front lines and what we clearly needed was help, lots of help.
So the first thing we did was, as soon as the genome sequences were machine-checked, we published them on the web.
I put it out there for the whole world to say, &quot;Please help me.&quot;
And then help came.
Before we knew it, people from all over the world were contacting us, amazed to see the data released.
Some really great virus trackers have been with our community at some point.
We worked together virtually. Through sharing, regular phone calls, communication, etc. I followed the virus moment by moment and tried to find various ways to stop it.
There are many ways to create these communities.
Especially as the disease outbreak spread globally, everyone reached out to learn about the disease, participate, and get involved.
Everyone wanted to play a role.
The amount of human capacity displayed here is quite astounding. And the Internet has connected us all.
You want us to say, instead of being afraid of each other, “Let’s do this.”
Can you imagine saying, “Let’s work together to make it happen?”
But the problem was with the materials we were all using. Googling on the web had limitations in accomplishing what we needed to do.
And when that happens, you miss out on countless opportunities.
At the beginning of Kinema&#39;s pandemic, we had 106 patient clinical records, which we again released to the world.
And in our lab, we were able to give you access to 106 records and train computers to predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with 100 percent accuracy.
We also created an app to distribute it so that medical staff in the field could use it.
But the number 106 wasn&#39;t enough to make it powerful and recognized.
So we are waiting for more materials to be distributed.
Those data are still not coming.
We are still waiting and improving in the isolation room. Instead of working together.
And we cannot accept this fact.
Isn&#39;t it? Neither of you will be able to accept it.
Because our lives are at stake.
And the truth is, many lives were lost. Many medical staff, including colleagues I love, five colleagues: Embalu Foni, Alex Moigboi, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Koboma and Mohammed Fulla.
These are five of the many health workers who died in Kenema and elsewhere, quietly, in isolation, while the world was waiting and we were all working.
You know, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is exacerbated by distrust, dispersion, and division.
When we build walls and fight against each other, viruses thrive.
But unlike all the threats to humanity, Ebola is a place where we are all human.
We are all in this fight together.
Ebola disease in one family can become ours at any moment.
So here, with the same vulnerability, the same strength, the same fear, the same hope, I hope we can work together with joy.
One of my graduate students was reading a book about Sierra Leone and the word &quot;Kenema,&quot; the hospital where we worked and the city we worked in in Sierra Leone, comes from a Mende word meaning &quot;clean and transparent, like a river, open to the public eye.&quot; I found that it did.
It surprised us all. Because even before we knew it, we always felt it. To honor the people of Kenema where we worked, we had to work openly, share, and work together.
And it has to be that way.
We all must be demanding of ourselves and others. When a disease occurs, we must open our hearts to each other and say let&#39;s fight together.
Because this is not the first outbreak of Ebola. And it&#39;s not the last either. Tons of microorganisms are waiting outside. There are many more than Lassa virus.
And the next time something like this happens, it could happen in a city with tens of thousands of people.
It could be a disease that is transmitted through the air.
It could be spread intentionally.
I know it&#39;s scary, but I also know this, and this experience shows us that we have the skills and abilities to overcome this. By winning, we gain the upper hand over the viruses.
But we can only achieve it if we do it together, and we have to do it with joy.
So for Dr. Khan, and for the countless others who have always sacrificed their lives on the front lines of this fight with us, let us always be with them in this fight.
Let us not be defined by the world ravaged by the virus, but let us shine, united, by the hearts and minds of billions of people.
thank you
