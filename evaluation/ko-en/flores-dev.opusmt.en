Stars emit light and heat because of the energy that hydrogen atoms are made when combined to form heavier elements.
Scientists are trying to make nuclear reactors that can make energy in the same way.
But it's going to take a long time to see a fusion reactor that's a very difficult problem to solve.
The iron needle floats in the water due to surface tension.
The surface tension is caused by water molecules on the surface of the water pulling each other more strongly than air molecules on top.
The water molecule creates an invisible membrane on the surface of the water that causes a needle-like object to come up on top of the water.
The modern ice skate blade has a two-sided hole between it and the two edges that allow it to hold the ice better even when it's tilted.
The floor of the day is slightly bent, so that when the day inclines toward one side or the other, the edge of the ice is also bent.
This allows the skater to rotate. When the skate tilts to the right, the skater turns to the right, and if the skater turns to the left, the skater turns to the left.
To get back to the previous energy level, you must remove extra energy from the light.
"This is possible through the release of a little light particle called "the photon."
"Scientists call this process "synthetic stimulation" because the atom is stimulated by light and emits a photon of light, and light is a type of radiation."
The next picture shows an atom that emits photons, which, of course, is actually much smaller than the picture.
The photon is smaller than the material that makes up the atom!
After hundreds of hours of using the light bulb, the cement burns and the light bulb no longer turns on.
Then you have to replace the lightbulbs. You have to pay attention when you replace the light bulbs.
Turn off the light switch or separate the cable.
This is because if the metal base of the socket or light bulb is still touching while it's still part of the socket, it can be strongly electrocuted by electricity flowing through the light bulb's socket.
The main organ of the circulatory system is the heart, which serves as a blood supply.
The blood comes out of the heart through a tube called an artery, and it comes back into the heart through a tube called a vein, and the smallest tubes are called capillaries.
Triceratops ’ teeth would have been able to crush not only leaves but also very strong branches and roots.
Some scientists believe that Triceratops ate soy plants, which were common to a hundred musical instruments.
This plant is like a small palm tree with sharp, pointed leaves in a crown shape.
Triceratops could use strong beaks to remove the leaves before eating the tree trunk.
Other scientists claim that the toxic nature of these plants makes any dinosaur less likely to eat these plants, even though other animals, such as sloths and parrots, can eat poisonous leaves or fruit.
If you're standing on the surface of io, it's going to weigh less than on Earth.
If you're 200 pounds off the planet, you're going to have 36 pounds in Iowa, which is why gravity is less likely to pull you.
The sun is a planet made of gas, fire and plasma.
The farther away from the center of the sun, the thinning of the gas layer.
"When we look at the sun, the observable outer part is called a photon, meaning "a ball of fire."
In 1610, about three thousand years later, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei used a telescope to observe that there are phases like the moon of Venus.
Venus's phase change is only when Venus, or the side of the moon, gets light from the sun.

There's a lot of theories about how Sanskrit came about, and one of them is that the Aryans brought their language from the west to India.
The Sanskrit language is an ancient language and is similar to the Latin spoken in Europe.
The first known book in the world was written in the Sanskrit language, and after the editing of the Upanishads, the Sanskrit language declined because of the class.
The Sanskrit language, a very complex and rich language, is the origin of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the origin of European languages, such as French and Spanish.
To take over France, Germany began to prepare itself to invade the British Isles.
Germany has named the attack "Operation Society" because most of the British' heavy weapons and supplies have been lost when they withdrew from Hungkerk.
But the Royal Navy was still much stronger than the German Navy and was able to bring down any invading fleet that came through the English Channel.
But the British Navy ship has hardly set a base near the invasion path in fear of sinking under German air raids.
To explain the plan in Italy first, it was the brother of Germany and Japan.
Italy built four new warships just before the beginning of the war, but both the Army and the Navy were weaker.
Italy's main target was the African countries, which needed a military launch to invade Africa across the Mediterranean.
In addition to this action, the Italian warships had to do nothing else.
Now, if you look at Japan, Japan was an island country like the United Kingdom.
The submarine is a ship designed to move under the water, and it can stay submerged for quite a while.
Submarines were used in World War I and World War II; they were very slow at the time, and their range was very limited.
In the early war, they usually sailed over the sea, but as radar was developed and more accurate, the submarine had to sink into the sea without being seen.
German submarines were called U-Boat. The Germans were very good at sailing and running them.
Germany, because of the success of the submarine, has not been trusted to have more since the war.
King Tutankhamen, called King Tutt or The Boy King, is one of the most well-known ancient Egyptian kings in modern times.

Perhaps the most widely known of them is the legendary blind poet Homer, who wrote two masterpieces of Greek literature: Iliad and Odisei.
Sophocles and Aristophanes are still famous dramatists, and their plays are considered one of the greatest works of world literature.
Another famous Greek is Mathematician Pythagoras, and the most famous theorem is primarily about the length of the three sides of a right triangle.
There is a variety of scandals about how many people speak Hindi, which is thought to be the world's most widely used language between the second and the fourth.
The number of people in the original languages can change depending on whether or not they include a very closely related dialect.
It's estimated to be 340 million to 500 million, and up to 800 million people can understand this language.
The Hindi and Urdu characters are different, but because they have a similar vocabulary, the people who speak the two languages can understand each other in everyday conversation.
By the 15th century, northern Estonia was strongly influenced by the culture of Germany.
Some German monks invented Estonian language to make the natives feel closer to God.

Learning how to create interactive media requires not only traditional technology but also sophisticated tools in interactive classes (such as storyboarding, audio and video editing, and storytelling).
In interactive design, you have to re-evaluate your assumptions about media production, and you have to learn to think in a series of ways.
Interactive design has to have a component of the project connected to each other, but it also has to be understood as a separate object.
The disadvantage of zoom lens is that the focus complexity and the number of lens elements needed to match the various focal length are much larger than that of a monologue.
As lens manufacturers achieve higher lens production standards, it's a secondary problem.
This allows the zoom lens to create a picture of a quality similar to the quality achieved by a fixed focal length lens.
The other disadvantage of zoom lens is that the maximum value of the recipe is usually lower.
This makes low-cost zoom lenses difficult to use under low-acquired conditions without a flash.
Orbuscan is one of the most common problems that arise when you try to convert movies into DVD formats.
Most TVs are made in a way to entertain the public.
That's why what you see on TV cuts the edges of the top, the bottom, and the side.
It's made to fill the entire screen. It's called an object can.
Unfortunately, when you make a DVD, you cut the edges, and the subtitles that are close to the bottom of the screen are probably cut off.
The traditional medieval castles inspired the imagination, and reminded us of the images of the magic window contests, banquets and knights of King Arthur.
Even if you're standing in the ruins thousands of years later, it's as if you've been reminded of the sound and smell of long forgotten battles, and you've heard the sound of horses' hoofs running wildly over the gravel, and in the pit it's as if you've got a sense of fear.
But is our imagination based on reality? Why was the castle built in the first place? How were they designed and built?
In this period of history, the castle of Kirby Mousslo is more like a fortified house than a true castle.
The big windows and thin walls of this would not have long prevented a determined attack.
In 1940, when Sir Hastings began to build, the country was tranquil, and it needed only to stop a small, bustling predator.
The balance of power was the system that all European countries sought to maintain their national sovereignty.
Europeans had to prevent one of them from becoming powerful, and governments often changed their alliances in order to keep their balance.
The Spanish succession war was the first war that broke the balance of power.
This meant that the European powers would no longer have the name of a religious war, so the Thirty Years' War would be the last war classified as a religious war.
The temple of Artemis in Ephesus was destroyed on July 21, 356 B.C., by Herodotus.
According to the story, he was motivated by honor at any cost, and the angry Ephesians declared that the name of Herodotus should never be recorded.

The Indus civilization is a bronze civilization in northwest India, developed in most of modern Pakistan and in parts of northwest India and northeastern Afghanistan.
This civilization thrived along the Indus River basin, so this is what it's called.
Some scholars assume that because there was a civilization in the now dry Saarswati river, he should appropriately be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, but some scholars call it Harappa, the site of the first civilization to be unearthed in the 1920s, Harappa civilization.
The militaristic aspect of the Roman Empire helped advance medicine.
The practice was started by Emperor Augustus and formed the first Roman forces to prepare for the demand for the aftermath of battle.
Surgeons had a knowledge of various tranquilizers, such as morphine from poppy seeds, saripool from Skopulamine.
They became skilled not only in compression pads and arteries to block blood flow, but also in cuttings to save patients from necrosis.
Over the centuries, the Roman Empire has had great success in medicine and has formed many parts of the knowledge that we know today.
Fuerland origami is a way of folding that limits that it should be folded only once, that it should not be allowed to fold more complicatedly, and that all folds should be simply positioned.

"It's not a learning disability, it's more than learning, it affects 3 to 5% of all children, and perhaps 2 million American children."
Children with ADD have a hard time focusing on things like school assignments, but they can concentrate on things that are fun, like playing games, watching favorite cartoons, or writing sentences without a word.
"These kids tend to be in a lot of trouble, because they want something even more stimulating, and they want to do something dangerous, to fight, to challenge authority."
ADD affects relationships with other peers because other kids don't understand why kids with ADHD behave that way, why they say that, or why they're mature.
As the ability to acquire and learn knowledge has changed in the way mentioned above, the standard of learning has changed.
The approach to information was different, and now it's starting to focus more on the ability to summon, not the ability of individuals to summon.
In essence, the Renaissance has brought about significant changes in the access to learning and in the distribution of knowledge.
Unlike other primates, the ancestors of mankind no longer use their hands to walk, to support weight, or to ride trees.
Chimps ’ hands, feet, reflect the use of their hands to hold their weight and are about the same size as their feet.
Human hands are shorter than feet, including bones.
The fossils of two to three million years ago show that the hand's specialization process has been altered by manipulation from motion.
Some people think it can be very tiring to have a lot, often, of artificially induced consciousness.
The main reason for this phenomenon is that the period between REM states has been extended during the event.

Perhaps the most common type that most people associate with travel is resort tourism.
This is when people leave their normal lives and go to a very different place to enjoy themselves.
Beaches, theme parks, and camping grounds are often the most common places for vacation tourists.
If the purpose of visiting a particular place is to know about history and culture, this type of tourism is called cultural tourism.
Tourists can visit various places in a particular country, or simply choose to focus on just one area.
The colonists also saw this activity and asked for reinforcements.
The reinforcements in front of the camp included 200 members of the First and Third New Hampshire regiment, who were Colonel John Stark and Captain James Reed (later both become generals).
Stark's men took their position along the northernmost fence in the position of the Colonist.
As the tide turned out, the crevices along the Mystic River, which runs through the northeastern part of the peninsula, they quickly extended the fence to a short stone wall to the north to the edge of a small beach.
Greeley and Stark set up a base about 100 feet in front of the fence and ordered no one to fire until the regular army passed.
The U.S. mission was a joint attack in three directions.
General John Cadwalder will hit British garrisons in Bodentown to stop the reinforcements.
General James Yuing led 700 militias across the river from Trenton Ferry to take over the bridge in the Asunping Peaks and block the enemy's escape.

It's a relatively inexpensive exercise, but there's a lot of misunderstandings about some of the equipment you need to participate in.
Products can be purchased for demand, but most of the time, they have little effect on performance.
The athletes can feel that they prefer the product even if it doesn't actually provide benefits.
An atom can be thought of as one of the core components of all matter.
It's a very complex object, and according to a simplified Boer model, it's made up of electrons rotating around the nucleus, just like planets moving along the sun.
The nucleus is made up of two particles called neutrons and protons.
The proton has a positive charge, while the neutron has no charge, the electron has a negative charge.

The study revealed that depression, fear, and dislocation affect the relationship between pain and disability in lower back back pain patients.
It's not depression and fear, it's catastrophe, but it's a regular, structured, PA session every week.
For those who participated in regular activities, more support was needed on the high level of pain and discomfort associated with physical activity and the negative perception of suffering.
The vision, or the ability to see, is the sensory organ of the visual system, the eye.
Depending on the requirements of organisms, there are many, many different structures of the eye.
Different structures have different functions, are sensitive to different wavelength lengths, and are different in accuracy.
The population is a set of organisms within a specific geographic area.
When all the members of the group have the same characteristics in relation to certain etymological characteristics, they're known as monochromatics.
When an individual shows a number of variations of a particular personality, it's an object that's formed all of them.
Military ant colonies march at different times and build an ant nest.
At this stage of migration, the army ants march at night and stop during the day to camp.
They start nomadic life when there's less food, and they make other temporary nests every day during this period.
Each of these oil mines or processions last almost 17 days.
The word "cell" comes from the Latin "cella" meaning "little room" and is first made by a microscope user observing the structure of cork.
The cell is the basic unit of all living things, and every organism is made up of more than one cell.
"The fact is that cells are so fundamental and decisive in the study of life that they are often referred to as "the building blocks of life."
The nervous system sends nerve signals throughout the body to keep the blood flow intact.

Greed and selfishness will always be with us, and the nature of cooperation will always allow us to take more in a short time by selfish actions, in situations where many benefit from it.
Hopefully, most people will realize that working with other people is the best option in the long run.
Many people dream of a day when humans can travel to other stars and explore other worlds, some people wonder what's out there, some people believe that aliens and other creatures can live on other stars.
But even if it does happen, it won't happen for a long time, because stars are so far away that even neighbors have thousands of trillion miles apart.
Maybe one day your great-grandchildren will stand on top of the alien world and wonder about their ancient ancestors.
Animals are made up of lots of cells, they eat food, they digest it in their bodies, and most of them can move.
Only animals have brains.
Animals live all over the world, they dig, they swim in the ocean, they fly in the sky.
Cells are the smallest unit of structure and function of organisms.

Sometimes what causes avalanches is that the sun warms the eyes, or more snows, or other natural factors that happen, and often people.
The tornado is a column where the air at low pressure rotates and drags the surrounding air inwards and sends it up.
A very strong wind (mostly 100 to 200 miles per hour) can cause heavy objects to be lifted into the air as they rotate.
It starts with a funnel coming down from a dark cloud, and when it hits the ground, it becomes "tonedo."

It usually provides a higher Internet connection speed and a better quality service, which also makes it encrypted and difficult to monitor.
"In order to prevent copying", the media company cheats on its real purpose.
In fact, local code has no effect on illegal copying, since disk copy, which is no different from the original, will work on any device as well as the original.
The real goal is to give companies more control over the market, and all of this is to make a profit.
The phone is sent online, so you don't have to use a communication company in your home or in your traveling area.
You don't need to get local numbers in the community you live in, you can get satellite Internet access from an undiscovered Alaskan chicken, and you can choose those numbers that claim to be in sunny Arizona.
In order to get a phone call from the telephone, you have to buy an international number separately, and the difference between where the numbers come from and whether or not you can get a call from the sender.
A real-time text translator app - an application to automatically translate text from one language to another.
Some of the applications in this field translate foreign languages, including signs, when users point their smartphones toward the subject.
The translation engine has improved dramatically, and now it's doing a rather accurate translation (and there's very little to do) but we still have to pay some attention to the fact that we can mistranslate the entire sentence.
One of the most prominent apps in this category is Google Translation, which allows you to download your language data and then implement it in an offline state.
Using GPS navigation apps on smartphones will be the easiest and most convenient way to find your way abroad.

If you're not a diplomat, working abroad means that you have to report income tax in countries that you normally live in.
Income taxes are made up of different countries, and tax rates and tax ratings vary greatly from country to country.
In some federal countries, such as the United States and Canada, income taxes can be added both to federal and local taxes, so the rate and the gap can vary from place to place.

like the Great Sea and the Great Lakes and the Lakes, and St. Petersburg, which usually link rivers and lakes to the North Pole and the Baltic Sea.
Since you're connected to the lake, it's still possible to come through Russia from the Caspian Sea.
Don't worry that once you get to the ocean, everything's going to be clear, you're going to meet other boat Hitchhikers, and you're going to share their information with them.
Basically you will draw attention to trying to get to the sailor at the bar, to help you, to stand by the docks, to clean the yachts.
Talk to as many people as you can, and in a while everyone will get to know you, and they'll tell you which boat to get people from.
You have to carefully choose the mileage service airline from the Union.
You might think it's the most intuitive choice to join an airline that you use most often, but I want you to know that the benefits of each airline are often different, and that other airlines on the same jet airlines offer more and more customer points.
Emirates, Etihard, Qatar, Turkey, and many other airlines have expanded their service to Africa, and they also provide an air connection to the major cities of Africa at a low price compared to other European airlines.
Turkish air travel to 39 destinations in 30 African countries by 2014.

French in France and French in Belgium and Switzerland are similar enough to communicate, but there are some differences.
In Belgium and Switzerland, especially where French is spoken, there is a little bit of a difference between French and French, and some words have a slightly different pronunciation.
Nevertheless, both the Belgians and the Swiss who speak French will have learned standard French at school, so even if they use the standard French code system, they can understand it.
"In most parts of the world, waving is a kind gesture that says "hello."
"But, at least among the Malays in rural areas, it means "Come on in," which is similar to a gesture used in a certain Western country, the index finger, which has to be used only for that purpose."
In the same way, a person who greets his palm with good-byes (which means he sees the back of his hand) who is traveling through Spain may be mistaken for saying, "Come back."
The secondary language is an artificial language, or an artificial language, designed to make communication possible for people who have difficulty communicating.

Bird flu, more officially known as bird influenza, can infect both birds and mammals.
There have been fewer than a thousand cases reported in humans, but some of them have been fatal.
