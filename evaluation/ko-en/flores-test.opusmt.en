It not only confirms, at least, that some dinosaurs, the most widely known theory, had feathers, but also provides details that are generally lacking only in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional configurations.
Scientists have revealed that the top of the dinosaur feather was dark brown and the bottom was white or yellow.
Such discoveries also provide insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Dinosaurs don't have well-developed feathers called shafts, but they have other characteristic feathers, such as taste buds and small barbs, and researchers assumed that these different characteristics would later evolve and develop to the right.

According to FAAA, NextGen is a system in which aircraft can fly a shorter track, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions every year.
It uses satellite-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to specificise aircraft with very high accuracy and provide pilots with more accurate information than they used ground radar-based technology before.
They're not going to provide extra transportation or stop land trains, and they're not going to be able to use parking lots and public transportation parking lots on the ground.
Concern over the public traffic shortage has increased the likelihood that the game will be played uncommunicatively without supporters.
A study published last Thursday in Science magazine announced the formation of new species of birds on the Galápagos Islands in Ecuador.
Although researchers at Princeton University in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported new species evolved in just two generations, it is believed that this process took much longer to reproduce between the local bird, Darwin finches, mid-ground finches and cacti finches, and large cactus finches.
Gold can be processed in all kinds of shapes, even in very small shapes.
It can be cut with thin lines, bent or twisted, it can be hammered or styled.
"Gold can be made very thin and can be attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it's used to decorate the hands of a book called "The Color Manuscript."
It's called the pH of a chemical substance, and you can use red cabbage juice to make a label.
The cabbage juice changes depending on how acid or base the chemical is.
The pH level represents the amount of hydrogen ions in a rough chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that an electron has been stripped off.
They stir the two dry powders together, and then they squeeze them into the ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hand reacts to the outer layer, gives you an interesting touch, and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo Daro had in almost every home a flush toilet connected to an elaborate sewer system.
In the houses of the Greek city of Santorini and Creta Minoa, a sewer system was discovered.
In ancient Egypt, in Persia and in China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths shared by men and women.
If you're talking to someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space is sent down almost immediately after receiving a signal.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
It takes more than 100 feet of super rocket to install satellites and telescopes in space.
The wheel has changed the world in such a remarkable way that the biggest change has given us a more convenient and faster vehicle.
It brought trains and cars and all kinds of transportation.
Below it are the mid-size animals, the rabbits and antelope, and the medium-sized cats and animals that hunt deer.
Finally, there are a lot of little cats (including released pet cats) that eat much smaller prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the notion that each cat has a special task that prevents them from competing with other cats, and that's the notion that each cat has a gap.
Lions are the most social cats and animals that live in groups.
It's made up of about one or three of its peers, male adults, and as many as 30 females and cubs.
Females have a close relationship with each other because sisters and daughters come mainly from large families.
A pride of lions behaves remarkably similar to a lion, but not like a pack of wolves or dogs, which are also lethal to hunting.
A tiger is like a versatile athlete (but not very well) who can climb high, swim high, jump long distances, and pull down to five times as strong as a human being.
The tiger is a pride of lions, leopards, jaguars -- only these four cats and animals can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's roar, but it's like a gurgling, screaming sentence.
Ocelots enjoy eating small animals, which, if possible, usually hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds that are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their scent to hunt for prey, to find prey, to smell where they were.
Oslots have bright night vision that enables them to see even in the dark, and they can move very carefully: they hunt their prey in a way that melts into their environment.
When a small group of organisms (a small group of organisms) is separated from the major groups that have spread out (which either move to the mountains or to the rivers or to a new island, which cannot easily be moved), they realize that they are in a different environment than they were before.
Since these new environments have different resources and competitors, they need different characteristics and adaptations in order for new populations to have strong competition.
The population didn't change at all, but it still needs the same adaptation as before.
And over time, as new people began to adapt to their new environment, they began to look different and different from other people.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups would seem so different that they could not be called the same species.
We call this process species eruption, which means the formation of a new species, which is an inevitable consequence, and it's an important part of evolution every week.
Plants create the oxygen that we breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that we breathe.
Plants make their food through photosynthesis, using the sun, and they also provide shade.
We build houses out of trees, we make clothes out of plants, most of the food we eat is vegetables, and without plants, animals can't survive.
Mossaurus was the top predator of his day, so there was nothing to fear but the other Mossaurus.
The long jaws were filled with more than 70 very sharp teeth and these teeth were added to the roof of the mouth, which means that no one could escape if he passed in front of them.
I'm not sure, but my tongue may have been split, and I've eaten turtles, big fish, other Mossaur, and maybe even human flesh.
They attacked everything that came into the water, and they couldn't even get a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaur.
Their food was generally familiar to us, but some of the Roman banquet materials were unusual and strange, like rodents, peacocks, snails, and Dormouses.
The other difference is that the poor and the women sat down to eat, and the rich men got together to share their dinners, and they loved to lie back and eat.
An ancient Roman meal could not contain food from the United States or Asia that came to Europe a few centuries later.
For example, they did not eat corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple that they considered to be the House of God to all the gods they believed in.
They would bring sacrifices to God, and the priests would strive to meet his demands through rituals and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Special pyramidal towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built to be part of the temple.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
The Hebrew family's life was almost outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard, shops were just street vendors, and stones were used to build houses.
There was no big forest in Canaan, so the trees were very expensive.
In the Norwegian adventures, they say Erik the Red was deported from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed farther west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
The Eskimos, regardless of his discovery, were already there at that time.
Although each country belonged to Scandinavia, there was a lot of difference between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen a film called National Tresser, you might think it's a treasure map on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true, even if there's something on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
"On the back of the Declaration of Independence, we have the letter "July 4, 1776," which is upside down at the bottom of the document."
No one knows who wrote it, but this large parchment document was rolled out early.
So it's very likely that I just labeled it.
The D-Day landing and the follow-up fighting freed northern France, but the South was still not free.
It was ruled by the French, "Vish" and "Vish", who did not fight the invaders in 1940 with the Germans and the French who chose to strengthen them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded the south of France, and the invasion was called "Dream Operation."
In just two weeks, the U.S. military and the Free French were on the move to Germany, freeing the south of France.
Civilization is a very large group of people working together, a single culture shared by society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin cyvilis, which means citizen, and the Latin cybias, which means city or state, to define the scale of society.
Cultural culture means the traditions of knowledge by generations, the remnants of cultural footprints and the spread of justice.
A few cultures often disappear without any meaningful historical evidence and are not considered a proper civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, 13 states, according to the Articles of the Union, formed a central government whose only component was power, not strong.
Because Congress had no tax money, and there were no state administrations or judiciaries, it often had to rely on uncooperative state authorities to enforce the law.
Congress also had no right to invalidate state tax laws and tariffs.
These terms had to have unanimous consent in every state to be able to correct them, and most of the state representatives who ignored the central government were absent from the conference.
The Italian football team is number two on a team that won the world with the German football team, and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports events include football, baseball, basketball, handballs, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and the F1 auto race.
Winter sports is the most popular in the north, and sometimes Italians participate in international events or in the Olympics.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands, the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because of the army of the islands that Japan has, the geography of Japan is often called "health."
Taiwan began in the 15th century by European sailors calling it Ilha Formosa, a beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan, brought about a change in the way grain is produced, hired Chinese workers to produce rice and sugar through replanting farming.
In 1683, the Ching dynasty took control of the west and north coasts of Taiwan and declared Great Britain the territory of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After losing the Battle of the First Central War in 1895, the government signed the Simonosseki Treaty, which gave the country the sovereignty over Taiwan and allowed it to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three major structures: Intihuana, the Temple of the Sun, and a temple with three windows.
Most of the buildings just on the edge were rebuilt so that the tourists could better understand what it was like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and so far the restoration work is continuing.
For example, the world's most common static burn photo format is 35 millimeters, which was the size of a film that was used around the end of the analog film age.
It's being produced to this day, but more importantly, its cross section has been inherited into the image sensor of a digital camera.
It's a little confusing, but 35 millimeter formats are actually 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.
So this is the same thing as the most simple number ratio, divided by 12 is three:two.
Several general formats (e. g. APS formats) are equivalent or almost identical to this width ratio.
Three thirds of the laws that are widely abused and often ridiculed are simple guidelines for dynamics, maintaining the order of the image.
This law specifies that the most effective position for positioning the main subject is the point where the lines across the image, perpendicular and horizontal, intersect.
At this time in European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was thoroughly investigated.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound European countries into religion despite differences in language and customs.
Its overwhelming power affects everyone from the king to the common man.
According to one of the main doctrines of Christianity, wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the money money fund of the church exists for that reason in particular.
The core power of the church has remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and the power and the money side has given rise to doubts as to whether this doctrine is proper.
Soon after the war broke out, the British began a sea line against Germany.
Although these barriers violated the international law commonly accepted by several international agreements in the last two centuries, the strategy proved effective in blocking important military and private resources.
The U.K. has mined the high seas so that no ships can enter the oceans as a whole, putting them at risk to neutral ships.
Because of the limited response to this strategy, the Germans expected similar responses to the unlimited submarine war.
In the 1920s, the dominant trait in most citizens and states was peacefulism and isolationism.
The nations who have lived through the first world war and the horrors of their former lives have prayed that they will never experience such a situation again in the future.
In 1884 Tesla moved to the United States to get a job from Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with a copy of a recommendation that Charles Banner wrote to Thomas Edison, and a four-cent full estate.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of representing different times, and each period or state of power in China was distinguished by a dynasty.
There was also a period of unrest that was divided into different parts of the dynasty, and the most well-known period was the period of the three states, the period of 60 years between one country and the other.
During this period, a fierce war broke out between many of the nobles fighting for the throne.
The Third World was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, and thousands of people died fighting to get the highest place in the city.
The use of metrics, the transition from absoluteism to Republicanism, the rise of nationalism and the idea that the state is owned by many people, not by one ruler, has had a lot of impact on society and politics.
And since the revolution, jobs have opened up to all male volunteers, opening the way for the most ambitious and successful people to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because the current empowerment-based class is being used instead of the class.
The French Revolution also inspired the working class in other countries who are under a lot of pressure to revolutionize themselves.
Muhammad was deeply interested in going beyond the life of this inner life, and he often used a cave known as "Hera" in the mountains of Nure for meditation.
The cave, with its centuries-long waves, is very clear about Muhammad's religious nature.
This cave, situated on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if you know it exists, it's not easy to find it, once you're inside the cave, it's complete isolation.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky that surrounds the mountains, and you can't see or hear the outside world in this cave.
The great pyramid of journalists is one of the only seven wonders in the world that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of the many great pyramid structures built to honor the dead Pharaoh.
"Giza Peteau" or "Giza Necropolis" has several pyramids, several small tombs, several temples and Sphinx."
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Kupu, and the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate Kufu's wife and family.
The "" up-and-down" sign looks like a V-shirt, and the "down" sign looks like a rectangle with no staples or floor surfaces.
It's going to start at the end of the bow and turn on the bow, and it's going to start at the bow hanger, and it's going to turn off the bow.
It's usually a softer sound, while the downbeat is a stronger, more confident sound.
You can mark yourself with a pencil, but the bow that's drawn is for musical purposes, so it's usually to be kept.
The terrified French king Louis XVl, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two little children (11-year-old Terez and 4-year-old Charles) and his younger sister, Princess Elizabeth, on October 6, 1789, were forced from Versailles to Paris by a group of women workers.
The king and queen returned to Paris surrounded by crowds screaming and threatening them in their carriages.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the mob shook the head of a royal guard murdered at the Palace of Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The cost of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines was paid by Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay off much of their spending, and through Wall Street banks, bonds under the name of the Philippine government attracted attention.
Of course, the initial profit derived from long-term exploitation of the Filipino people will form the basic interests of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you need to know how to create a creative order.
The period of events is usually called the Middle Ages, a period in the history of Europe that corresponds to the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries.
In the late Middle Ages, the medieval peak of good deeds and early Middle Ages ended in the customary period of 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a wide range of practical ideas, from technology-based or technical obligations to the exact sense that human destiny is driven by fundamental reasonings related to the laws of science and the statements of technology.
"Most of the interpretations of technical determinism have two concepts: that the development of technology itself is more powerful than culture or politics, and that technology is not socially controlled, but it's an essential "influential" effect on society."
For example, someone might argue that cars must lead to road development.
However, a national road network has developed new ways of reducing the cost of car ownership because a few cars do not work economically.
Also, when many people own cars, road accidents increase, along with new technologies to restore damaged bodies in health care.
Romanticism had many elements of cultural determinism that were influenced by writers like Goethe, Pihite, Schlesegel.
In the sense of romanticism, it was better to form individuals, to grow the customs and cultures associated with the geography over time, to be socially compatible, and eventually to create and distribute laws.
Constance was considered the fashion capital of the feudal European era, since Paris was known as the fashion capital of the modern era.
The fame of luxury origin began about 400 years ago and reached around 1100.
In the 12th century, Constantinople fell because the Crusaders came back with gifts like silks and spices that were more valuable than those sold in the Byzantine market.
Then the fashion capital was converted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th centuries.
In the early days, the dress was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
But because the exchange was slow, the Western style could have been 25 to 30 years from now.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and as a result of the Crusades, one of the great developments was that people began to lock their clothes with buttons.
Making a living is farming to produce only as much food as a farmer and his family needs.
Agronomous agriculture is a simple, organic system that uses its own seeds, such as the rotation of crops or other relatively simple technologies, to maximize its yield.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in self-inflicted farming and are still available in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together similar people who feel alienated from social norms that allow them to develop their own identity.
Subculture can be distinguished by the age, race, class, position and / or gender of members.
The characteristics that clearly distinguish subculture are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, and may be the combination of these elements.
Members of the subculture often show their belonging through fashion, mannerism, and distinctive and symbolic styles, including certain slangs.
One of the most common ways to show the importance of socialization is to use the example of a few unfortunate children who were not socialized by adults, because of neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse while they were growing up.
Some of these children are called 'wild children'; some of them are imprisoned; many of them are locked up by their parents; in some cases, they are caused by the failure of parents to accept their child's serious intellectual and physical defects.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Some children are claimed to have been raised by animals, others to have lived themselves in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, wild babies behave like animals that need almost entirely special care, such as fear and indifference to humans.
Project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, and scanning takes one step further.
Scaffolding is more like an assistant than a learning method, such as using up-to-date computer programs or starting new projects to help people learn new things.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, and in other words, the teacher can be a non-synthetic form, but the little paper of Microsoft Office can be human.
The virtual structure is built on software and is designed to ask, post, and explain processes that may be difficult for students to handle themselves alone.
The reason children receive trust protection is that it varies widely from neglect to abuse and even robbery.
Every child has to grow up in an parenting, protective, educational environment, but that's not the case.
We see foster care as a safety zone for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, kind care, stable education, reliable health care.
A home trust should be able to provide all the essential elements that are not met in an existing home.
The Internet has all the collective communication and communication between people.
The Internet's distinctive nature leads to additional dimensions of use and satisfaction in terms of accessibility.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" were presented as an important motivation for using the Internet.
As Aimee and Maccode examined the audience's response to the website, they also identified personal involvement and continued relationships as new motivations.
Using video recording, we made an important discovery about the minute faces that last only a few millimeters, the interpretation of facial movements.
And in particular, they're able to accurately interpret the face, and they're going to be able to detect whether a person's lying or not.
Oliver Saxe in his "President's Speech" shows that people have taken the integrity of the speech precisely, even though it may not be understood because of brain damage.
He even suggested that animals like dogs have this ability to analyze human behavior.
In 20th-century studies, there are two groups of genetic mutations that are hidden or appear.
Mutations create new species of genes, and selection removes genes from the grass.
Separation and reassembling mixes the variation between the two gene plants in each generation.
In Savannah, it's not easy for primates with similar digestive organs to fill amino acids in their natural plant resources.
And this failure has serious consequences of low growth function, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources are the proteins of leaves and beans and plants, but they're hard to digest if we don't season them.
In contrast, animal foods like ants and termites and eggs not only are easily digested, but also provide high-quality proteins that contain essential amino acids.
"It's not surprising, given all the circumstances, that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in the same way that the savanna chimps do today."
Hibernation is the process of deliberately waking up during normal sleep periods and then sleeping after a brief period of 10 to 60 minutes.
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to restore consciousness without fully waking you.
If you turn off the alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it in the far corner of the room so that you can get out of bed and turn off the alarm yourself.
Other bio-based options include forcing people to take in a large amount of water before bedtime (particularly tea known as water or diuretics) and urinate.
One person's levelness has to do with the amount of anxiety inherent in his body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive energy there will be in life, and everyone has the ability to find absolute peace and contentment.
The only obstacle to this goal is the anxiety and negative inclination within us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on Buddha's teachings, but it's extended based on the idea of love of the Great Buddhist and a lot of the technology of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is theoretically very simple, it's made up of the ways of love, of yoga, meditation and everyone.
And if you do Kundalni yoga, you break up the Kundalini energy through yoga posture, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, visualizing various gods to clean energy channels, activate Chakra, and create enlightenment rites.
In World War II, Germany was a common enemy, and it led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States.
With the passing of two years, former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
The Cold War was going to last for the next 40 years, and it would be a real war on the battlefields of Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other areas in Africa.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to reroute and retreat along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans were abandoned almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet soldiers were set up on the border of peace, the Soviet-Polish nonaggression and other international treaties that invaded eastern Poland and then invaded the Russian East.
Using ships to transport goods is the most efficient way to transport many people and mass goods across the ocean.
The Navy's mission is traditionally to ensure the country's ability to carry people and goods, while at the same time it has a job that prevents its enemies from carrying people and goods.
One of the most remarkable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, where Americans were trying to move people and resources across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, which uses the U-boats mainly, tried to stop this.
If the Allies had failed, the Germans would have been able to conquer the British as well as any other Europe.
The goat breeding seems to have started about 10,000 years ago in the Jarros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient civilizations and tribes began to defend them for easy use of milk, wool, meat and leather.
The cattle goats are generally grouped in hills and grazing areas, where shepherds, as they are more commonly known as shepherds, are cared for by most children and adolescents.
Chariot was built in England in the early 16th century.
The carriage was just made of parallel wood planks, but nevertheless, the horses could be faster and more heavily loaded than the rougher roads of the day.
In order to fix the tracks, the needles were introduced quite early, but gradually it turned out to be more efficient when the tracks were on top of the iron rods.
It was a common practice, but iron made the wooden wheels of the carriage wear more.
Over time, wooden wheels were replaced by steel wheels, and finally, in 1767, a railway only made of steel was introduced.
The first known mode of transportation for mankind was walking, and two million years ago, Homo erectus came along, and we started walking upright.
Their ancestors, Australalo Pythecus, did not make upright walk the way they did.
Although Sahelandropus may have been a member of the group earlier than seven million years ago, the characteristic of this family's walking is well illustrated in the fossil record of Australalopitecus, which appears from 4.2 million to 3.9 million years ago.
We can start a more ecologically friendly life, we can engage in environmental movements, and we can become activists to reduce some of the suffering that the future brings.
It's like a symptom therapy in many cases, but if you don't want to stop with a temporary solution, you have to find the source of the problem and disable it.
The fact that the world has changed so much because of man's advances in science and technology is clear enough, and due to overpopulation and the luxurious way of life of the human race, the problem has become greater.
After Congress adopted on July 4, it was sent to the John Dunlap printery a few blocks away, one of the books signed and signed by President John Hancock and the scribe Charles Thomas.
During the night, between 150 and 200 pieces of printed material, now called Dunlab Broadside, were made.
On July 8th in the front yard of the Declaration, the first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his unit in New York on July 9th, and the manuscript arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlab Broads, still known to exist, are the oldest manuscripts of this document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survive to this day, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think of birds as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's still a lot of things that make a bird look like a dinosaur.
They have scales and claws on their feet, they lay eggs, they walk on two hind legs like Tyrannosaur.
Most computers used today use the computer to manipulate information through binary coding.
It can only have two values (i. e. zero or one), and it's called binary (bits) in computer technical terms.
An addiction to the body may not appear immediately, symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The most obvious sign of endocrinosis might be the case where you're left open a container of medicine or toxic household chemicals.
Check your chart for specific emergency care guidelines on certain poisons.
The term bug is the term by which entomologists have elaborated on these kinds of insects.
It's derived from an insect, an insect that's very suitable for a person you've known since.
Both the chimpanzees and the robins are chronic insects that adapt to their host's nest or habitat.
MS, the most common neurologic disease among young and middle - aged adults, is reported to be about 400,000 cases across the United States.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system that makes up the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
Couples may decide that raising a baby is not the best thing to do for each other or for the child's benefit.
These couples can choose to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, they give up on their parents so that other couples can take over the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works through scientific methods, which actually leads to most scientific research.
But experiments are about removing one or more hypotheses, asking questions, observing and leading to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused specifically on classical texts and Latin Bibles.
In psychology and science, we adopted Aristotle's view of all matter.
As our knowledge of Greek declined, we found that the West was cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms that are observed in menstruation and behavior depend heavily on the presence of productivity and internal cycles through biological clocks.
Most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, have periodic rhythms that are not just reactions to external periodic signals.
A biological clock is a self-sustaining kicker that can sustain its own continuous cycle, even if it doesn't have a signal from outside.
Hirsch and Chase were one of the leading studies that suggested that DNA is a genetic material.
Hirsch and Chase used waves, or viruses, to plant bacteria in their DNA.
They did two experiments to identify the protein of the wave while the radioactive person was in the paz DNA or radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on whether the affected cells are seed cells or not, the kind of variation, the importance of affected genetic fragments.
Only mutations in the reproductive system can be passed on to children, and in other places mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism of nature draws people who are interested in nature for the purpose of seeing the landscape, including plants and animal wildlife.
An example of field activity is hunting, fishing, photography, observing birds and research into parks and ecosystems.
One example is the trip to Organathuang in Borneo, the photographs, the learning, and so forth.
Every morning, people leave small rural villages by car to go to work, and they pass by their jobs, where they have just left.
The dynamic transport shuttle somehow allows everyone to connect with and support private transport systems.
Now, scientific data shows that this carbon economy, on a huge scale, has driven the biosphere out of a stable state that has helped us evolve over the last two million years.
Everybody's involved in society, they're using the transportation system, and almost everybody's complaining about the transportation system.
In developed countries, we rarely hear similar complaints about water problems or broken bridges.
Why is the transportation system causing that complaint, and why is it that every day you lose your expectations, you know, traffic engineers are all incompetent people, or something more fundamental is going on?
The traffic flow is a study of individual drivers and vehicles moving between two points and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty, so it's hard to study traffic flow.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a fairly consistent range, so traffic flows have some proper consistency and can be roughly expressed mathematically.
To better express the flow of traffic, the relationship was set between (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) the three main characteristics of speed.
This relationship helps design, design and operate road facilities.
Insects are the first animals that were able to fly in the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can fold their wings behind their body.
This gives them smaller areas where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the dragonfly and the fly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Arisgo claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that the solar system, including the sun, was right, but many did not believe in him.
The Earth feels as if it's not moving, so at first glance it seems right, doesn't it?
The Amazon is the second largest river on Earth, and the second largest one is the second, and more than eight times as much water flows through it as the second largest one.
Amazon is also the widest river on earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that pours into the ocean from the Earth's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River mainstream has a length of 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) which is owed by means of thousands of small rivers.
Until the last moment of the High Kingdom, the pyramid construction continued, but size and technical excellence could never outdo the reporter pyramid.
The ancient New Kingdom Egyptians marveled at the monumental architecture of their ancestors, which was well over a thousand years by that time.
The Vatican City population is about 800, the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
And Italian, unlike Latin, which is commonly used in religious ceremonies, is a common language spoken by most people who work in the state.
Every citizen in the Vatican City is a Roman Catholic.
From ancient times, people had known basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver and copper, because they were all relatively simple to be found in nature in their natural form and to be mined with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that all matter was composed of a mixture of one or more of four elements: land, water, air and fire.
It was similar to the four states of matter: solid, liquid, gas, plasma in the same order, but Aristotle also came up with the theory that they turn into new pure materials and form what we see.
The alloy is basically a mixture of more than two metals. Remember, there's a lot of elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are other metals like silver and gold.
We also have alloys that contain a little bit of non-metallics like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter made up of tiny particles called atoms.
An atom is incredibly small, so a few trillion atoms can fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, pencils appear and pencils remain a good tool for many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of a new writing system, the pencils were used less frequently, and the pencils were pushed into less important positions.
Now, people don't have to write messages on the computer screen, and they don't have to get close to pencil sharpening.
People are just wondering what's going to happen to the keyboard if something new happens.
A fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes a lot of energy to combine a nucleus with a lot of protons and neutrons.
When you divide the nucleus again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to divide themselves without very small external influences or external conditions.
"The moon's surface is made up of stones and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the Crust."
The earth's crust is about 70 kilometers close, and 100 kilometers deep at a distance.
It's thinner under Mary and thicker under the plateau.
Since the crust is thinner, Mary may be closer to the surface, which is easier for the lava to rise above the surface.
The theory of content focuses on what attracts people to certain behaviors or behaviors.
These theories suggest that people have a certain need for curses that are built into them until they reach adulthood.
They look at certain people who make you want to do what you do, and they look at what makes you not do what you do in your environment.
The two popular theories are Maslow's stylistic theory and Hertzberg's theory of logic.
"In general, two actions may appear as the manager starts leading his former colleagues. He tries to remain "one of his employees" at one end of the spectrum."
This type of manager has a hard time making unwanted decisions, assigning disciplinary measures, evaluations and responsibilities to people, and asking them to take responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, it turns into an unaware individual who thinks he should change everything that the team has done and make it his own way.
In the end, the team's sex card is the leader's responsibility.
This action leads to confusion between active leaders and members of the community.
The virtual team maintains the same standard of excellence as the existing team, but there's a subtle difference.
Virtual teams often serve as contact points for real members.
They're able to meet with their teams at changing times that the local management team doesn't understand, so they often have more autonomy than the existing ones.
The existence of a real "transparent team" (Lison and Rafasto, 1989, page 109) is also a unique component of the virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" is the management team that each member reports, which sets the standards for each member."
Why is it that it takes a lot of time to create a learning organization, and one goal is innovation to implement an organized learning concept.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the organization's office, creativity and creativity can be achieved.
As a result, a process in which organizations work together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovation process to meet customer needs.
For organizations to be innovative, leadership must create not only innovation cultures, but shared knowledge and organized learning.
Angel (2006) describes the approach called Continium, which helps the organization achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides the physical evidence for the theoretical approach to cognitive research that narrows down the field and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain disease and behavior helps scientists do research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies has enabled us to observe and examine the structure and processes of the brain that we had never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and data to build a simulation model that helps us understand the process in our hearts.
AI is a powerful reminder of science fiction, but it's a very important part of computer science dealing with computer behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
AI studies include studies where machines auto-automaticize tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, notes, voices, facial recognition include control, planning, schedule and customer diagnosis and answering questions.
These became separate disciplines that focused on providing solutions to problems in real life.
The AI system is now being used frequently in the economic, medical, engineering and military sectors, as you can see in many home computer and video game software.
In general, teachers want to take their students to places where they don't need to travel by bus.
Technology helps them to do virtual field learning, so that they can sit in their classrooms, see museum displays, see aquariums, and appreciate beautiful works of art.
Virtual field learning is a great way to look back and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website for state travel, where the website is remodeled and the old version is left online in scrapbook form.
Blogs also help students improve their writing, and students often start blogs with poor grammar and spelling, but the existence of readers generally changes those things.
Most students are the most critical audience, so blog writers are starting to try to improve writing in order to avoid criticism.
The blog also uses the need for students to pay more attention to their surroundings, to make them smart and interesting.
Blogging is a tool that enhances cooperation and encourages students to expand their learning beyond traditional school life.
"The proper use of blogs is to respond positively to Internet data, thus promoting analytical and critical thinking on the part of students, so that they can define their position in other people's writings and achieve their perspectives on certain topics."
Ottawa is the fascinating capital of Canada with a double language, and Ottawa's various art galleries and museums illuminate Canada's past and present.
In the far south, there are Niagara Falls, and in the north, Muskoka, the beauty of nature, which has not been pioneered.
All of this is what outsiders call true Canada, which makes Ontario stand out.
Large areas in the north are rarely populated, and some are desolate areas that are rarely inhabited.
People who are going to surprise you: there are more African-American people in the United States than there are Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located along the east coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean.

Women: I recommend that every female traveler is married regardless of whether or not he or she is married.
It's helpful to wear a ring.
Women need to know that cultural differences can lead to what is considered to be cultural harassment and that arm snatching and so on is not uncommon.
Say no to men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural car or not, harassment can't be overlooked!)
In the tenth century B.C.E., the modern city of Casa Blanca was founded by the Ververian fishermen and used by the Phoenicians, Romans andmen as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed this place and rebuilt it in the name of Casa Branca, but they left it after the 1755 earthquake.
Moroccan Sultan rebuilded the city of Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who made the trade here called it Casablanca.

In old Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan products, such as tanning, ceramics, leather products, water cigarettes and various kinds of things, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town on the east side of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, especially in the cities and most of the villages.
Goma is pretty safe, but if you go outside to Goma, you have to do research to understand the ongoing conflict in the Northkibu region.
It is also the base camp on the climbs of the Niiragongo volcano and the cheapest mountain gorilla to Africa.
The average price for a short-run ride is 500 Congo francs.
In combination, the "Timbutu" was used as a metaphor for exotic and remote areas.
Today Timbuktu is a poor town, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
Because of the effects of desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the World Cultural Heritage List in 1990.
This was one of the most important expeditions in Africa's special PBS special collection of Henry Louis Gates.
It's a city more Arab than Africa, so it's in stark contrast with other cities in Mali.
Kruger National Park is in the northeast of South Africa, formed along the border of Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, and on the south, on the Croquedale River.

The bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoint is finished.
The Guarani are the most important indigenous people, the anti-peam-hunters, who live east of modern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as Goikuru and Payagua, who survived hunting, gathering, fishing.
Paraguay, called the Indis Giant Castle, was born in the 16th century as a result of the nemesis of the Spanish conquerors and the natives.
The Spanish began a three-century colonial era.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has maintained much of its indigenous character and identity.

Its official currency is a FKP set equal to the value of one British pound (GBP).
It's the only bank on the island right across from the FIC West Store.
British pounds are common throughout the island and can be used largely for Stanley's credit card and U.S. dollars.
In that library, you can use British and U.S. currency, but your credit cards are not available. Please check with the owner in advance if you want to determine what the acceptable means of payment are.
It's almost impossible to get the Falkland currency out of the island, so return it before you leave the island.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is a tropical region, and in summer it's usually over 30 degrees Celsius.

Many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, but wildness remains for wild animals, and they shouldn't feed them or disturb them.
Park authorities say at least 100 yards from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards from all wild animals.
No matter how easy it looks, wild ox, elk, moose, bear and almost all large animals can be attacked.
Each year dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep the right distance, because these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so keep the distance.
In addition, because smell can attract bears and other wild animals, you have to clean up the camp without carrying or cooking the food that smells.

A traveler can encounter an animal pest that is not uncommon in the area where he lives.
Insect pests, food can rot, cause inflammation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
Diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill people by force, are usually not considered pests.
It provides opportunities to buy products that are exempted from taxes and consumer taxes in certain areas.
Travelers in countries where heavy taxes are being taxed can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially when buying liquor or tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont on isolated mountain terrain is known as the most difficult to drive on the Buffalo Pittsburgh highway.
If you're not used to driving country roads, you have to be careful about steep slopes, narrow lanes and steep curves.
The air speed limit is significantly lower than the previous and later stages-- normally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)-- and within that interval the speed limit is much more important than the other range.
Interestingly, mobile phone service is more powerful here than many other points in this path, such as Pennsylvania Wiiz.
Germany's pastry is pretty good, and in Bavaria, like the southern neighbor Austria, there's a lot of butter in it and a lot of butter in it.

The back is the footrest of the passenger's foot that's stretched on both sides of the saddle.
This device gives the rider much more stability, but because of the fact that his foot is stuck, he may have a safety problem.
If the rider falls off the horse and has a foot on the back, if the horse runs away, you can be dragged there, and you can take safety precautions to minimize this risk.
First of all, most of the riders have a heel, and the soles are smooth and narrow.
Then there is the safety bar in which some saddles, especially British saddles, can fall from the saddles if the rider is pulled backward.

The active snow sport, which includes skis and snowboards, is a popular sport that involves skis and snowboards and skis down snowy terrain.
"ski travel is a way for enthusiasts to enjoy what they call "skibams" -- they plan their vacation as a time to ski from one particular place to another."
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings that depict skiers date back to 5,000 B.C.E.
The bow skis as a sport date back at least to the 17th century, when the first recreation ski club was established by the Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Skiing white patching: it's also called back country skiing, skiing tours, or ski hikes.
This activity has to do with alpine ski tours and climbing, but it usually does not include this, and in the latter case, it is done on steep terrain, and requires even harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski course as a similar hiking course.
Under good conditions, you can travel a little farther than you can walk, but without a well-scheduled track and heavy backpack, it will not be as fast as cross country skiing.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries.
However, Schengen Zone is rather like a country in this regard.
