This is a story about how we know what we know.
This is a story about this woman, Natalia Lipchinski.
She's a paleontologist, which means she's an expert in digging up things that died a very long time ago.
Natalia Ripchinski: Yeah, you call me "Dr. Dead."
Ltaff Nasa: And what I was interested in was the where she digs things out, and she works in the remote Canadian tundra, far above the Arctic Circle.
On a summer's day in 2006, she was at an excavation site called Fyles Leaf Bed, less than ten degrees from the latitudes of the North Pole.
NR: Wasn't that great? It wasn't a big deal, because I've been walking all day, I've been walking all day, I've been holding GPS and laptops in my backpack, and I've been walking all day, I've been holding fossils.
LT: And at some point, she realizes something.
Natalia: It was rusty, it was something that was about my palm in a rusty color.
It just fell to the ground.
Ltaff: At first, she thought it was just a piece of wood, because people had found fossils of prehistoric plants before in the Fyles Leaf Bed.
That night, I went back to camp.
Natalia: I took out my portable magnifying glass and looked at it a little bit more, and I realized that it doesn't look like it has a tree.
I thought it might be something that needs to be preserved, but it's really
It looked like bone.
LT: So over the course of four years, she continued to explore the area, and eventually collected 30 pieces of the same bone, most of which were really small pieces.
NR: It's not a big deal. It's all going to go into one zip-lock.
Ltiff: And she tried to fit the bones together like a puzzle.
But it was very difficult.
Natalia: I've carved so much that I've used sand and binders, but they didn't look good.
So in the end, I filmed it with a 3D scanner.
Latif: Oh! Natalia: Yeah, you did a good job, right?
LT: It was actually a much easier way.
Natalia: It was magical to make the pieces into one.
LN: How sure were you that these pieces were put together?
Was it possible that they didn't assemble well, or were they the bones of a little lovebird or something?
NR: Well, no, no, no, you did it right.
Ltaff: According to her, what she found was a tibia, a leg bone, and, to be precise, a mammal with a cracked hoof, an animal like a cow or a sheep.
But there were no two animals.
Because the bones were too big.
NR: It was a very large animal bone.
Ltiff: So what kind of animal is it?
While contemplating, she showed a piece to a colleague in Colorado and they gave her a good opinion.
Natalia: We sliced it out with a saw at the end, and in the middle of it came a really interesting smell.
LT: It was like a burning flesh.
The smell was the smell she smelled when she took a gross anatomy class: the smell of collagen.
Collagen plays a bone structure role.
And usually over time, it collapses.
But in this case, the North was preserved as a natural freezer.
And then, 1 or 2 years later, Natalia sees a colleague of mine, Mike Buckley, at a conference in Bristol, demonstrating that it's "collagen fingerprinting."
The content is that different species have slightly different collagen structures, so if you have the collagen structure of an unidentified bone here, you can compare it to the revealed species structure, and you might find a match.
So she sent a piece to a colleague, FedEx.
NR: Yeah, I'm going to check the shipping. It's important.
Ltiff: And he analyzed and compared it to thirty-seven species of modern mammal.
I found a match.
According to the investigation, this bone was three and a half million years ago, and the owner of this bone, which Natalia dug out in the Arctic Circle...
It was a camel.
NR: At the time, I was like, what? It's amazing -- if it's true.
Ltiff: So we did the tests with the other pieces, and the results were all the same.
But according to the size of the bones found, this camel is 30 percent larger than the modern camel.
So this camel is nine feet tall and weighs about a ton.
Yes.
Natalia discovered a giant Arctic camel.
Now, when you heard the word camel, you heard the idea that you would think, "Bubong camels in East Asia, in Central Asia, in Asia, in Asia, in Asia, in Asia, in Asia, in Asia, in Asia,
There may be in your mind a postcard of this kind of single-bong camel, which is typical of desert animals, living in hot deserts, living in places like the Middle East and the Sahara, with big hump on their backs, storing pollination for long desert treks, and going over the dunes on the sand dunes on them.
So how did these guys get to the North Pole?
Well, scientists have known for a long time that what was discovered before Natalia's discovery was that camels were actually from the United States.
This is the first time a camel has been found here.
It was the first camel that existed about forty million to forty-five million years ago, and it only inhabited North America. It turns out there were twenty species, and there could be more.
LT: Can you tell the difference between all the camels?
NR: Yeah, the camels are different in size.
Some camels have really long necks, and they're actually giraffe-like camels.
Ltiff: What species has a crocodile-like snout?
Natalia: The primitive camel was really, really small, almost like a rabbit.
Ltiff: What? A rabbit-sized camel?
Natalia: It's a camel of your primitive level.
It's hard to see it's a camel.
Latif: Oh my God, I want to raise a rabbit camel.
Natalia: Me too. Sounds good, doesn't it?
Ltaff: And about three to seven million years ago, a species of one camel passed into South America, where it evolved into a llama and alpaca, and the other species passed through the Bering Bridge and into Asia and Africa.
And at the end of the Ice Age, North American camels went extinct.
The scientists knew all this, but they couldn't fully explain what Natalia had found in the north.
For example, in terms of temperature, the polar regions are the exact opposite of the Sahara.
To be precise, three and a half million years ago, on average, it was about twenty degrees Celsius warmer than it is now.
So the Arctic Circle would have been a forest of Ahandae, like the Yukon or Siberia today.
But it was still an area where winter lasted for six months, and the pools of water froze and the pools froze.
It would have been where the blizzard would have been.
It would have been an area with a polar night that lasted twenty-four hours.
How... how?
How could this Saharan superstar survive in the Arctic climate?
Natalia and her colleagues come up with one hypothesis.
And it was a pretty intimidating idea.
What if what we think is that camels can adapt well in places like the Sahara have actually evolved to survive the winter?
What if the wide feet of a camel were not meant to cross the desert, but to walk on snow?
What if the camel's hump -- it's big news for me, not that it's water, that it's fat, and it helps me get through a six-month winter when there's not enough to eat?
And what if, later, when the camels crossed the Bering Bridge and, long after, they remodeled these features for the wintering of the hot desert environment?
For example, it's going to help you in the back or in the hot climate, because there's a lot of fat in your body, like a fat bag, so you don't need an insulator that wraps around your body.
The hump on the back makes it easy to block the heat.
Sounds like a strange sound, but the intrinsic reason why camels can live in the desert can be evidence that camels lived in the Arctic Circle in the past.
I’m not really the first to tell this story.
Others see this as a wonder of evolutionary biology, or it will be the key to future climate change.
But the reasons I like this story are different.
I think this is a story about us, a story about how we look at the world and how it changes.
I'm a historian.
And I've come to realize that a lot of scientists are like historians.
It’s the same as proving the past.
Scientists talk about life in the universe, on Earth, on Earth.
And as a historian, I've been thinking about where this story is going to go.
Natalia: We make hypotheses, and we think that hypotheses are true, like camels live in the desert, don't they?
That's the right story! I totally believed it.
As you can see, camels live in the desert.
Rataf: But at some point, you find very little evidence, and you're going to find a little bit of evidence.
From that little thing, everything you've ever known can be turned upside down.
In this case, a scientist discovered a piece that he thought was a tree, and that made the scientific community come up with a completely new and counterintrospective theory about why this Dr. Seuss-like animal looks like this.
And for me, the idea of a camel was completely reversed.
It's a ridiculously rare animal that can only grow in certain environments, to an animal that has traveled the world and arrived in the Sahara, and it's actually no wonder it's anywhere in the world.
This guy is Avery.
How are you feeling?
Here, eat this one.
Ajuri is currently taking a short break during the regular performance. It is a performance at the Radio City Music Hall.
I'm not kidding.
Anyway -- Ajuri is here to tell you that the story of this world is dynamic.
It's something we need to adapt and reimagine.
Right, Ajuri?
And in fact, one small piece of bone has renewed the world we see.
Thank you.
Today's computers are so amazing that it's hard to recognize how terrible they are at the same time.
I'm going to show you today the problems of computers, and I'm going to show you how to solve them with neuroscience.
First, let me tell you about an important event that happened to me on a cold night in Harlem.
I was sitting in a bar outside the Columbia University, where I majored in computer science and neuroscience, and I was in a conversation with a friend at a bar that one day holograms would replace computers.
And as our conversation reached its climax, our friend's phone rang.
My friend pulled his phone down and looked down and started typing.
And he raised his eyes hard, and he looked at me and said, "Keep going. I'm listening."
But in the eyes of a friend, there was no heat, and the moment was already cold.
On the other side, another student took out his phone and put it out to the group.
He was handing over the photos on Instagram and was having fun laughing with the group.
It captivated me to feel bad, and at the same time, the fact that I was happy on the other side was the same technology.
And the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the content of the digital information didn't have a different result, but that I and my friends were separated and that sided with each other, just by the direction of the screen.
They were bonded on their phones, just like the ancients, sitting around a campfire, talking and building social skills.
I think the tools have to function like this.
It has to be an extension of the body.
And I think today's computers are the opposite.
Whether you're emailing your wife, composing a symphony, or comforting a friend, you're doing the same thing on the computer.
Face rectangles, touch buttons and menus to bring up other squares.
I think this is wrong, I think we can use a much more natural machine.
We have to use machines that do things in the real world.
We need to apply neuroscience principles to machines so that we don't go against our senses, but expand our senses.
There is such a machine right here.
This is Meta2.
Let's write it down.
I can see with my own eyes vividly the audience in front of you and my hands.
If you count to three, two, one, you'll see a realistic hologram, and in front of me, in a very realistic hologram, in front of the device that I'm using right now.
This hologram is the product that we're shopping for, the object of exploration, and it can be done with your hands, and it can be elaborated.
Iron Man is something to be proud of.
We'll see this machine again in a moment.
If you're like me, you're imagining what's possible with this technology, so I'm going to show you.
My mother is an architect, and naturally I thought about expressing architecture in 3D, not the blueprint of 2D as it is now.
Mothers touch graphics and opt for built-in decorations.
This is a real shot in Meta2.
The next example resonates with me, which is Professor Adam Ghazali's transparent brain project. I have received the UCSF's understanding.
As a neuroscience student, I've always imagined learning and memorizing complex brain structures with the help of machines, touching and playing with complex brain structures, and this technology is called amagorative reality.
But I think it's a process of expanding our body's capabilities with the help of machines, not the other way around.
Now...
In a few years, humanity will undergo a major transformation.
Humanity will begin to build a corresponding layer of digital information on top of the real world.
Imagine what this would call a change for a storyteller, a painter, a brain surgeon, an interior decorator, to us here.
And I think we should all work together, and through a lot of trials and efforts, to discuss the direction of creating this new reality, and thinking about how to expand the human experience, not just make it like a game or just fill it with information.
And I'm very passionate about this.
Now, let me tell you a little secret.
In about five years, this is not a minimized device, it's going to be improved in about five years into a thin glass band that projects holograms on the eye, and as we look at operating systems instead of hardware, I've always dreamed of creating iOS for the mind as a neuroscientist.
The development of this OS should be very careful, because as long as we use Windows, we will have a long time to live in the new OS in the future.
I don't know about you, but I'm afraid to live in Windows.
In order to find the most intuitive interface for users, we put neuroscience at the heart of design, and we can't see the design being squeezed out of the boardroom.
When designing, the principle we always think about is to look for “the most complex neural circuits.”
At every stage, we try to connect the mind's iOS with the intuition of the brain, and in other words, we're trying to build a computer that doesn't require any use-by.
We're building computers that we can use instinctively.
The following three design guidelines are for the new user experience
The things we're trying to do. The first and most important thing is that we're
You are an operating system in itself.
Traditional file systems are not complex and intuitive, forcing additional understanding into your brain.
That is, it does not go through the circuit with the least sense of disproportionateness.
In augmented reality, on the other hand, you can put a holographic TED screen here, an email on the other side, or you can use the spatial power of reality to pull a hologram.
You can take out the Tesla car you were shopping for, for the car that the legal team agreed to use before the talk.
OK, the brain fully understands this process.
The second rule is to call it “to see with the help.”
What do babies do when they get their attention?
I try to reach out and touch it.
This is how natural machines work.
It turns out that in order for a visual system to have a great effect, it has to feel the sense of self-reliance, where the body is in the system.
Therefore, if you can touch it yourself, you can understand not only the convenience of manipulation, but also the content more deeply.
Touch and see.
But experience alone is not enough.
We are social animals.
This is our third guideline: a bonfire of holograms that are told in the story.
By mirror neurons in the human body, we can immerse ourselves in the work of working with others by 3D looking at the faces and hands of others.
If you look at the video behind me, two meta-users play together in the same hologram, make eye contact with each other, not because of the device, but because of the device, they don't fall off each other.
Let's use the device again with the neuroscience that I talked about.
I'm back to iOS for the mentality.
This time, I will go even further, hold this device by hand, and then place it next to the desk.
I'm with you. I'm connected.
I can take this device and put it back in my place, depending on my space capabilities, because I'm an operating system.
Now that the sense of self-acceptance is working, I can break this device down into thousands of parts and touch the very sensor that's scanning my hand.
But I'm serious about watching it for myself, so I'm going to have a 3D call with my co-founder, Ray?
Ray, how are you?
I'm looking at this guy in 3D right in front of my eyes.
It's like it's real.
Thank you.
My mirror neuron says that this feature will replace the phone in the near future.
Ray, how are you?
Yes, we're live.
Ray, give me the holographic brain that I showed you here for the first time.
And this device, not just the phone, but it's going to change the way we work together.
Thank you.
Thanks, Ray.
What?
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the message I found in the bar in 2011: The future of computers is not stuck in square screens.
Right here, inside of us.
And what I can tell you today is that natural machines are not the science fiction of the future, but the 2016s.
Meta has already built this device, and hundreds of its executives, executives, designers, and engineers, will throw away all the monitors in the company until TED2017 and turn them into truly, truly, natural machines.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you guys.
CA: I have one question for you, augmented reality demonstrations, until last year, a couple of times before.
Each time, there was a debate among technicians about whether the demonstration was a real user's view.
It's about the field of view, and it's actually more visible than it is to see it as a device.
Is it what you see in the video?
Meron: Not as it is.
Not only that, but with a lot of adjustments, I took all the images with the camera in the actual lens.
I put a lot of effort into creating the video to give you the experience of actually using the device when you watch it.
CA: Thank you for your careful consideration.
Thank you very much. It's rewarding.
I come from Seattle, Washington, the most liberal, generous and progressive in America.
I grew up in a family that I believed in Seattle was the best.
My mother was an artist, my father was a college professor, and I'm really grateful for the upbringing that I was able to design my life in comfort.
In fact, I didn’t follow the way my parents wanted me to.
I was nineteen years old when I dropped out of college, I was kicked out, and I was a nuisance.
I went to see Professor Franchise Horne, whom I had been hoping for in my dreams.
I've been playing chamber music in the U.S. and Europe, and I've been traveling with a great jazz guitarist named Charlie Bird for two years.
At the end of my twenties, I became a member of the Barcelona Symphony Orchestra in Spain.
It's a wonderful life.
My parents never complained.
You gave me all the support.
It wasn't what they wanted.
My parents used to tell their neighbors and friends, "Our son is in a vacuum."
And I had a little uncomfortable conversation about my life, and I want to tell you.
I came back from Barcelona when I was twenty-seven, and it was Christmas, so I went to see my parents, and I was cooking in the kitchen with my mother.
My mother was so quiet.
Something was wrong.
And I said, "Mom, what are you thinking?"
He said, "Your father and I are really worried about you."
And I said, "Well, what should I be like right now?"
My mother said, "I really wish I could tell you all: Have you ever voted Republican?"
Yes, in fact, I was just a French Horn player who wasn't interested in politics.
But my parents knew what was going on, and there was some confusion.
I've become a big supporter of capitalism, and I'll tell you why.
It stems from my lifelong interest in poverty.
I remember when I first grew up in Seattle, when I first saw poverty.
We were a little bit below the middle class, but we weren't poor.
I couldn't get anywhere near it.
The first time I saw poverty was in the early 1970s, when I was seven years old.
I was just a normal kid.
I saw a picture of a kid my age in East Africa in National Geographic magazine, whose face was full of flies and his abdomen was dilated.
I knew he wouldn't live.
Some of you may remember that picture, even if it's not one.
It is to show the West the endless poverty of the world.
It haunted me until I was old enough to go to school, I dropped out of school, I went back in, I had a family.
And what happened to that child,
I wondered what would happen to people like that all over the world.
So even though I wasn't in college, I started studying, and I was trying to find the answer: What would happen to the poorest people in the world?
Would it have been worse? Would it have gotten better?
I found the answer, and it changed my life, and I'll share it with you.
Look -- most Americans believe that poverty is worse than it was in their childhood.
When Americans are asked, “Is global poverty a bad thing?” 70% of people say that hunger is worse than it was in the early 1970s.
But the truth is,
It changed my mind.
Since 1970, the share of hunger that lives on less than one dollars a day in the world has decreased by 80 percent, which is controlled by inflation.
Since I was a child, poverty in the world has declined by 80 percent.
I didn't even know.
That's really a miracle.
That's what we should celebrate.
It's the best record in human history to break poverty, and it happened in this era that we live in.
And when I found out, I wondered, how could it have been possible?
Because if you don't know why, you can't do it again.
If we knew why, we could save the other two million people in poverty, and that's our theme: Since I was a child, at least two billion people have been out of poverty.
I want the other two billion.
I tried to find the answer.
Not a political answer that I don’t care about.
I still don’t care about politics.
I was trying to find answers in every aspect of the economy.
And the answer is this.
Let's see why.
Here are five reasons 20 billion people have been able to get out of poverty.
The first is globalization.
Second: Free trade.
Third: Poverty rights
Fourth: Provisions of Law
Number five: create.
The massive free-business system that made it possible went around the world in the 1970s.
It's not naive.
Free business isn’t perfect, but it’s not all we need to do to make the world a better place.
But it's good.
It's not political.
Here's what I learned. This is a revelation.
Capitalism is not just about accumulation.
It's about the best of it, the aspirations, and a lot of the people who were on this stage talked about, and aspiration comes from dreams and is embedded in the free business.
We need to share it with more people, similar to the first one.
And I'm going to tell you a second story, because I think it's going to develop both the family and the world.
My favorite quote is an indication of what I've been saying, saving people from poverty, and here's: "The free market has created the greatest wealth in history."
They've lifted a billion poverty.
Who said this?
It's like Milton Friedman or Ronald Reagan.
No.
That's what President Obama said.
How do I remember?
I told you.
It's crazy.
I said, "Hallelujah."
But other than that, I said, "It's an opportunity."
You know what I was thinking?
In May 2015, at Georgetown University, we had an event where we participated as the main character.
And I think it's about the biggest problem facing the United States today.
I thought it was the answer, what is it? With these ideas, progress and conservatism, the people who need us the most.
I'm not saying we're in crisis, but the U.S. and other countries around the world are facing political polarization.
We're in a crisis.
It's not good. It's not right.
Last year, there was an article in the National Academy of Sciences, which is one of the most prestigious scientific journals in the West.
And this is an article about the political disparity that was published in 2014.
What is this? What do psychologists say about what they believe comes from love, and what does the other side believe is from hate?
The answer is a common conflict.
It can also be seen in Palestine and Israel.
The author of this article found that most Republicans and Democrats in the United States today suffer from political imbalances.
Today's political leaders believe that their motives are partisan and that the opposition is hatred.
Think about it.
A lot of people walk around and say, "You know, my ideas come from benevolence, I want to help others, but others are demons and they're disturbing me."
We're not going to be able to develop a group that has that imbalance.
It's impossible.
How do we solve it?
Let's be honest: there's a difference.
You can make the difference: really pure.
It needs a lot of investigation.
This is Jonathan Hyde, a TED stage veteran.
He is a professor of psychology at New York University.
He explores people's ideas, values and morality to see differences, and as he's shown, progressives and Democrats think different things are important.
For example, Jonathan Heit said that the Progressive Party cares about poverty more than 59 percent of the way in economic freedom.
And the Conservatives care more than 28 percent about economic freedom than poverty.
It's incompatible, isn't it?
You're never going to be able to reconcile. You're wrong.
That diversity is what makes it rich.
Remember what broke poverty.
The plan for economic freedom and the obsession with poverty spread around the world.
In other words, we need each other, and if we want to save the next two billion people from poverty, we need to save the next two billion people.
There is no other way.
Hmm.
How do we do that?
It's not tricky.
We need innovative thinking.
There's a lot of these things.
Social entrepreneur. Yes. Sure. It's phenomenal.
We need foreign investment in a sustainable, responsible, ethical and moral way.
Do you know what the most important thing is?
We need flexible thinking.
We need to be less predictable.
Isn't that right?
Don't you think our ideas have been predictable from time to time?
It's a clicus.
Don’t you feel like you’re always listening to people who are sympathetic to you?
Why is that dangerous?
We talk about the economy in this country, and conservatively we talk about taxes and regulation and government.
And on the progressive side, we're talking about the income imbalance in the economy.
That's important. It's important to me and to you.
But if you think about people who are hungry, it's just a hindrance.
We need to find the best way to do that, to break up poverty in the best way, to understand the Conservative Party needs progress, the Progressive Party needs the Conservative Party, it needs the Progressive Party, it needs the Conservative Party, it's understanding the obsession with the free market.
That's the diversity that will make this country stronger in the future, if we realize it.
How do we do it? How do we do it together?
There's a code of conduct for you and me.
Number one: First action: Remember, it's not enough to be patient with the person who opposes.
And that's not the only thing.
We need to know that we need people who disagree with us, because they need our solutions.
What are you going to do? How are you going to do that?
Where do we start? That's it.
We are all blessed here.
There is someone who listens to us.
We have been blessed with prosperity and we have been blessed with leadership.
When people hear our stories about unpredictable ideas, they probably listen.
From there, progress begins.
That's the first one.
Number two: I ask you and yourself, can you be the kind of person who can break down the boundaries of difference?
If you're a conservative, you're a hero of the poor, a conservative who always talks about poverty and moral obligation.
And if you're a liberal, you're a liberal who debates to solve problems with the merits of the free market.
If so, we have two benefits.
Number one: we're going to solve the next two billion people, and we're going to see solutions from the past in the future.
Second, we can turn the conflict of ideas that this country is experiencing into a competition of ideas through mutual respect.
And maybe you'll also find that the difference isn't that big.
Thank you.
When I was in college, I majored in political science, so I had a lot of assignments to write about.
The average student will be distributed this way when they're doing their homework.
You know, it starts a little bit slower at first, but if you do it in the first week, you do it in larger quantities later, and everything ends organizationally.
I want to do that too.
That's how you plan.
It's all set up, but it's actually going to be like this when the task comes up.
This happened to every assignment.
There was a ninety-page graduation thesis, which I had to invest in for a year.
I knew I couldn’t do what I normally do.
It's too important a task to do that.
So I made a plan and I thought I should do this.
This is how you spend a year.
At first, you start with the trick, and in the middle, you're going to speed up a little bit, and at the end, you're going to be a little bit more energetic, like a little staircase, like a little staircase, a month
How hard is it to climb stairs?
There's nothing wrong with that, right?
But then something really funny happened.
The first few months
Time passed and I didn’t do much.
So I made a wonderful revision of the plan.
And then the middle month just passed, and there was nothing written, and so it happened.
Two months is a month, and that's two weeks.
And then one day, when I woke up, I didn't write a single word, even though I had only three days left, so I did what I could. I spent seventy-two hours on the 90th, not for a day, but for two nights, if you're a human, you can't do that, and you can't do that, and you can't do that, and you're running across the campus, you're diving in slow motion, and you barely got to the deadline.
I thought I was done with it.
I got a call from school a week later.
"Is it Tim Urban?" he asked.
And I said, "Yes."
"I need to talk to you about the paper," he said.
And I said, "Do it."
It's like, "This is the best paper I've ever seen."
That didn't happen.
It was a very, very lousy paper.
I just wanted to enjoy a moment when you think like, "This guy's great!"
No, no, it was terrible.
I am currently a blogging writer.
I run a blog called "Wait a minute, but why".
A few years ago, I was going to write about procrastination.
My behavior has always puzzled people who don't put off what to do, and I wanted to explain to them what's going on in the head of the person who's procrastinating what to do, and why we're procrastinating.
I had a hypothesis that people's brains that put off work are different from other people's brains.
To verify this, I went to the MRI lab, scanned both brains, and I also scanned the brains of untested non-procrasted people, and I compared the two.
I'm going to show you today.
Please see if you see any differences.
You don't see the difference unless you're a trained brain expert, but take a look.
This is the brain of a person who doesn't procrastinate.
Now...
This is my brain.
There's a difference.
Both have "reasonable decision-makers," but there's also "momentary-satisfaction monkeys" in the brains of procrastination.
What does this mean for someone who puts off work?
It means everything is fine until this happens.
[No!] The rational decision-maker will make rational decisions to do something productive, but the monkey doesn't like it, so he grabs the steering wheel and says, "Let's read all the Wikipedia pages of the scandal, because the scandal just came to mind, and then let's go to the fridge and see if there's anything new than ten minutes ago.
And then we go to YouTube, and we start with a video of Richard Feynman describing a magnet, and after a while, we're going to watch a video of him interviewing Justin Bieber for the last time.
It all takes a lot of time, so I don’t have time to do anything today.
I'm sorry!"
What's going on?
A momentary-satisfied monkey is not a kid who wants to get behind the wheel.
He lives only in the present moment.
There are no memories of the past or knowledge of the future, and only care about two things: easy and fun.
In the animal world, it's okay.
If you're a puppy and you spend your entire life doing something easy and fun, you've had a successful life!
To this monkey, humans are just animals of another species.
All you have to do is sleep well, eat well, and reproduce well, and that's what it's like in tribal times.
I don't know, but it's not a shortage anymore.
Now it's the age of advanced civilization, and monkeys don't know what it is.
That's why there's another thing in our brain that's called a rational decision-maker, which gives us the ability to do things that animals can't do.
You can dream of the future,
You can see the big picture,
You can also make a long-term plan.
The rational decision-maker tries to consider all of this.
Now, we want to make sure that we do a reasonable job, and sometimes it's easy and fun to do things that are easy and fun to do.
There are times when it's appropriate, when you're having dinner, when you're sleeping, or having a good leisure time, so there's a overlap.
Sometimes they are in each other’s opinions.
But sometimes it's not hard, it's not very pleasant, but it's often much more sensible to do things, for the greater meaning.
That's when there's conflict.
For those who put off work, those conflicts always end in the same way, and they spend a lot of time in this orange zone, an easy and fun kingdom outside of the rational kingdom.
I call it the "Dark Playground."
The Dark Playground is a place that everyone who puts things off to do knows.
It's a place where leisure activities take place, and sometimes you shouldn't do leisure activities.
The fun in the Dark Playground isn't really fun, because you don't deserve to play, and the air there is full of guilt, fear, anxiety, self-blame, and it's all about the emotions of people who put off work.
The question is, in a situation like this, how do the procrastination get to the blue zone where the procrastinating is going to be less fun, where something important happens?
Fortunately, there's a guardian angel who puts things off, who always looks down on him and protects him in the most bleak moments, and that's what he's called a panic monster.
Panic monsters are dormant most of the time, but they suddenly wake up when the deadline is approaching, publicly embarrassing, disaster in their careers, or in danger of a fearsome back-and-forth.
The important thing is that it is the only thing that the monkey is afraid of.
Until recently, I was very close to my life. Six months before TED, I got in touch and invited me to talk.
Of course, I said I would.
I've always had a dream to give a TED Talk.
I’m so excited, I think the rational decision-maker had a different idea.
He said, "You know what we've accepted?
Do you know what will happen in the future?
You have to sit down and start right now."
And the monkey said, "I'm fully agree, but now we just open Google Earth, and we're going to zoom in on the southern tip of India to get to know India better, and we're going to scroll up for two and a half hours until we get to the northern tip of India at 200ft above sea level."
That's why I did it that day.
Six months became four months, two months, one month, the TED player announced the speaker.
When I open the website, my face is looking at me.
Then who woke up?
So the panic freak starts to set the line, and after a few seconds, the whole system went crazy.
The monkey, who is afraid of the panic monster, runs away to the tree!
And finally, finally, the rational decision-maker took the lead and worked on the talk.
The Panic Monster explains the actions of real people who put off work, how people like me who can't even write the first sentence of the task for two weeks miraculously find a sense of work ethics and spend the night writing eight pages.
All this situation is explained by three figures, this is the system of the person who puts things off.
It's not very good shape, but it works in the end.
So I wrote about this blog a few years ago.
When I wrote, people's reactions were surprising.
Literally thousands of emails have been sent by various people around the world doing different things.
There were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers, and a huge number of doctoral students.
They all said the same thing, "I have the same problem."
But what surprised me was that the blog's writing was in a light tone, and the email was in contrast to a very serious tone.
These people were very frustrated with what happened to their lives because of their procrastination, what the monkey had done to them.
And I looked at this, and I thought, well, if the system of people who put off work works, why is this?
Why are all these people in a dark place?
As you can see, there were two kinds of procrastination.
In all of the examples I've given you today, there's a deadline, and when that deadline is there,
The consequences of procrastination are limited to a short period of time, because panic monsters are involved.
But the second kind of procrastination occurs when there is no deadline.
If you want to be self-employed in the arts or business, there's no deadline for this, because nothing happens until you step up and start working, and there's a lot of important things that don't have any deadlines other than work.
It's about meeting your family, exercising, taking care of your health, maintaining good relationships, organizing relationships, and getting people out of work, and if the only mechanism that makes you do these difficult things is the panic freak, because there's no deadline for all of this, so there's no panicking monster, and there's no chance of waking up.
So the consequences of procrastination are not limited, they just go on forever.
It's ridiculous, it's short-term, it's a long-term procrastination, it's far less visible and undiscussed, and it's usually quietly and alone.
This can be a source of considerable long-term unhappiness and remorse, which is why I think people sent emails.
That's why they're in a very bad situation, not because they're cramming assignments.
Long-term procrastination is like yourself
It's because sometimes you feel like you're a spectator in your life, and it's not because you can't achieve your dreams.
I couldn't even start with a dream, so I read these emails and I got a little bit of an epiphany, and I don't think there's anyone who doesn't put off.
That's right, you're all procrastinators.
Well, you may not be as messed up as we are, and you may have a sound companionship with deadlines, but remember, the monkey's subtle trick comes when there's no deadline.
I want to show you one last thing.
I call it the life calendar.
There is a box every week in the life of ninety years.
We don't have a lot of boxes, especially since we've already used them a lot.
I think you need to look at this calendar carefully for a long time.
We have to think about what we're putting off, because everyone is putting something off in life.
You should always be aware of the momentary satisfaction monkey.
That's what we all have to do.
There aren't many boxes left in the calendar, so you'll probably have to start today.
Well, not today.
Well,
Someday soon.
Thank you.
That day we gathered in the Texas church, the souls and bodies were spending the last days of our lives.
It's like this room in here, but on the squeaky wooden chair, an old red cloth, the organ on my left, and the choir behind me, and a baptismal bath was on the wall behind the choir.
But it was similar here.
Just like here, there was tension, the hope of salvation was full, the sweat was on his hands, and the people sitting in the back were not paying attention.
This was the night of the Second Coming of Jesus on December 31st and I knew it was the end of the world.
I turned twelve years old and felt responsible.
And as soon as I got old enough to take responsibility for what I did, I thought it would be better to stop complaining that it was unfair for Jesus to come back and clean up very quickly.
I went to church as often as possible.
I listened to the stillness as hard as people listened to the sound, to make sure that God wasn't taking me first, and I decided to go home early.
Even though Jesus came back, I prepared an alternative by reading the "leftovers" that were fashionable at the time.
The book says that if I don't get into the ecstasy of the second coming at midnight, I have a chance.
To do this, I had to avoid receiving the mark of the beast and fight the devil, the plague, and the antichrist.
It was hard, but I believed I could do it.
But the time for planning is over.
The clock ticked at eleven-fifty.
We had ten minutes until the second coming, and the pastor called us to come out of our chairs to the foundation, because he wanted to pray when midnight came.
So all the believers gathered together and took their seats.
The choir remained in the choir, and the clergy and his wives, to call me what I wanted to call them, the Baptist bourgeoisie sat at the front of the foundation.
In the United States, there are also VIP seats on the day of the Second Coming of Jesus.
And right behind the Baptist bourgeoisie, the elders, were the elders, who, on a cotton plantation in eastern Texas, made their waists bend when they were young, burning their wrinkle-free, noble brown skin like mud in East Texas, and the dreams and hopes of what life would be like outside of East Texas are sometimes more baked and broken than their crooked waists.
These guys were the main characters of the day for me.
They've been waiting their whole lives for this moment, just as my medieval ancestors had hoped for the end of the world, and just as my grandmother waited for the Oprah Winfrey show to do on the channel eight times a day at four o'clock every day.
When she went to the Foundation, I was closely behind her, and I believed that she was going to heaven, and if she held her hand in prayer, she would be able to hold her hand.
I thought I could go with me, so I held my hand and closed my eyes to listen and wait.
Prayers are greater and prayers are answered.
It was getting louder and louder.
The organ was adding a song here.
I sweat more in the heat.
I clenched my hands and tried to stay away from him alone.
I closed my eyes more tightly and tried not to watch people fall apart.
And a voice rang out over us in prayer: "Amen."
It's over.
I looked at the clock.
It was already midnight.
I looked at the elders, and their saviours didn't come, and they didn't show their disappointment, but they've believed too much and too long, and now they're starting to doubt.
I was angry at them in their situation.
They've been fooled, they've been blindfolded, they've been snubed, they've been smothered, and I've been with them right next to them.
I prayed for them and tried not to fall into temptation.
I soaked my head in that runny baptizing, not once, but twice.
I believed ferociously.
What should I do now?
And when I got home and I turned on the TV, I saw Peter Genings declaring the new Millennium as I was going around the world.
The sudden thought here was that it was strange for Jesus to return to the world in time.
This made me even more ridiculous and really heartbroken.
But that day, I didn't lose faith there.
I'm just starting to believe in new things that it's possible not to believe.
Maybe the answer I have is wrong, and the problem itself is wrong.
And once, as great as a mountain, a great conviction has flowed down to the source, a spring of doubt, the spring that promised the river.
I go back my whole life and vividly remember the night in the church that my Savior didn't appear, the day I learned that what I believed most was that it wasn't a lie, but it wasn't the truth.
Most of you may have welcomed Y2K in a different way, but I'm sure you're here to see my talk because some of you have experienced the same thing as me, since the beginning of the new year, when my mother left and my father walked away, and after the Savior didn't appear.
I held my hand and found a place to lean on my heart.
I entered Yale at the age of eighteen, by the faith that I had raised in Oak Cliffs Texas, and it was an opportunity to leave behind so many of the tests I went through and the breakdown of my body and mind.
But when I came home from a winter vacation, what I found was a gun of robbers with my face on the floor, my back tied behind my back, and a gun of robbers pointed at my head.
I had faith in Lehman Brothers, who worked as an intern in 2008.
I was filled with hope, and I called my family and told them that we wouldn't be poor anymore.
But after I witnessed this temple of finance crumbling before my eyes, I realized that I couldn't be saved even in the best of jobs.
I grew up working as a young employee in Washington, D.C., and I had faith because I heard voices in Illinois saying, "It's been very hard to get here, but this election is going to change America."
But when the National Assembly failed to function and the whole country was destroyed, I realized that hope and change felt like a cruel joke, and that the second coming of a political savior would not save me.
I knelt before the altar of the American Dream and prayed to the god of this age, the god of success money and power.
But I kept my eyes open in the middle of the night and saw that all these gods were dead.
In the midst of despair, I started looking again, not because I was brave, but because I knew I was at a crossroads, believing or dying.
So I went on a pilgrimage to another place at Harvard Business School, and this time I knew I couldn't accept the salvation that I claimed to be true.
But I knew I had more work to do.
It started with a question I had with three friends and I had in the dark corner of a crowded party, a question that young people looking for the truth had been asking for a long time, "Why don't we take a car and go on a trip?"
We didn't know where to go, but we had to go.
Because we've all been looking forward to a life like Jack Kerouac's novel, "Suck out at night and disappearing somewhere," and we've been trying to figure out how people live across the country.
So others said the risk was too great and the evidence was too small, but anyway, we left.
In the summer of 2013, they traveled eight thousand miles across the United States, past a grazing in Montana, through a wilderness in Detroit, across the swamps of New Orleans, working with people there, and working with people there, and they were people who were working on the basics of life through small businesses.
And I was struck by this innovative look at Western capitalism.
And this idea grew and developed into a nonprofit, MBAs Across America, a movement that got me standing here today.
This movement has spread because our generation craves purpose and meaning.
The movement has spread because many entrepreneurs are creating jobs and changing lives all over the United States, and needing a little bit of help.
But to be honest, this movement has spread because I've been fighting.
I've tried to go everywhere to preach this gospel, to make more people believe that we can sew this broken country into one social enterprise.
But the journey to spread this gospel has brought me to another gospel, which is the gospel that I want to share with you today.
About a year ago, one evening at the Natural History Museum in New York, there was an alumni event at Harvard Business School.
There was a model of a real-sized whale, and I was sitting down with the big guys of our time, and they were celebrating their achievements with their peers.
The position was full of pride, because the net worth and wealth that were operated under management exceeded five hundred billion dollars.
It was great to see what we have achieved together.
But there was another two days later, and I went to Harlem to preach the gospel, and I was sitting there on a city farm that was once a vacant lot, and I heard a guy named Tony talk to me about the kids that came out there every day.
All of these children were living extremes.
I carried everything that a lot of kids had in their bags so I wouldn't lose them in a homeless shelter.
Some of them participate in Tony's 'Harlem Grown' to solve the only meal of the day.
Tony said he started shelling out Harlem Grown's pension for twenty years of taxi driving.
He said the reason he took out his pension was because the program was successful but needed sponsorship.
He said he was willing to receive any help.
And I helped with that.
But as I parted ways with Tony, I felt my eyes tingling and tears coming to my eyes.
I felt the weight of the revelation, that one day I was with hundreds of people in one room with five hundred billion dollars, and two days later, I was watching someone give up their pensions in another room, and I was watching them feed.
It's not that we shed tears because of the obvious inequalities, it's not that we shed tears at the thought of hungry children floating on the road, not anger against the top 1 percent or sympathy for the other 99 percent.
I was heartbroken because I realized that I was just a dialysis machine in this country that needed a kidney transplant.
I realized that I was replacing people who didn't have boots, and I was replacing people who were encouraged to wear laces of boots, and I felt that the organization I was running was replacing the structural systemic help that didn't reach Harlem, that in Apalach, in New Orleans, and that my voice was replacing the voices of people who couldn't learn, who couldn't wash, who didn't have a place to live.
And then the shame came, and I felt the same shame that Peter Gennings felt when he sat in front of the TV and cried out for the new Millennium again and again.
I was blinded and confused.
But this false savior was me.
You see, I've come a long way from that altar that night when I thought the world was going to end, in a world where people were saying that suffering is the necessary act of God, that what is written in the Bible is absolutely true.
Yes, I went back a long way and I went back to where I started.
It's simply because we can't say we're living in a time of distrust, and today we have as many people as countless people before us.
Some of us believe the prophecies of Brennet Brown or Tony Robbins.
Some of us believe in the New Yorker or Harvard Business Review as the Bible.
We can believe the most deeply when we gather here at TED Church to worship, but we desperately believe and we must believe.
We, like charismatic leaders, are promising to solve all our problems.
Suffering is seen as the necessary evil of capitalism that we believe in, and we accept that the development of technology is an irrefutable truth.
And we hardly realize the human cost of having these little questions, because we're afraid that it's going to shake up our entire infrastructure.
But if you're heartbroken by the absurd things we've come to accept, it's time to question.
I'm not talking about the gospel of collapse or reform or new corporate performance-measurement principles.
I'm not actually here today to preach the gospel of faith to you.
I have come to preach the gospel of doubt.
The Gospel of Doubt is not telling you not to believe, but rather to believe in new things, that it is possible not to believe.
The answers we have may be wrong, and those who believe in them may be wrong.
Yes, the gospel of doubt is that all of us here can be wrong.
Because this gospel raises the question, "Why?"
The question we asked with all our hearts together was, why should people still suffer like this?
This suspicion led to the closure of my organization, MBAs Across America.
We're going to let our employees go, we're shutting down, we're going to share our business model for free, so that anyone who has the ability to do this can do it without our permission.
This doubt led some people to give up on the role of savior entrusted to me, because our lives are too short and unlikely to await the return of the Savior in the absence of miracles in this world.
And this doubt will give me strength and hope, that when we are worried, when the path before us seems to lead us to the end, when our healers can no longer heal our wounds, not our blind faith, but our humble doubt, become a little light in our lives and in the darkness that is unfolding in this world, and we can raise our voices to whisper,
I'm going to scream, or I'm going to make you say, "" There's going to be another way.
Thank you.
Food shortage
It's in the news every day.
What's the problem?
There are places in the world where there is a shortage of food, while there are too many places.
Where GMOs are saving the world.
Maybe GMOs are a problem?
Excessive agro-waste pollutes the oceans, reducing soil nutrients and reducing them.
The vicious cycle continues.
And when you look at something like this, it's very powerful.
How can you feel this happening on your skin?
How is this apple food?
You've probably had an apple recently.
How long do you think it will be before you apologize?
Two weeks?
Two months?
11months. This is the average age of apples sold in marts in the United States.
The situation is not going to be much different in any part of the world, and then we put chemicals in it, and there are real examples of people losing their lives, because the chemicals used in the process of slowing down the degenerate of apples are harmful to the human body, and how does no one know about it?
Why didn't I know?
When we eat this apple, we lose about 90 percent of our nutrients, including antioxidant enzymes.
This apple is just a lump of sugar.
How can we be information-deficit? How can we do better?
What we lack is a platform.
Platforms and computers connected me to the Internet when I was a child.
I did a lot of weird things on this platform, so I was able to meet people and express myself.
How do you express yourself in food?
If we had a platform, we could ask autonomously.
I asked this question: What if the climate was equal?
This is a map of the world's climate.
The most productive areas are green and the opposite is red.
The climate is changing. California farmers have now turned into Mexican farmers.
China is buying land in Brazil to grow quality food, and we rely heavily on the climate.
What if every country could have the best climate?
How will it change our lives?
How will it affect the quality of life and the quality of food?
The food shortages of previous generations were cheaper and needed more food.
Welcome to International Farm.
We built a large analog farm.
The lines shown above are the transport routes of cars, airplanes, trains, etc.
It's a miracle that very few of society participate in agriculture and feed seven billion people.
But if you...
Building a Digital International Farm?
What if we could digitize this apple with some technology, transmit it into the air, and reconfigure it on the other side of the planet?
What if?
The quote I'm going to introduce you to inspire me in what I'm doing.
First: ["Japan's agriculture has no water, no land, no young blood, no future."] This is the uncomfortable truth I saw following my arrival in Minamisanriku, south of Fukushima, after the catastrophe.
The young people went to Sendai and Tokyo, where the land was contaminated and about 70% of the food was made from foreign countries.
However, this phenomenon is not limited to Japan.
Only 2% of the United States participates in agriculture.
How can 2% of the population be able to do this?
50% of the population in Africa is under the age of 18.
80% don't want to be farmers.
Farming is hard.
The lives of small farmers are miserable.
Young people are moving into the city.
In India, members of farmers are not guaranteed the least amount of infrastructure, and in the last decade, the suicide rate of farmers is higher than ever.
It is an inconvenient truth to put in your mouth.
Where are people headed?
It's a city.
There are no young farmers.
How does this platform move young people?
It's a new tractor.
It's my harvest.
A few years ago I stopped at Bed Bath and Beyond and Home Depot to start making things.
I made silly things, I made plants dance, I connected them to my computer, and I killed them all, and I killed them all.
And then I had the most intimate relationship in my life with plants, because I was getting their language.
I wanted to make it bigger.
"There's an old electronics room here that no one wants.
“Use it well,” I replied.
I built a farm in it with my team, where it had little to do with biology, within 18.3 sqm of this one.
It's not that much, but we've produced a single meal for three hundred people every month, and it's equipped with some interesting technologies.
The most interesting part?
A beautiful, white root, dark green leaf and a month's harvest cycle
Is this a new restaurant?
A new retail experience?
A new supermarket?
One thing can be said: Media Lab people have eradicated something for the first time.
I just ate the salad in the bag, so it's not that strange.
If you're rooting out with video-based processing experts and data scientists and roboticists, you're thinking, "Well, maybe I can contribute to this.
No, I want to try it." And we took some of the plants back to the lab, because what you raised was so valuable that we couldn't throw them away.
I had a delicate palate, because I wanted my plants to be delicious, and I wanted my plants to be delicious.
This is because we eat lettuce before everyone else every day, and now we can adjust the pH of the lettuce within the range of 0.1.
"This is a pH of 6.1. I can't eat it today."
This lettuce was very sweet.
Because this plant was stressed and caused a chemical reaction to protect itself: "I'm not going to die!"
The resistance of plants to live feels sweet to me.
Instead of relying on the latest technology, we went back to plant physiology.
We thought other people should be able to try this.
I want to see an infinite amount of imagination, so I came up with a lab that could ship anywhere and put it into practice.
The front of this media lab is my lab, and it uses thirty sensors per plant.
If you know the genome or the genetics, isn't this the peon?
One phenomenon
If you're saying, "I like Mexican strawberries," it's a more accurate argument that strawberries grown in that climate are good.
If you can code for the climate, this much CO2, O2, is the right prescription, it's going to be coding the nutrition, the climate, the size and the shape and the color and the texture of the plants you're growing.
We need data to analyze what's going on, and that's why we've attached a large number of sensors.
Look at your plants. "Why are you dying? Why can't you talk?"
The farmer will have the eyes of the most beautiful prophet.
When they're in their 60s and 70s, they see a plant that's either nitrogen deprivation or calcium deficiency.
You can see if you need more humidity.
That wisdom is not being followed.
This is the new eye of the cloud environment.
We look for trends in data gathered over time and look for associations with individual plants.
These figures are the IP addresses of all the broccoli that were provided on the day of the buffet.
Now is the time for broccoli to have IP addresses.
If you are ready to be more surprised, you can click on it to see the profile of the plant.
It shows the growth of that plant, but it's not just about showing when it's ripe.
Whether I have achieved the nutritional conditions I want
When do you get the taste you want?
Too much water is being given.
Too much sunlight.
It's alarming about all of this, where plants are talking to me.
Our own language has arisen.
Maybe he's the first user of Facebook? That plant is going to start making friends.
I'm serious. That plant needs less nitrogen and potassium, but it's going to be friends with plants that require more phosphorus.
Now you're going to learn about complex associations that we can only guess, and the results will be different depending on how we do it.
This is the current state of my laboratory.
Now I've got a little bit of a system in place, and I know a little bit about the controlled environment because of my experience designing medical data centers.
So we're doing different experiments in this environment.
This spray light process was also developed by NASA to reduce the water it sends to the Mir space station.
This process allows plants to deliver what they want in the right place. Water, mineral resources and oxygen.
The roots aren't that picky, and if you just fill them in, you get a beautiful response.
It's like having two hearts.
That's why it grows four or five times faster.
It's a perfect environment.
We've been developing seeds to overcome disadvantageous environments for a long time, and that effort will continue, but we've also created a new weapon called a faultless environment, a plant that we've been trying to do.
It's a tomato that hasn't been grown commercially in a hundred and fifty years.
Do you know the seed banks that store all kinds of seeds?
Seed Bank
It's a great place.
There are a lot of different germs preserved, and there's a lot of things that you've never eaten.
I'm probably the only person in the room who's ever eaten tomatoes like that.
The problem is that this tomato is for sauce, and we can't cook it, and we're going to eat it raw as a suboptimal solution, and it's just that.
We've also grown a lot of things through protein modification.
I grew up with people, and of course I didn't.
And what we realized during the experiment was that it's too big and too expensive.
It cost about a hundred thousand dollars per unit to be installed in different parts of the world.
There's not a lot of people who can spend a hundred thousand dollars at any time, so I wanted to make it smaller.
In fact, this project is from my undergraduate student Camille, who is majoring in mechanical engineering, so Camille and my team spent the entire summer thinking about how to make cheaper, more performance products easier.
And we installed this machine in the 7-11th grade class of several schools.
Teach your children to feel humble.
I once asked the students, "Make your humidity 65 percent."
And I was a seventh-grade student, and I said, "What's your humidity?"
“Ethrow is water in the air.”
"There's water in the air, asshole."
So I advised, "Yeah, don't believe me."
What else do you believe in me?
Set the humidity to a hundred.
What happened when the child changed the settings?
The gas condenses, the water vapor is frosted, and the droplets drop at the end.
And she says, "Oh! The humidity is raining."
"Why didn't you tell me that?"
The interface we created is similar to an online game.
Users can access the 3D environment from anywhere in the world. It can be done on smartphones and tablets.
The user adjusts the physical environment and sensors of this machine garden.
You can choose the cultivation method made by different children all over the world.
And activate its cultivation method and plant the seeds.
The seeds can also make changes during the growing season.
"Why do you need carbon dioxide, killing people, isn't it bad for your body?"
They can increase their carbon dioxide levels and kill plants.
You can also lower the level so that the plants grow well.
After growing the plant, a new digital cultivation method is completed.
This process is a series of development and exploration, and users are able to create what they produce.
You can download digital cultivation and data, you can compare whether it's advanced, it's all just beginning, and we're going to learn a lot.
This is the food computer, and three weeks went by in each school.
It's been growing so far.
But more importantly, I was the first to think about him, "I can be a farmer," or "I want to be a farmer."
We've open sourced all of this.
Everything is on the web, so make it on time.
It's not going to be easy.
We're just getting started.
It’s so much easier for everyone to get involved because it’s very important to me.
It will make it easier.
It's farmers. Electronics Engineer, Mechanical Engineer, Environmental Engineer, Computer Scientist Plant Scientist, Economist, City Architect
They do what they are good at on one platform.
And then the body got too big.
This is the facility I just started.
It can be installed anywhere in the world.
That’s why I chose this method.
In this warehouse, we're going to build something like this.
These things already exist.
These already exist.
The first plant
The second facility will cultivate the Ebola vaccine.
The winners of the Darpa Grand Challenge and the plants you just saw are one of the reasons humans are ahead of the Ebola virus.
These plants produce proteins that are resistant to Ebola.
Pharmaceuticals, medicinal foods and lettuce
These two seem to be completely different in my field.
Everything is different.
This is a field of complacency, and it's a little bit of a mess, and they boast about each other's products, and they're like, "My stuff includes very expensive intellectual property.
And not my own.”
But the reality is we're just getting started.
It's also a time when society is changing rapidly, and in the past, if it was cheap, it was a lot of food.
Now we need quality eco-friendly food, and it's not strange to be ranked as the number one mystery food in the world.
We're in an era of advertising about what McDonald's chicken mac nuggets are made of, and everything is changing.
In the future
Personal Food Computer Food Server and Food Data Center
Like Wikipedia, who's going to add climate-specific cultivation methods and how does it come to be implemented in society?
Remember this chart I showed you earlier?
In the future, there will be a point instead of a line.
Not to ship the food itself.
I'm going to send food information, and this is not my imagination.
It's already the direction that humanity is headed, food computers, servers, and it's going to be a
The upcoming Food Data Center will connect people with the mistakes of the current system.
Blaming each other is not the future of food.
We already know what is wrong.
The future of food supply is to connect the next generation of farmers to platforms, empowering them and asking each other questions, "What if?"
Thank you.
Sometimes I feel really ashamed as a European.
In the past year, millions of people in need of our help have arrived in Europe, and our response has been frankly pathetic.
There are so many contradictions.
We mourned the tragic death of two-year-old Alan Cuddy, but even then more than two hundred children continued to drown in the Mediterranean.
We have an international treaty that recognises refugees as a shared responsibility, and yet we have accepted that small Lebanons, more Syrians, than all European countries.
We mourn the existence of human smugglers, but we're making it the only way to asylum in Europe.
We're going through a labor shortage, but we're blocking people who are in need of the economy and the population from coming to Europe.
We are asserting the value of freedom against Islamic fundamentalism, but we have a coercive policy: detaining children seeking asylum, leaving children separated from their families, and confiscation of the property of refugees.
What are we doing?
How did things get so far? Why are we so inhumanely confronting the humanitarian crisis?
I don't think people are interested, or at least I don't want to believe that.
I think it's because our politicians don't have a vision. We don't have a vision for how to change the international refugee system that was created more than fifty years ago and apply it to an internationalized world.
So what I want to do is take a step back and ask two very fundamental questions, questions that we all need to answer.
Why is the current system not working?
Second, what do we need to do to fix this system?
The modern refugee system was created in the aftermath of the Second World War, by these people.
Its basic goal is to ensure that when the state fails, or in severe cases, when it turns its back on its own people, it guarantees people where they go and live in safety and dignity until they can go home.
It was built for the same situation as Syria today.
Through an international agreement signed by 147 governments, the 1951 Agreement on Refugee Status and the United Nations Refugee Agency, an international body, agreed to mutually accept people who had been exiled from physical conflicts and abuses on their territory.
Today, the system has failed.
In theory, refugees have the right to seek asylum.
Indeed, our immigration policies are blocking the road to safety.
In theory, refugees have the right to be accepted or returned to their country.
But in reality, they are stuck in an uncertain situation with no end in sight.
In theory, refugees are the world's common responsibility.
In fact, if you look at the demographics, countries that are close to conflict zones are overwhelmingly accepting the vast majority of the world's refugees.
This system is not broken because the rules are wrong.
Because we haven't applied it properly to a changing world, and that's what we need to rethink.
So I'm going to give you a quick look at how the current system works.
How does the refugee system actually work?
I will tell you from the point of view of refugees, not from the institutional point of view of the above.
Let's think of a Syrian woman.
I'll call her Amira.
For me, Amira symbolizes a lot of people I met in the area.
Amira is a woman with children, like about 25 percent of the world's refugees, and she can't go home, because she's from this city, and Holmes, which was a beautiful and historic city on the screen, is now covered in a pile of stones.
I can't go back to Amira.
But Amira can't even have a wish to resettle to a third country, because it's a lotto lottery ticket that's only allowed for less than 1% of the world's refugees.
So Amira and her family face an almost impossible choice.
They have three choices.
The first option is to take the family to the camp.
You can get help from the camps, but there is little hope for Amira and her family.
The camps are in a desolate and dry, near-desert region.
At the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan, you can hear shells across the Syrian border in the middle of the night.
Economic activity is also limited,
The quality of education is also low.
And around 80 percent of the refugees who live in camps worldwide have to spend at least five years there.
That's why it's a miserable life, and in fact, only 9% of Syrians choose camps.
Instead, Amira can head to urban areas in neighboring countries such as Aman and Beirut.
This is the method already chosen by 75% of Syrian refugees.
But there is also great difficulty there.
Refugees usually do not have the right to work in such urban areas.
There's no particular way to get help.
So Amira and her family spend all their money and are faced with little or no poverty.
So there's a third alternative, which is the one that a lot of Syrians have been choosing recently.
Amira can put her life on a very dangerous and difficult journey to another country for her family, and this is what we see in Europe today.
The world is being forced into three choices that are almost impossible for refugees: life in camps, urban poverty, and dangerous travel.
For refugees, that choice is a global refugee remedy today.
But I think this is the wrong choice.
I think we need to rethink this choice.
We limit our options because we think they're the only way for refugees to choose, but that's not the case.
Politicians define this as a zero-sum issue, which means that if you benefit refugees, you're going to cost your citizens.
We seem to regard refugees as an inevitable expense, or a burden to society.
But it's not, they can contribute too.
So what I'd like to argue is that there's a way to expand the options for refugees and benefit everyone, for refugee camps and organizations, for our communities and for refugees, for all of our communities.
And what I'd like to suggest is four ways to change the paradigm for treating refugees.
These four ways have one thing in common: they're all taking advantage of globalization and liquidity, market opportunities, and they're shifting our thinking on the refugee issue.
The first thing I want you to think about is the environment, and it starts with the basic perception that refugees are just people in a special environment.
I worked with a colleague in Oxford on a research project to look at the economic lives of refugees in Uganda.
We chose Uganda not because of our host country.
Uganda is exceptional.
What Uganda, unlike most of the world's host countries, has done is provide economic opportunities for refugees.
It gave me the right to work, I gave them freedom of movement.
And the result was enormous for both refugees and society.
In the capital, Kampala, we saw that 21 percent of refugees were doing business with someone else, and 40 percent of the employees were Ugandans.
In other words, refugees were creating jobs for the citizens of the host country.
Even in the camps, we found exceptional cases: vibrant, thriving entrepreneurship businesses.
For example, I saw a Congolese refugee who runs a digital music business in a residence called Nakivale.
One Rwandan refugee also used recycled TVs and game consoles to run a business where children could play computer games.
In the face of extreme constraints, refugees were innovating, and this shrine in front of you was a Congolese man called Democae.
Demokay wanted to be a filmmaker, even though he came to his residence with almost empty hands.
So I started a local radio station with my friends and colleagues, and now I'm making a movie by borrowing a video camera.
He made two documentaries for our team, and he created a successful business with almost nothing.
This is an example that could change our response to refugees.
We need to give them the opportunity to thrive as human beings, not just to rely on humanitarian aid.
Of course, clothes, blankets, shelters, food are all very important factors in an emergency, but we need to look beyond that.
We need to give them opportunities: connectivity, electricity, education, the right to work, capital and finance.
Everything we take for granted in the global economy can and should apply to refugees.
The second thing I want to discuss is the economic zone.
Unfortunately, not all the host countries in the world are taking the same action as Uganda.
Most countries are not opening up their economies to refugees.
But there are still practical alternatives that we can take.
Last April, I visited Jordan with a colleague of mine, Paul Corriller, a development economist, who came up with an idea while I was there, working with the international community and the government, supporting Jordan's national development strategy to provide jobs to Syrians.
The idea is about an economic zone that could potentially integrate refugee employment and employment in Jordan, a host country.
The home of 83,000 refugees, just 15 minutes from the Zaatari refugee camp, is an existing economic zone called the King Hessen bin Taral Development Zone.
The government spent more than $1bn to build an electrical network, a road network, but it lacked two things: labor access and internal investment.
What if the refugees had been able to work there, if they could have supported their families and trained in vocational training rather than being locked up in camps, until they were back in Syria?
That would benefit Jordan, because Jordan's development strategy is calling for a leap forward as a middle-class country through manufacturing.
This can not only benefit refugees, but also contribute to the restoration of post-conflict Syria through the recognition that we need to embrace refugees as the best resource for rebuilding Syria.
We published this idea in the Diplomatic Journal,
King Abdullah adopted our idea.
It was announced at the Syria conference in London two weeks ago and will be piloted this summer.
The third idea I'd suggest to you is to match preferences between countries and refugees to lead to happy outcomes, like the picture of Angela Merkel and Syrian refugees here.
We rarely ask refugees what they want and where they want to go, but I have to ask this and I want to argue that this can benefit everyone.
The economics paper Alvin Ross developed a matching market idea, a way for the party's preferences to eventually match.
My colleagues Will Jones and Alex Titelboim studied whether the idea was applicable to refugees, to rank their preferred destinations for refugees, and to match them in terms of technology and language.
Of course, there's a need for some tolerance for diversity and vulnerability here, but it's still a way to increase the chances of matching.
Matching ideas can be used in many places, for example, to match student and university areas, to match patients with kidney transplanters, and to the algorithm of dating websites.
What if we applied this to the important choice of refugees?
It's also applicable at the national level, of course, to persuade communities to accept refugees, which is the great challenge we face.
And then, for example, in our country, we often send engineers and farmers to rural and urban areas, which is ridiculous.
So market matching is a way to ask for your preferences, and it's a potential way to cater to the needs and needs of refugees as well as host countries.
The fourth ideal I want to tell you about is a humanitarian visa.
The vast majority of the tragedies and disruptions seen in Europe are largely preventable.
This is due to the fundamental contradiction of the European asylum policy, so to get into exile in Europe, so to get on a voluntary basis on the very dangerous journey that I mentioned earlier.
But why do we have to travel like this in this day and age with low-cost aviation and modern consularity?
It's a really unnecessary journey, and more than 3,000 people lost their lives on European borders and on European territory in the past year.
If refugees could travel directly to Europe, if they could find asylum, we could have avoided it, and we could do something with what's called a humanitarian visa, where people would get a visa at an embassy or a consulate in neighboring countries, and they could buy a boat or a ticket to go to Europe.
If you want to go from Turkey to the Greek island through a smuggler, you have to pay 1,000 euros.
From Bodrum to Frankfurt, you can get 200 euros.
Allowing refugees to do so would serve as a clear advantage.
It can save lives, it can limit the market for smugglers, it can eliminate the chaos it sees on European front lines like the Greek islands.
What prevents us from doing so is politics, not rational solutions.
And here's the idea that applied.
Brazil has introduced a pioneering approach, granting humanitarian visas to 2,000 Syrians, allowing them to enter Brazil and granted refugee status.
Thanks to this scheme, all Syrians have gained refugee status and have been recognized as pure refugees.
There is also a historical precedent for this.
Between 1922 and 1942, the Nansen passport was used for travel, and 450,000 Assyrians, Turks and Chechens were allowed to travel to Europe and received refugee status from anywhere in Europe.
The Nansen International Refugee Agency received the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its effective strategy.
So the four ideas I've talked about are ways we can increase Amira's options.
It's a way to give more choices to refugees, a way to benefit everyone, as I've said, over three choices that are so basic, almost impossible.
In conclusion, we really need a new perspective: a vision to increase the choice of refugees, a vision that we don't need to recognize refugees as burdens.
When you look at the cost of refugees, anything is possible.
Of course, they're a humanitarian responsibility, but they're people who have the skills, the talent, the inspiration, the ability to contribute, if we help them do that.
In the new world, migranting is not about leaving forever.
What we have witnessed in Europe will not last long.
People will continue to travel, they're going to find new settlements, and we're going to find a rational, realistic way to do this, not based on the old theory of humanitarian aid, not on the basis of philanthropy, but on the creation of opportunities, on globalization, in the market, in mobility.
I want to call on all of you and politicians to wake up to this challenge.
Thank you very much.
When I was a kid, I used to dream about the ocean.
The ocean was a wild world full of color and life, home to strangely-looking creatures.
I photographed a big shark that ruled the food chain, and I saw elegant sea turtles dancing across the coral reefs.
As a marine biologist and photographer, I spent most of my professional life looking for the fantastic places I dreamed of as a child.
As you can see, I've experienced the water world since I was quite young.
The first time I went to the deep sea, I was only ten years old.
I still vividly remember that I was so fiercely ducking out to reach the old, hard cannon on the coral reef.
Finally, when I held the cannon in my hand, I looked up and realized that it was surrounded by colorful, iridescent fish.
I fell in love with the sea that day.
For forty years living on this planet, I have had the privilege of working for the National Geographic Monthly and Save Hour Sith Foundation to explore some of the most beautiful seascapes.
I've photographed a lot of creatures, from very, very giant sharks to the ensuing sharks that fit in the palm of their hand.
In the cold waters of Canada's Great Bear Rainforest, I smelled the fishy mouths of black-backed whales feeding in front of me.
We've also seen the mating rituals of blue sea turtles in the Mozambique Channel.
Everyone on this planet is affected by the ocean.
And the natural ocean that you dreamed of as a child is becoming more and more difficult to find.
They are under more pressure and threatened.
I have witnessed and photographed the ramifications of our humans on nature as the leading predators on the planet.
For quite some time, I thought I had to show shocking pictures to wake up the audience from indifference.
Although this approach also has its advantages, it has come back to the point of origin.
The best way to drive change is to show love.
Maybe I have a rare opportunity to reveal animals and ecosystems that are hidden under sea level as a kind of matchmakers and photographers.
If you don't even know it exists, you can't love and defend anything.
Revealing the beauty of nature is the power of environmental protection photography.
I have visited hundreds of marine locations, but few have made a deep impact on me.
The first time I fell into such trance was a decade or so ago on the rocky wild shores of South Africa.
Every year in June and July, huge sardines move north to a collective migrant called sardine running.
These fish have a good reason to run away.
They are being chased by a swarm of starved and sleek predators.
They hunt together, and they separate some sardines from the main herd, making them a mass of bait.
The dolphins lure the fish to the sea level while trapping it, and then they plant a feast table that's on the go.
A shark chases behind.
Many people think that sharks and dolphins are enemies of the maimed sky, but these two coexist in sardine runs.
In fact, dolphins help sharks to predator more efficiently.
Without dolphins, the bait mass becomes even more dispersed, and sharks often fill their stomachs with what I call sardine doughnuts, and their mouths are filled with water.
There have been a few dangerous moments with sharks in sardine runs, but sharks don't see me as a prey.
But at this noisy banquet, I'm hit or tailed like any other guest.
From the coast of Africa, we cross the vast Indian Ocean and go east to the Maldives, an archipelago of coral reef islands.
And during the stormy rainy season in the southwest, manta rays from all over the archipelago go to a small place in the Baa atoll called Haniparu.
A herd of a herd that is not larger than the pupils is their main prey.
When the plankton density is reduced, they feed themselves, like dogs chasing their tails, and they continue to flip.
But as the plankton density increases, the manta rays form these long food chains, and the prey that escapes the first or second manta rays is sure to be eaten by the next manta ray.
At the peak of plankton levels in the bay, manta rays swim close by showing the unusual behavior we call swirling feeding.
And as they swim in dense formations, the manta rays create their own vortices, sucking plankton into their mouths.
This experience of swimming surrounded by swarms of manta rays is truly unforgettable.
When I first photographed Haniparu, it was unprotected and threatened by development.
Working with NGOs like the Manta Foundation, my photographs ultimately helped Haniparu turn into a marine reserve.
Fishermen from neighboring islands, who were hunting manta rays to make traditional drums out of their shells,
Now they're the most ardent environmentalists, and the Maldives economy earns more than eight million dollars a year in income from manta rays.
I've always wanted to travel back in time to an era where most maps were mostly empty or where the map was written "There's a dragon."
And the closest I've ever had was in the remote coral islands of the western Indian Ocean.
Diving into the water, away from ocean routes and fishing fleets is a heartbreaking reminder of what our oceans once looked like.
Very few people have heard of Vasas da India, a small coral reef island in the Mozambique Channel.
Corals form an external barrier for protection, and the inner shell is the kennels of Galapagos sharks.
These sharks are never shy, even during the day.
I almost assumed that the sharks would be bolder at night.
I've never seen so many sharks in one coral reef.
Sharing these moments reminds me why I chose this path.
Earlier this year, I went to Bha California as a challenge for National Geographic magazine.
And if you go half way from the Pacific, you'll find the San Ignacio Lagoon, which is an important birthplace for ghost whales.
For a hundred years, this coast has been the site of the Great Regiment. More than 20,000 ghost whales have died and only a few hundred remain.
Today, the descendants of the surviving whales push their young to sea level, playing with us and even interacting with us.
This species has made a truly remarkable comeback.
On the other side of this peninsula is Cabo Pulmo, a scluded fishing village.
Decades of overfishing led to the collapse of the town.
In 1995, local fishermen persuaded officials to designate their coasts as marine shields.
But what has happened since then has been a miracle.
After just a decade of protection, scientists have seen the recovery of the largest fish in history.
But don't believe me, come with me.
Let's swim together into the largest and densest flock of fish I've ever encountered.
We can all be creators of hope.
And I want to teach you the lesson of our photography that there is still hope in our oceans.
In particular, I would like to pay attention to the resilience of nature, which faces seven billion people.
My hope is that it will be very difficult to take pictures like this in the future, but I want to take pictures that show that we and the ocean are respectful and co-existing with each other.
I hope it will be normal to take those pictures.
To survive and thrive as a marine photographer, you have to be a great optimist.
I always work with the belief that the next great photo is near, which is going to be the next big picture that's going to change, and I'm going to be in the next lagoon or next for the coral that's going to be facing.
When I came to Harare, Zimbabwe, the government was at the heart of the national health policy, social justice.
After the long War of Independence, a new government was in place, and the new government immediately adopted a socialist policy: health services and basic education for free.
With the explosion in the number of local health centers, 80 percent of the population is within two hours of the health center.
In 1980, only 25 percent of children were vaccinated.
Ten years later, in 1990, that percentage increased to 80 percent.
I took great pride in being part of this change and revolution.
I felt a strong excitement and camaraderie with people.
Working with some of Zimbabwe's great scientists, doctors and activists, I felt that I was in the field of the African independence movement, and in the field of the experiment of the global welfare movement, but there were also difficult things.
In the first year I arrived,
The first case of AIDS infection has been reported in Zimbabwe.
I've been in a few cases of AIDS in my medical training, but it's hard to expect equal medical resources in Africa.
In the beginning, the infection rate was about 2%, and by the time I left Harare, 17 years after that, I was going to be able to do that.
It soared to one in four.
In the mid-1990s, I sentenced hundreds of people at the peak of their lives to AIDS positive.
I've seen colleagues, friends, students, patients die.
As a response, my colleagues and I opened the clinic.
We taught them how to use condoms.
We also conducted training in schools and workplaces.
They also gave us advice on how our infected people's partners could protect themselves from the disease.
I worked hard and believed that I was doing my best at the time.
As a doctor, I treated patients brilliantly, but I didn't claim that structural changes were necessary.
Former UN chief Kofi Annan has made the mistake of calling the Rwandan genocide.
He was the UN's Director of Peacekeeping Operations.
In his 10th anniversary speech, he said, “I believed I was doing my best at the time, but when I looked back after the massacre, I realized that there were more things I could or should have done, and that I could inform and help in advance.”
Now that AIDS has disrupted the health system and cost the lives of 39 million people estimated by the World Health Organization, I feel sorry for what I didn't do before.
Until I was in Zimbabwe, I didn't see my role as policy support or political participation.
I was there as an expert in medical and epidemiological technology.
My job in mind was to take care of my patients and, through research, to better understand the path of transmission of the disease, to slow the spread of the disease.
I learned that marginalized people in society were exposed to the threat of AIDS.
On sugar farms, which are more closed than any modern business, we found that 60 percent of pregnant women were infected with AIDS.
I've tried to inform you that the fact of HIV infection is due to a masculinity culture, forced migrant labor, and colonization, not a moral depravity.
Whites had a lower rate of infection.
As health professionals, the tools we were given were very poor: lifestyle changes, the use of condoms, the reduction of same-sex companions.
The infection rate continued to rise, and the most likely hope of treatment was developed in the West, but at cost, it was too expensive for me to be able to do so, and I think it's a great deal of trouble.
I didn't speak out about the inequities of access to therapy, the problems of the economic and political system, and I just justified my silence, and I thought that if I warned you, you would be expelled, and that you would no longer be able to care for patients or do the necessary research.
So I complied with the government's initial response to AIDS.
I didn't speak out loud enough about my concerns.
Many doctors and health professionals think it's not my fault.
The Hippocratic Oath, the contract with the patient, means the sacredness of the patient-dohist relationship.
And I gave each of my patients everything I could.
But I knew that disease is at the cracks of our society, not just biology, but social disparity, marginalization, and discrimination of race, gender, class, and so on, have a greater impact.
AIDS did.
The same was true of the recent Ebola outbreak.
Paul Palmer, a medical anthropologist who studied AIDS in Haiti, calls this “structural violence.” The problem with structure is that there are inherent in political and economic structures that we don’t have in our society that vested interests are not aware of, because violence is as traumatic as early death, suffering, and disease.
Without knowing this social injustice, the patient's treatment is only secondary.
It's a warning in advance that it's the first step to public health rights, and it's a way to solve problems and make real change together, so today, I'm not being quiet.
Even if those who listen are uncomfortable,
Even if I'm uncomfortable with myself, I say a lot of things, most of which are either racial polarization or
It's about routine racism, and these are things that shouldn't be in this country anymore, especially in the medical and public health sectors.
But they're squistoes, and we don't care.
That's why it's the job of New York's health commissioner to warn of the impact of racism on health in America, to warn that the daily impact of the organization, the violence by individuals, the two hundred and fifty years of slavery, ninety years of racism, and sixty years of incomplete equality in America, is the death toll before the age of sixty-five.
Blacks are 50 percent higher than whites.
In 2012, black women were more than ten times more likely to die in childbirth than white women.
And even though the infant mortality rate has declined tremendously, black babies are still nearly three times more likely to die in the first year than white babies, New York, no exception.
These statistics are similar to those we've seen across the United States.
Recently, the New York Times reported that one-and-a-half million black men are missing across the country, and then there are those who should be located between the ages of twenty-five and fifty-four.
One in six black men is in prison, or because of early death, young black men face inequality and one-sided violence in their daily lives.
The recent rise in social movements, the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, shows up, but at the same time, we're also seeing their pain and the pain of them.
We need to remember that as a result of numerous risk levels and major diseases, diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and AIDS slowly encroach on their lives and, if severe, lead to early death.
As the #BlackLivesMatter movement unfolded, I was disappointed and outraged that the medical community wasn’t even using the word racism in research or at work.
My feelings will be passed on to you as well.
Medical students often wear back-and-forths and protest, but in general, the medical community is silent about the impact of social discrimination on the spread of disease and mortality.
And I think that when it comes to the personalization, precision medicine that develops treatments biologically or genetically, the fact that this movement is the only way we can do is, because of the side effects that we live in, that the working, loving daily life that we live in has the greatest impact on public health, and that too many people are disadvantaged.
I'm afraid to forget, because as a health professional who works in my daily life, every time I do a medical treatment or a research study, we realize a tremendous injustice, whether it's a homeless person who can't follow a prescription because they're more urgent to maintain their lives than they do, because they're young men and they're taking care of suicide because they can't stand the discrimination in our society, and they're responsible for their own illness.
There were single mothers who felt that our role as health professionals is not only to treat patients, but also to warn them in advance and to call for change.
Rightly or wrongly, our social status empowers us, and we must not waste this power.
Repenting of Zimbabwe's work, I vowed that as the head of the New York Department of Health would be willing to warn me in advance and spare no means of supporting health equality.
I want to help you, and I'm going to help you when you're going to call out sexism or other discrimination, and now we're going to stand up and be able to talk to you about sexism and other things.
It's time for us to speak out on structural inequalities together, and we need to be able to figure out how to change that.
We don't have to deal with all the cases, we just need courage.
The health of our patients, and of all of us, depends on it.
Raise your hand on Facebook for those who have ever blocked someone who said nasty things about politics, religion, parenting, and food.
Or is there at least one person you want to avoid?
In the old days, if you want to have a respectful conversation, you can only say what Henry Higgins said in "My Fair Lady," "talk only about the weather and health."
But these days, because of climate change and the anti-vaccine movement, it's dangerous.
The world we live in has the potential for all conversations to develop into debates, where politicians can't talk to each other, and the smallest of problems is someone passionately arguing, which is abnormal.
We studied ten thousand adult Americans at the Pew Institute, and we found that we are now the most polarized and divided in history.
They're less likely to compromise, and they don't listen to other people.
Where we live, who we marry, and even who we make friends with depend on our beliefs.
I mean, don't listen to other people.
Conversations need to be balanced between speaking and listening, but one day we've lost that balance.
To some extent, it is due to the development of technology.
We always have a smartphone or we can always have it right next to us so we can pick it up.
According to the Pew Institute, one in three American teenagers sends more than a hundred texts every day.
And most teenagers are texting more often than they do talking to their friends.
I wrote a funny article in the Atlantic.
It was written by a high school teacher named Paul Van Well.
Mr. Banwell asked his students on a certain topic.
I asked him to tell me on the spot without having to write it down.
And Mr. Banwell said,
“I realized that the art of conversation is the one that is most underestimated and not taught.”
Children communicate on screen for hours every day, but they don't have much opportunity to brush up on human-to-human conversation skills.
It may be a strange question, but let's ask ourselves. Is there a second skill in the 21st century that is more important than a logical and confident conversation?
I have a job to talk to people about talking to people, a Nobel laureate, a truck driver, a billionaire, a kindergarten teacher, a head of state, a plumber...
I talk to people I like and people I don’t like.
I talk to people I don't personally agree with.
But have a good conversation.
So I'm going to tell you in the next ten minutes and how to listen.
A lot of people have probably heard advice about this, like, look at your eyes and talk about it, think about interesting topics in advance, or show them that you're laughing and paying attention, or telling them what you've just heard, or summarizing it.
Forget all this advice.
It's bullshit.
If you really listen, you don't have to learn to listen.
Even when I have a normal conversation.
I use my skills in doing professional interviews, so I'm going to use the skills to improve your conversation skills.
I'm going to teach you interview techniques that don't waste time, that don't get bored, that don't offend others.
Learn to talk.
We've all had good conversations before, and I know what a good conversation is, it's immersive, it's inspiring, it's inspiring, it's inspiring, it's inspiring, it's inspiring, it'
A conversation that really feels work or is fully understood.
Most of the conversations you're having don't do that, and I'm going to give you ten basic rules, and I'm going to tell you all about all of them, even if you're just one of them, you're going to have to do it.
I can enjoy a much better conversation.
First of all, don't do multiple things at once, your phone, your tablet, your car keys, whatever you have in your hand.
I'm not asking you to just put it down.
Be faithful in the moment.
Focus.
I had an argument with my boss, and I'm on the menu tonight.
Don't think about it. If you want to end a conversation you're having, don't focus vaguely, get out of the conversation.
Second, do not preach.
If you only want to express your opinions, if you don't want to react, argue, rebut, or grow, write a blog.
The reason I don't call commentators on my shows is because I'm boring.
If you're conservative, you're gonna hate Obama, you're gonna hate welfare, you're gonna hate abortion.
If you're a progressive, you're going to hate big banks, oil companies and Dick Cheney.
It's completely obvious.
You shouldn't do this.
Talk to yourself that there is always something to learn.
The famous psychotherapist M. Scott Peck once said that true listening is to let yourself down.
This means that there are times when you need to let go of your personal opinion.
According to him, if the listener feels that the listener is embracing, it becomes weaker and more open-minded.
Again, I always think there is something to learn.
Bill Nye: "Every one you meet knows something you don't know."
In my words, everyone is an expert in some field.
Third, ask questions that are free to answer.
Learn how journalists use it.
Start with the rule of law.
When you ask complex questions, you get a simple answer.
And I said, "Are you scared?"
You're going to respond to the most powerful word in that question: fear, and you're going to say, "Yes," or "No."
"Are you angry?" "Yes, I was very angry."
Let the respondent describe it himself, he knows his feelings.
"How did you feel?" or "How did you feel?"
Ask me.
Then the responder will have to think for a moment and give a more interesting answer.
Fourth, follow the flow of the conversation.
When you have an idea in your head, it means you have to get it out of your head.
In an interview, a guest talks for a few minutes, and then the host suddenly opens up or asks another question that has already been answered.
It means that you're asking a very sharp question to the host, and you're not listening anymore, two minutes before, and you're just waiting for the time to ask that question.
We do the same thing.
I remember sitting and talking to someone, and suddenly I met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop.
Then we stop listening.
Something topic or thought will come to mind.
But you have to let it go.
Fifth, if you don’t know.
These days, radio, especially those on public television, beware of saying, "I know for certain because I'm an expert in this field," because they know that what they're saying is recorded.
Be careful too.
The conversation should not be frigid.
Sixth, do not equate your experience with the experience of others.
When someone talks about the death of a family, don’t talk about when you lost a family member.
If someone says that your company is hard, don’t complain about your work.
It's never the same.
Every experience is different.
First of all, you are not the center.
You don't have to use that moment to brag or poo-mot.
Someone asked Stephen Hawking what his IQ was and he said, "I don't know. He who boasts IQ is a scoundite."
Conversation is not a chance to be proud of yourself.
Seventh, don't say what you said, it's like you're being squeamish, and it's really boring, but we do it often.
Especially when you're at work or talking to your child, if you have a point that you want to say, you're going to repeat the same thing.
Don't do that.
Eighth, don't be obsessed with detailed information.
I honestly don't care about the exact year or the name or the date you're trying to remember, I'm interested in you.
They care about who you are and what you have in common.
So forget the details, you don't have to say it.
Not the last one, but the most important.
Listen to me.
A lot of great people have said that listening is perhaps the most important skill you can develop, and the Buddha said, "If you have an open mouth, you're not learning."
Calvin Coolidge said, “No one has been fired.”
Why don't we listen?
First, because we want to talk.
When I speak, I control the conversation.
You don't have to listen to what I don't care about.
I got my attention.
I can strengthen my identity.
But there's another reason: we take our attention.
People say an average of 225 words per minute, but you can hear up to 500 words per minute.
That's why I'm filling the other two hundred and fifty-five words in my head.
I know, it takes a lot of effort and energy to focus on other people, but if you don't focus, you're not talking.
It's just that two people are throwing unrelated sentences in the same space-time.
We have to listen to each other.
Steven Kirby said,
"We do not listen to understand, we listen to answer."
Finally, be brief.
'A good conversation is a miniskirt. It's short enough to keep you interested and long enough to cover a topic.' - My brother, after all, the basic principle of all of this is one thing: be interested in others.
I grew up with a famous grandfather, and there was a kind of consciousness in the house.
When someone came to talk to my grandparents, she asked me if I knew who he was.
“He’s a Miss America line.
He's the mayor of Sacramento.
He's a Pulitzer Prize winner, and he's a Russian ballerina."
So I grew up thinking that everyone has something amazing that's hidden.
I think I became a good host because of that.
Keep your mouth open as much as possible, always be prepared to be surprised, and never be disappointed.
Do the same.
Go out and talk to people, listen to them, and be prepared to be surprised.
Thank you.
Hello.
My name is Matthew Williams, and I'm a champion.
I won several medals in three sports at the national competition in Canada, competed in international basketball competitions, and was proud to represent Canada on the global stage.
I do five days of basketball and speedskating training every week, and I try to be the best of my sport with the best coaches and psychiatrists.
All of this is possible through special Olympics.
Have you changed your mind about me and my accomplishments?
The world doesn't see all of us as champions.
Not long ago, people like me were the object of escape and had to be hidden.
Since the start of the Special Olympics in 1968, there have been many changes, but in most cases, the intellectually disabled are invisible to many people.
I think people use the word "ᄇ" in front of me and I don't care.
The word is used to mean "stupid" or "stupid" in a way that insults and demeans people.
They don't think about how much of a hurt these words hurt me and my friends.
I don't want you to think I'm here for charitable purposes.
I'm here because there's still a big problem with a lot of people's view of the intellectually disabled, or in too many cases, and they don't even recognize them.
Did you know there was a World Cup this year?
I was one of more than 6,500 intellectually disabled athletes from 165 countries who came to participate in the Special Olympics in Los Angeles.
More than 62,000 people watched the opening ceremony, as well as live broadcasts on TSN and ESPN channels.
Did you know this happened?
What do you think of when you see someone like me?
I want you and me to be here today to look at us as equals.
The Special Olympics change the self-identity of intellectually disabled athletes.
It also changes the perspective of everyone who watches, and for those of you who don't know, I'm going to tell you that it's not the same as
The Special Olympics are a competition for athletes with intellectual disabilities.
It's separate from the Paralympics and the Olympics, and we're going to change the quality of life and the people's view for the sake of the intellectually disabled.
This movement has changed not only my life, but also the lives of many others, and the world has seen the intellectually disabled.
It also changed the way you look at it.
I was born with epilepsy and intellectual disability.
When I was a kid, I played hockey until I was twelve, and the bigger I was, the harder it was to keep up with the standards of other kids, so I was frustrated and angry.
I didn't do any exercise for a while, I didn't have many friends, I was lonely and sad.
There was a time when the intellectually disabled were hidden in society.
No one knew they were going to exercise, and they didn't know they were going to be a valued member of society.
In the 1960s, Dr. Frank Hayden, a scientist at the University of Toronto, was studying the impact of general exercise on the health levels of children with intellectual disabilities.
Through thorough scientific research, Hayden and other researchers concluded that children with intellectual disabilities lacked access to exercise, resulting in poor health.
Many people doubted that many health programs or sports competitions would be of great benefit to the intellectually disabled.
But Dr. Hayden and the founder of the Special Olympics, Mr. Yunis Kennedy Shripper, were not a pioneer, and the Special Olympics athletes proved them four and a half million times.
Before joining the Special Olympics, I was very anxious, because I was young, timid, I didn't have confidence, I didn't have many friends.
But the moment I got on that stage, everyone encouraged me, supported me, and helped me to be completely myself, regardless of the other person’s gaze.
I'm now a basketball player and a speed skater, and I've competed in various local and national competitions, and I competed in the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles this year, and I was the first player in Canada's history to compete in the World Games.
I'm one of more than four and a half million athletes in the world, but I've heard a lot of similar stories.
Being a Special Olympian restores our self-esteem and self-esteem.
The Special Olympics also deal with important health needs.
Many studies have shown that on average, men with intellectual disabilities die thirteen years earlier than ordinary men, and women with intellectual disabilities die twenty years earlier than ordinary women.
The Special Olympics keep us healthy by keeping us moving and engaging in exercise.
Our coaches also teach us about nutrition and health.
In addition, special Olympics offers free health screenings for athletes who have difficulty communicating with doctors or those who have difficulty getting health insurance.
At the Summer Olympics, my Canadian colleagues and I played against the Nigerian national basketball team.
On the day before the game, Nigeria's national team attended a health checkup for players at the World Games, and seven out of ten players were given free hearing aids to be able to hear for the first time in their lives.
The changes that came to them were huge.
They were more excited, happier, more confident, because they could communicate with the director.
And I was thrilled, because I heard the sound of the basketball, the whistle, the cheers of the crowd -- because of these sounds that are so obvious to us.
Special Olympics does not only change athletes in one sport.
It's changing their lives outside the stadium.
According to a study this year, half of adults in the U.S. don’t know a single person with an intellectual disability, and 44 percent of Americans who are not personally related to intellectual disabilities have much less respect for them.
There's also the word "ᄇ," which means that the intellectually disabled are invisible to a lot of people.
People use this word as a light word and as an insult.
Last year, the word was mentioned on Twitter more than nine million times, and it's a huge wound for me and my four and a half million fellow athletes around the world.
A lot of people think it’s not offensive, but it’s not.
My colleague and global messenger, John Franklin Stevens, responded openly to a political expert who used the word "ᄇ" as a profanity, and said, "Whenever you're here with us at the Special Olympics.
Let's see if you can walk away without changing your mind. "
This year, at the Summer Olympics, people lined up for hours to see the weightlifting final.
In the end, it was just a seat, and my proud colleague Jackie Barrett took 297kg and lifted 277kg from squats, the best record in the history of the Special Olympics.
Jackie is the highest-record holder of all the weightlifters in Newfoundland, not just in the Special Olympics, but at all the weightlifters.
Jackie was a huge star in LA, and ESPN updated his record on Twitter in real time, admiring his game.
Fifty years ago, not many people thought that intellectually disabled people would achieve this.
Sixty thousand spectators gathered at this year's LA Memorial Coliseum to watch the opening ceremony of the World Games, and cheered on numerous athletes from 165 countries around the world.
Far from being hidden, we were encouraged, celebrated.
Special Olympics teaches athletes to be confident and self-esteemed.
The Special Olympics teach the world that people with intellectual disabilities are part of our society that deserves respect.
I now have dreams, I have achievements, I have great coaches, I have respect and self-esteem, and I'm much healthier now, and I'm trying to be a personal trainer.
I'm here to give a TED Talk, I'm no longer in hiding or being teased.
The world has changed a lot thanks to the Special Olympics, but there is still a long way to go.
So the next time you meet an intellectually disabled person, look at his talent.
The next time someone around you uses the word 'ᄇ', I want you to let me know how much of a hurt that little word is.
I also want you to participate in the special Olympics.
Let me say one last thing.
Nelson Mandela said, "Sport has the power to change the world."
The special Olympics are changing the world. We are changing the four and a half million players, giving us a place where we can stand more confidently, meet our friends, be unappreciated, feel like champions, and be champions.
Thank you.
You may not have heard of Kenema or Aru.
But I know these two places are the most bizarre places on Earth.
There are communities of nurses, doctors and scientists who are quietly confronting humanity's greatest mortal threat for years: the Lassa virus.
The Lassa virus is very similar to Ebola.
It can cause severe fever, and it's very deadly.
And yet they risk their lives every day to protect those who are here, and to protect us all.
But the strangest thing I learned about them when I first visited them a few years ago was that they start their day on the hard front lines with a song.
And they gathered together for joy.
They show their own determination.
And over the years, when I visit them, or when they visit me, we come together, we sing and write and we have fun, because it tells us that what we're here to pursue just to pursue science is united by the tenacity of the people we share.
As you might think, that process has become very important and essential even when something changes.
And in March, when the Ebola outbreak was declared in Guinea, it changed a lot of things.
This was the first outbreak in West Africa, near the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia.
And I was very scared, we were all afraid.
We actually suspected for some time that Lassa and Ebola were more widespread than we thought, and one day they would come to Kenema.
So the members of my research team were immediately dispatched and joined Dr. Humarkan and his team, and we prepared a precision molecular diagnosis to let us know right away if Ebola crosses the border into Sierra Leone.
We've already built this system for the Lassa virus, and we knew how to deal with it this time, and this team is very good.
We just need to give them the tools and a place to investigate Ebola.
And unfortunately, that day came.
On May 23rd, a woman was admitted to a hospital obstetrics and gynecology department, and her team performed an important molecular diagnosis to confirm the first case of Ebola in Sierra Leone.
And this was a really great thing.
They were able to diagnose this case immediately, and start a contact tracing investigation to safely treat the patient and see what was going on.
Maybe he could have stopped something.
But by the time that day came, the Ebola had been multiplying for months.
With hundreds of cases, we've already surpassed the diseases that have occurred in the past.
And it's not a single case in Sierra Leone, it's like a hatchet.
We worked with the international community, the health community, the Kinema, and we worked hard on the case, 31 cases a week, then 92, then 147 cases, all came to Kenema, the only place we could deal with in Sierra Leone.
And we've been doing all the time we can, trying to help people, trying to get attention, but we've done another simple thing.
In a sample from a patient's blood to find Ebola, of course, you can discard it.
All we could do was put chemicals in it, deactivate it, put it in a box, and carry it across the ocean, and we did.
I sent my team to Boston.
We continued to work tirelessly every day, and we created ninety-nine Ebola genomes.
This was the blueprint for the genome of the virus.
We all have them.
It talks about everything that makes us, and it gives us a lot of information.
The results of these experiments are very simple and impactful.
We were able to look at these ninety-nine different viruses and compare them, and we could see that by actually comparing the three genomes that had actually occurred in Guinea a few months ago, and we could show that it was human-to-human.
This is very important to know how to intervene, but more importantly, contact tracing.
We could see that the virus was spreading among people and deforming.
And each mutation was very important, because different diagnostics and vaccines, the lightness we were using, all of these were based on the sequence of genes that fundamentally move the virus.
So global health professionals had to react to this, develop it, re-emeasure everything they did.
But the way science works where I was at that point is, I'm going to collect the data, I'm working in the isolation room for months, and I'm going to analyze the data very carefully and slowly, and I'm going to propose a paper to publish, and I'm going to research it, and I'm going to do it, and then it's going to be distributed.
That's how the current situation works.
But it's not going to work at this point, right?
We had friends on the front lines and what we obviously needed was help, a lot of help.
So the first thing we did was, as soon as the genome sequences were found in the machine, they were released on the web.
I said to the world, "Please help me."
And the helping hand came.
Before we knew it, people from all over the world were in touch, and I was surprised to see the public data.
A very great virus tracker was with our community at some point.
We worked together in a virtual way, sharing, regular phone calls, communication, and so on, and we tried to find different ways to stop the virus from happening, from time to time.
There are many ways to build these communities.
And as disease outbreaks spread around the world, everyone reached out to learn, participate, and engage with the disease.
Everyone wanted to take on the role.
The amount of human capacity shown here is amazing, and the Internet has connected us all.
Instead of saying to each other, you say, "Let's do this.
Can you imagine us working together?”
But the problem was in the data that we were all using, and Googlering on the web was limited to doing what we had to do.
And when that happens, you miss a lot of opportunities.
In the early days of the Kinema epidemic, we had a clinical record of 106patients, and we released it to the world again.
And in our lab, we were able to train computers to give you access to a 106th record and to predict the prognosis of Ebola patients with a hundred percent accuracy.
And we've created an app that can be used by medical staff in the field.
But the number 106 was not enough to make it strong and acceptable.
So we're waiting for more data to be released.
That data is still not coming.
We're still waiting in the quarantine room, and we're improving instead of working together.
And we won't be able to accept this fact.
I don't think we're all going to be able to accept it.
Our lives are in danger.
And in fact, a lot of lives were lost, including a lot of medics, my colleagues, five colleagues: Embalu Pony, Alex Moigboy, Dr. Humar Khan, Alice Koboma and Mohamed Pula.
These are five of the many medics who died in Kenema and the rest of the world, waiting for us, when we were all working, quietly, apart.
You know, Ebola, like all threats to humanity, is exacerbated by distrust, dispersal, and division.
When we build barriers that divide each other, and fight each other, the virus thrives.
But unlike everything that threatens humanity, the place where we are all the same human is Ebola.
We are all fighting this fight together.
Ebola in a family can be ours at any moment.
So with the same vulnerability, the same power, the same fear, the same hope, I hope that we can work together joyfully.
One of my graduate students was reading a book about Sierra Leone, and he found that the word "Kennema," the hospital where we worked and the city we worked in Sierra Leone, came from the Mende word, "It's as clean as a river, it's transparent, it's open to the public eye."
It surprised us all, because before we knew it, we always felt that in order to honor the people in Kenema, we had to work openly, to share, to work together.
And it has to be.
We all need to ask from ourselves and from others, to open our hearts to each other when we have disease and to talk to each other and fight together.
This is not the first outbreak of Ebola, and it's not the last, and there are a lot of microbes waiting outside, besides the Lassa virus.
And the next time this happens, it can happen in tens of thousands of cities.
It could be an airborne disease.
It can be spread intentionally.
We know it's scary, but we also know that this experience shows that we have the skills and the ability to win this, and we have the upper hand over the virus.
But we can only achieve it together, and we must be happy.
So for Dr. Khan, and for the countless others who have always sacrificed with us on the front lines of this fight, let us always be with them in this fight.
Let's not be defined as a world destroyed by the virus, but unite to shine through the minds and minds of billions of people.
Thank you.
