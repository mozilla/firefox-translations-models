When I was seven, I couldn't read, and all the girls in my class could read.
So I kept charging myself and blaming myself because I wanted to learn like everyone else.
Then my mother bought me several books that came with CDs and I kept listening to CDs and kept following along, because I couldn't read.
Anyway, I learned to read.
And when I learned to read, the whole world opened up to me.
I started dreaming things I thought I couldn't do but the books said, "You can!"
And one of those dreams was to go to university.
No one in my family has a college degree.
But I believed I had to go to university.
So I went there.
I have to go to university.
I have to.
I told my mom, "I have to go to university."
She went there, paid for a little course for me, with all the difficulties she had.
And I went to university at the age of 18.
In an extremely elite course, which is Architecture and Urbanism, in one of the largest universities in the country.
And then I thought, "Wow, it's my happy ending!
I'm amazed, it's all set."
Except no.
The university is not a welcoming space for people like me, regardless of the course.
What determines the welcome you will have is your color.
And I still, in addition to the color, was a woman.
And I liked to talk, to talk a lot.
But not to talk like that, on a stage.
Using writing, and it bothers you.
So I started to feel bad in that space, and you go feeling bad, you feel bad, And when you see it, you're very sad.
And you're not sad one day, you're sad a month, a year.
You don't want to leave the house anymore.
And I didn't want to leave the house anymore.
I was depressed.
The height of that was when I ended up in a hospital.
And then I was in a crisis, I couldn't speak.
I just wanted to cry.
I just wanted help.
And then that doctor looked at me and said, "You're depressed."
Now what?
In 1996, I was three years old and my father left home.
And then my mother found herself alone, pregnant, and with a three-year-old daughter.
That's the story of many women.
Even many women like me, black.
And my mother, to deal with it, she wrote a letter to me.
I was three, I couldn't read.
I told you that I learned well after everyone else.
But she wrote.
And then I understood that my mother had actually written that letter, which I went to read years later, because she wanted to deal with that pain.
And after a few years, my grandfather died.
And he was like a father to me.
And he was the first man in my grandmother's life, the only one.
The person to whom she gave her life.
And she misses it.
I miss it.
So... Every day my grandmother writes to him.
And I cry because it's daily, it's every day.
She opens a notebook and she writes, "Dear Daniel..." and she tells him her day.
And then... Years later I read a book called "Eviction Room," which is also a diary of a black, poor, favela woman who also had to take care of her children without a man present.
And she did it by picking cardboard on the street.
And this woman, she says in the book, that when she gets nervous, when she can't handle day-to-day situations, she would write.
And she would write on papers that she would pick up in the trash And then I needed help and I thought, "If all these women who are important in my life write, why can't I write?"
So I started writing.
He wrote in diaries.
Then I started writing poetry, I started writing on social networks, then someone said: "Don't you want to write a text on my blog?"
I said, "Oh!
Why not?"
Then I started writing on one blog, then another.
I wrote in a column here, something else there.
I started having thousands of followers, who were black women like me, who would text me and say, "What you write is about me, it's for me."
And I said, "Guys!
That's a lot bigger than I imagined."
Then, this year, at the age of 23, I was invited, by the largest publisher in the country, to write a book.
(Applause) And I say that because writing is important to me.
Writing, as the writer Paulina Chiziane says, literature for her is the way she negotiates her dignity.
Writing is that to me.
So I'm here to try to say what I do to deal with the weaknesses that I can't have, because I'm a black woman, Society says I have to be strong, that I can't come here and cry, that I can't go on my social network and say how hard it is to live without a father,  for instance.
Society says I have to put up with everything behind my back.
Society says I have to be strong, strong, strong.
I can't take it anymore.
I don't want to be strong anymore.
I want to be able to be weak.
So I write, even not to feel so much guilt, to forgive myself.
I suggest you do that, because for me writing is a cure.
Thanks.
(Applause)
My uncle came to Brasilia in 1972, carrying this suitcase here.
That was all he had.
And inside that suitcase, there was more book than clothes.
It's funny, but for his project, it made perfect sense, because he came to Brasilia with a very clear goal in his head: "I'm going to Brasilia to be able to study and win in life through studies."
That's why he brought so much book into the suitcase.
After he came, my whole family came coming too, and in this came my mother to make the same move as my uncle: "I'm going to Brasilia to study and make my career there."
This whole story happened before I was born.
When I was born, this suitcase was already here.
And the design of this suitcase worked out super well for both my uncle and my mother: they studied and won in life.
So, by the natural logic of things, a project that worked for my uncle and worked for my mother would work for me as well.
But when I went to school, I didn't find myself in school, I didn't do well.
And then, very early, I started suffering from Sunday night syndrome, which was a desperate ghost that would show up on Sunday to say, "Oh, tomorrow's Monday and you're going to have to do something that you don't like to do.
You're going to have to carry a suitcase that you don't want to carry."
I have suffered from this syndrome almost all my student life and much of my professional life as well.
To give you an idea, out of every ten people, seven suffer from Sunday night syndrome.
It is quite likely that you suffer from this syndrome as well.
And, if you suffer from this syndrome, it's because Monday you're doing something you don't like to do, carrying a suitcase you don't want to carry.
The first time I got rid of this syndrome was by the greatest luck in the world.
A teacher showed up at my school and she put everyone to do what she liked to do the most, and it was really cool because I started to enjoy Monday.
But I grew up, entered the job market, became a publicist and, after a while, the syndrome bothered me again, only this time it was much worse, because I had an established career, I had a child to raise and I had a lot of bills to pay.
I had the profession I wanted, the position I wanted, the salary I wanted, but I wasn't well.
And the truth is this: it doesn't matter your profession, your position, your salary.
The truth is, if you suffer from the syndrome, it's because you carry a suitcase you don't want and you keep doing it because you have bills to pay.
I wanted you to stop and think a little bit: what if you didn't have bills to pay?
What were you going to do with your life?
There are people who will say, "Wow, I can't even stop to think about it.
I have so many bills to pay..." (Laughter) Or, "No, I wouldn't do anything.
I was going to travel or watch Netflix all day, I don't know."
But think a little bit, really: you would want to spend your time and energy doing what?
If the answer came into your head there, your way out is there.
You will stop suffering from Sunday night syndrome when you start putting this into practice.
And so if the answer didn't come into your head, if the answer didn't appear at that moment, you need to find it because this is very serious.
Really, this is very serious.
It is very likely that when you find what you want to do with your life, you do not know how to do it and maybe you want to take everything inside your suitcase at once and put everything at once as well.
It's just that this is not how you are going to make such an important change in your life.
We change what is inside our suitcase little by little.
For example, if you enjoy photography, you want to be a photographer, you need a camera in your suitcase.
Of course, you don't need an entire photo studio.
You need to put photography in your life.
If you like to cook, start testing some elaborate recipes with your friends, start doing it for free at first, start experimenting at first, put cooking in your life.
When you least realize it, your suitcase will be complete and full of things you have decided to carry, things you have chosen, things that make sense to you and that are of use to other people as well.
My suitcase is lightweight and easy to carry.
What I carry in this suitcase today is a project I chose.
It's not my uncle's project, my mother's project, an advertising project.
It's a project that I chose, which is to help people figure out what they like to do and they can find ways to make a living out of it.
On Sunday night, you will remember this conversation that we are having today.
Maybe because you're okay with Monday's arrival; It's doing something you enjoy, or because Sunday night syndrome is bothering you.
If it's because of the syndrome, go pack your bag.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Alive)
(Music) â™ª See, my good I feel inform you That I have arranged someone to comfort me This someone is When you go out And I can only believe, for without having you In such arms See, love Where are you?
We are on paper But not in living Travel without me Leave me like this I had to get Someone to spend the bad days Meanwhile Sailing I go without peace Without having a port Almost dead, without a pier And I will never forget you, love But loneliness Leaves the heart In this takes and brings See well beyond these vile facts Know,  Betrayals Are much more subtle If I exchanged you It was not for evil Love, you see, I got someone Called "saudade" Love, you see, I got someone Called "saudade" Love, you see, I got someone Called "saudade" â™ª (End of the song) (Applause) Thank you.
Thanks.
Good morning!
I was born prematurely, in Rio de Janeiro.
My father had traveled to do the first international show, and he got there in Portugal, called Brazil and my mother was in the hospital, had had a placental abruption and I was almost born.
He came back the same day, the show in Portugal was cancelled, and I was born a month later.
(Laughter) It was the first time I stepped in.
I grew up in this family of artists, very affective, very sincere.
My first attempt in the art world was in ballet.
My mother put me in the school where she studied in her youth.
It didn't last a month.
I liked the classes, but one day the teacher said that the uniform was mandatory and I never came back.
My second attempt was in music.
I started studying piano... sorry, it wasn't piano.
I started by studying recorder and singing, and soon after I joined a children's choir.
And I spent all my afternoons in music school, I created a very strong bond with that space and with those people.
Then, one day, there was a performance in a hall of a university here in Porto Alegre, with the choir, and for the first time I was going to be a soloist.
In a moment I sang the main voice alone.
I've always been very shy, so singing in a huge auditorium didn't sound very comfortable to me.
And music, until then, was a joke for me, and suddenly I found myself in a responsibility to the group.
Anyway, there were many rehearsals, I was very nervous, but we made the presentation, everything worked out.
I was happy, a little relieved.
And then, I'm leaving the stage, happy and such, and a lady came towards me, smiling, she stops in front of me, congratulates me and says, "Honey!
It couldn't be any different.
It's in the blood."
I didn't understand what she was telling me.
It was very strange.
What did she mean by that?
I didn't take it as a compliment, really.
It was weird, but deep down it was a little frustrating.
She was referring to my father, who was a musician, or my mother who is also an artist.
Is it in the blood?
You mean I was born with that?
He has several studies in this area.
There is a research that was done in Canada by a Brazilian researcher, with 30 babies.
And some of these babies were exposed to a prelude to Maurice Ravel, for ten days, three times a day.
At the end of this process, all the babies were subjected to a test, and those who listened to the music at home during the week paid more attention to it than to the other works.
That is, they developed a musical sensibility by being exposed to music.
I was born into a very musical family.
There was piano at home, any birthday had a band in the room.
I have also developed a musical sensibility, but the environment in which we are inserted contributes to the development of our skills, our skills.
And I read research that was done in the United States, that when public schools had a short budget, they took music aptitude tests to see who could attend music lessons.
That is, the idea was to select those who had ease or genetic predispositions to music.
And they applied that same test to the instrumentalists of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which is a large orchestra.
And half of the musicians scored below average.
Half the musicians.
That is, according to these tests, none of those musicians had genetic predispositions to do so, to work with it.
But they were there, and they're great instrumentalists in a big orchestra, it wasn't the blood that got them there.
We have the record, we human beings have the biological, the psychological and the imaginary record.
And there is no prevalence of one record over the other.
We are the binding of the three.
Today I understand the discomfort and frustration I had when I was little.
I don't deny genetics, I don't deny the influence of the social environment even before I was born.
But none of this would have made me a singer if it hadn't been my choice.
It's not just in the blood.
Thanks.
(Applause)
In the month of May, it's been eight years since I've been part of this project, that I'm dedicating everything I have.
But basically, I like to say that I'm dedicating half my breath to this project that I'm going to talk about to you today, and that it's giving results that we thought should happen, just not with the speed that they're happening.
Eight years ago, I was introduced to an illness that, until then, I didn't know about, and that it's quite likely that most of us all here don't know.
Even medical professionals know, but are not necessarily prepared or know how to act when it is identified.
I'm talking about sepsis, also commonly known as hospital infection or sepsemia, several other words that, when not known, talk about it.
Even a Brazilian research institute did a survey last year and asked on the street if people knew what sepsis was.
Ninety percent of them thought it was a rock band.
(Laughter) This lack of knowledge is general.
Sepsis, since it was identified as organic dysfunction, has killed more than 100 million people worldwide.
Sepsis is a disease that kills more than a traffic accident, not only in Brazil, but worldwide.
Every two minutes, sepsis kills a person worldwide, and on May 28, 2010, sepsis killed my daughter.
On May 29, I had to close a grave and I didn't know what to do with all the love and anticipation I built on those 18 days she stayed with us.
Laura was born on May 10, 2010 and she changed the interface with me on May 28, 2010.
Since that day, I am dedicating absolutely everything I have: my heritage, house, car... bike.
That's the hardest part.
(Laughter) Everything.
Today I dedicate my whole life, all my energy; today I share this project with 25 people who are completely passionate about what we are doing.
Today Laura is deployed in a few dozen hospitals and transacting the data of millions of patients.
What she's doing in each of these hospitals is identifying which patient has sepsis.
I'll explain a little bit more how it works, but I think that, first of all, you need to understand what is the limitation that exists in this context.
If we look at other diseases, other operational problems, they are related to organic triggers, biological triggers.
A person who has a heart problem will automatically have heart failure, and this will trigger a protocol.
Sepsis does not have a biological trigger.
It simply brings together several factors that end up deteriorating the patient's clinical situation, regardless of whether it is an ICU patient or a patient who is inside a bed in a normal ward.
He takes that risk.
In fact, any of us run the risk of having sepsis at any time.
The difference from other diseases is that sepsis is completely controllable if it is seen in time.
If, in the interval of time, the professionals manage to make the necessary interventions, at least from sepsis the person does not die.
She will pass away maybe from the comorbidities of her disease, she will die from other problems, but from sepsis she does not die.
That's what we're doing.
I developed the world's first cognitive risk management platform.
They are robots with artificial intelligence that connect to hospital databases, that connect to laboratory machines and remotely analyze this information hours in advance.
They make this transit in a fraction of a second inside the hospital and can advance in approximately ten hours the person's risk picture.
They indicate, of all patients admitted to the hospital, which of them are at risk of sepsis, which of them are at risk of being in a clinical deterioration that will lead that person to sepsis.
Today, two years after we activated Laura...
The first hospital in which we activated the robot was on July 26, 2016, in a philanthropic hospital in Curitiba, in fact, the bravest of all, because the sisters had the courage, which many others did not have, to bring an innovative technology, an unknown technology, but a technology produced here, Brazilian, made with love, made with affection,  made with attention, but that is cutting-edge, that leaves nothing to be desired for anyone.
They accepted us to activate this technology in Curitiba, and since then, Laura has saved hundreds of people.
She identifies, more than ten hours in advance, who will have this problem.
In addition, it is transacting the data of millions of people, and all this with the sole purpose of accelerating the diagnosis or prediction that this is happening.
We could treat that in a variety of ways.
Technology in healthcare is not new.
Artificial intelligence is not new.
But what is behind this project is a simple word, it is something related to what we all have and give for free: love.
I could have taken all that expectation of mine and put it on another platform, or I could have put it in other conditions or forgotten or treated grief in other ways.
But that's not the loss that has motivated me.
It's the love for Laura, and the promise I made to her on May 29 that no one would forget her name in this era and that no mother would sleep crying anymore because of a totally controllable situation, is happening today, and will soon help many more people around the world.
So impacting a billion lives isn't hard, as long as you don't make your life restricted to pain or loss, you dedicate it to someone.
So, "bora" save lives with us?
Thanks, guys.
(Applause) (Alive)
RogÃ©rio Martins is a professor and researcher in mathematics at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the New University of Lisbon.
He bets on scientific dissemination to the general public, and is the author and host of the television program 'This is Mathematics'.
What would you like to reverse?
"The math picture, of course."
(Applause) RogÃ©rio Martins: I'm a mathematician, and I want to talk about some of the reasons why I fell in love with mathematics.
Contrary to what many people think, I have never really been a brilliant student of mathematics.
In fact, when I was a high school student I wasn't a brilliant student.
It wasn't that I wasn't interested in the subjects I was studying.
They actually interested me, and I always found all areas exciting.
In fact, it is one of the things I want to talk about to you.
But the truth is, I didn't have a great interest in getting good grades.
When I applied to college, I had several interests.
From economics to psychology, to biology.
But the truth is, I couldn't get into those courses because I didn't have enough grades to get in.
And I ended up getting into math.
For better or worse, because I immediately fell in love with mathematics.
I want to tell you, essentially, what made me fall in love with mathematics.
Suddenly, from average grades, enough to pass, I went on to have one of the best averages in the course.
What made me fall in love with mathematics?
I would say the first reason was when I realized that mathematics was about ideas.
In high school, I found math interesting, but there were a lot of accounts, I didn't realize what the Big Picture was.
I'd say the math is to math, as dribbling is to basketball.
In fact, we have to know how to dribble to play basketball.
But what's really beautiful, is to see the game, to see the game happening, to see the play from behind.
See the strategy.
And it's exactly the same with music, as we saw earlier.
It is true that we have to practice climbing, but what is beautiful is to listen to the complete work and enjoy it.
With mathematics it's the same thing.
And I realized one day that, in fact, mathematics was much more about ideas than I thought.
It is much more of a philosophy of life, than a set of disjointed and meaningless equations.
That was one of the reasons that led me to fall in love with Mathematics.
The second was that I realized I could come up with a lot of thingsâ€”a lot of those things that I liked: biology, economics, sociology, all of those things.
I could get there through math.
And this is in particular what I want to show you here, with a concrete example of my work in Mathematics.
It's true that I can't show equations, because they probably wouldn't realize them, but I can show something concrete, which has directly to do with what I do, and it's something I usually keep in mind when I study those equations.
The idea is this: Now I'm going to do an experiment.
I have two cans here, I have a board, which I'm going to put here on top of the cans, and here I have two metronomes.
The metronomes, I don't know if you know, are a device that serves to measure compasses.
Basically it's a clock that musicians use to measure times.
These metronomes are set to a certain frequency, in this case, 208 beats per minute â€” it's a very useful one.
I'll put it up here.
Hear?
I have another metronome here.
In fact, these metronomes, although they are regulated to the same frequency, do not oscillate in sync.
By the way, I've now dropped them here, but they tend not to have exactly the same frequency, even though they're regulated to the same frequency.
What's curious, is that when I put them on top of this board, if you wait a while... ... a strange thing happens.
They interfere with each other.
I don't know if it's visible from there, but this board oscillates slightly, and they end up synchronizingâ€”now they've come back down.
This synchronization is not immediate, but after a while they end up synchronizing.
This is fantastic, because we humans synchronize many times, when we play an instrument, or when we dance.
But that two inanimate objects can do this, in a way, communicate with each other and come to the conclusion of what rhythm they should follow, is indeed an impressive thing.
This phenomenon, which we are observing, is something that was discovered by Christiaan Huygens in the seventeenth century.
He discovered this by chance, by chance he had two metronomes on top of the same shelf.
Then it was forgotten for many years and recently, it was realized that after all it is a much more common phenomenon than previously thought.
For exampleâ€”I'll give several examples: In biology, it appears in fireflies.
Fireflies have a flash, and that flash is periodic.
Just as a metronome oscillates periodically, the firefly also turns a light on and off periodically, and interferes with neighbors.
And a fantastic thing happens in certain firefly communities: they synchronize movements and suddenly begin to adjust the flashes, and little by little, there are thousands of fireflies that synchronize their movement, as if each firefly were one of these metronomes.
They synchronize their movement and emit a flash all at the same time.
This is a case of synchronization in biology.
In economics there are also cases.
For example, markets fluctuate and each of them is as if it were also a metronome.
By oscillating they interfere with the neighbors through trade, exports, etc.
Once again, there is a phenomenon of synchronization here that economists study.
Then we have, for example, the case of the power grid.
I don't know if you know, we have an alternating current.
The current oscillates in our house, in our outlet.
And when an electrical engineer needs to connect a power plant to the national power grid, he needs there to be synchronization.
It needs the oscillation of the power plant to synchronize with the oscillation of the power grid.
Again, it is a synchronization phenomenon.
In medicine there is a very curious case, where there are several synchronization phenomena, something called the circadian cycle.
Already next we will have someone talking about neurobiology, here there is also a little neurobiology.
In medicine, this circadian cycle is actually an organ that we have in our body.
We have a set of cells that sets the rhythm of the day, 24 hours.
It is basically the clock that makes us go to bed always at the same time, or feel like eating at the same time.
It's what causes jet lag.
This clock is made of a set of cells, each of which interferes with the neighboring cell, and synchronizes the movement with the neighboring cell.
In fact, this set of cells is a synchronization phenomenon.
There are thousands of cells that synchronize in oscillation with neighboring cells.
Here we have another synchronization phenomenon.
Then our watch synchronizes with the day-and-night cycle.
Again, a synchronization phenomenon.
Very curious because, in this second, our clock, our metronome, is still disturbed by the day-and-night cycle, but the day-and-night cycle is not disturbed by our clock, but even so there is a phenomenon of synchronization here.
This is to show you that this phenomenon, which appears in these metronomes, appears in many areas.
And what we mathematicians doâ€”actually we, myself in particular, don't have a laboratory full of metronomes to do experiments, and boards, and cans, and such.
But I have a brain.
I have a brain and I have equations.
What we do, essentially, is to extract the theoretical juice of these phenomena that happen in all these areas, and treat it mathematically, with equations, with mathematical tools.
That's the power of mathematics.
In fact, I would say that one of the phrases that best characterizes mathematics, was said by PoincarÃ©.
He says that "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things."
What is happening here, that is, when I mathematically study all these various phenomena, which occur in various areas of human knowledge, I am actually giving "the same name", the same mathematical name, to all these phenomena that were apparently distinct phenomena.
It wasn't realized they had a relationship until a few years ago.
And that's what math does.
Mathematics creates bridges.
PoincarÃ© himself says that the great advances in science occur when we manage to connect two things, apparently disconnected, and realize that they have something in common.
Usually this connection is made by mathematics.
And that's what's fantastic.
I would say that mathematics, or doing mathematics, is leaving a comprehensive footprint â€” comprehensive because when I work mathematically on a problem, like these of synchronization, which is what has occupied me for some time in the last few years, I am working at the same time on all these problems, and hence the connection with the beginning of my lecture, in which I said I liked all the areas.
I often even tell my students, or those people who are running for university, that if they like everything, maybe the best thing is mathematics, because in fact mathematics creates connections to everything.
So it's a footprint, I would say, comprehensive, permanent.
Permanent because it is permanent, mathematics has no time.
The Pythagorean Theorem is as valid two thousand years ago as it is today.
The math is either right or wrong.
If it's right, it's right, and it will stay that way forever.
If it's wrong, at most it can be (unintelligible) And there's some math that falls by the wayside because it's not interesting enough.
Or because it is not used, because it has not passed to the next generation.
But that's another matter.
That math was right, it's just not interesting.
Not all math is interesting.
Finally, there is a fantastic feeling of working in mathematics, which is the feeling of treading a path that we realize is, in fact, unknown land.
It's the feeling that we've reached a place where it was impossible for someone not to get there one day.
This is felt, above all, in mathematics.
It is very often that we construct theories and realize that those theories are not the fruit of our imagination.
They were there, that is, an intelligent being from another planet would probably arrive at the exact same location.
It would come to exactly the same conclusionsâ€”though eventually with a different languageâ€”but, say, the mathematical juice was there, that mathematical idea was there.
And that's really another impressive thing.
Another phrase that I like very much â€“ this is a phrase that for a long time I had next to me on my desk and which is from Pascal â€“ says: "Through space, the universe embraces me and swallows me like a dot.
"By the thought, I'm the one who boards him."
This is, for me, the warrior's revenge, and once again it's mathematics.
When we feel small, physically, there is a certain comfort in thinking that, from a psychological point of view, our imagination, our thinking, is indeed great, and we can get to practically everywhere through our thinking.
In a way, there is a certain revenge of our smallness here.
To conclude, and to leave you a little to think, precisely with this thought that is comprehensive and powerful, I would like to show you what is perhaps the problem that will occupy me in the coming times.
Or in the next few years, perhaps.
In fact, in synchronization, we can't understand everything.
There's still a lot to realize, even a lot.
In fact, in mathematics, it is very common for people to have the feeling that it is a somewhat crystallized science, that there is no longer any research in mathematics.
In fact, it's the exact opposite.
Mathematics is one of the most active areas these days.
One of the things that we do not realize is the following: We have here these two metronomes, and we saw them oscillating, just now, in phase, that is, they oscillated the two to one side, the two to the other.
What happens is that Huygens didn't see this.
He had different metronomes, he actually had big clocks.
He saw the two of them swaying inward, and the two of them swinging outward.
And that's not exactly what we were seeing.
Now, it's possible that Huygens poured water.
(Sound of desynchronized metronomes) (Sound of synchronized metronomes) Here it is, thank you very much.
(Applause)
What we know and what we have already experienced make us who we are today.
Our questions, the ones to which we are seeking answers, will make us who we will be tomorrow.
Curiosity is what's behind these questions.
And curiosity is something I've discovered since I started doing research there in high school.
It just took me a while and it took me across an ocean, literally, to understand the power of that.
During high school, I did research, I studied at a school called FundaÃ§Ã£o Liberato, which is relatively close to here.
There, doing scientific research is a true tradition, so all students do research.
From the first year at that school, I started doing scientific projects.
My first project, together with Viviane and Gabriela, two colleagues from the technical course, was back in 2007 and we heard a lot about global warming and the gases that caused the greenhouse effect and we were very concerned about it.
After all, did our school, the school activities we did there, contribute to global warming?
And then, we did our first project, which was to calculate mathematically and with a lot of data collection, how much our school emitted gas, carbon dioxide, during its school activities; and how much it absorbed, because inside the school there was a eucalyptus plantation.
It was a mathematical account, it added and subtracted there, and we found that the balance was positive.
The school absorbed more gas than it emitted, that was great for the environment.
We did this project, presented it at science fairs... and we won nothing.
But, okay.
We went to the next stage, which was to do a new project.
Because of the eucalyptus plantations, we realized that nothing grew around the eucalyptus trees.
And then our second project was to create a natural herbicide with eucalyptus leaves.
What we did, basically, was to mix the eucalyptus leaves with water, to create an extract that could prevent the growth of weeds.
And then we went to a science fair again, showed this project and we didn't win anything.
But that's okay, we were learning a lot from this process.
And then, in the third year, I was no longer obliged to do a project, but we liked it so much, to go to fairs and not win anything, that it made a lot of sense to continue.
And then we wanted to do something more challenging, it was already our third project.
We decided to completely change areas, maybe the "zica" was because we were working with the environment, so let's go to the health area.
And then we decided to create a dressing with nanoparticles.
From a family history, I already knew a little about the amputation process.
The idea was to create a dressing that could be used in the postoperative period of amputation and reimplantation of limbs.
Basically what we did was to put in this tissue some nanoparticles that had an antimicrobial effect, then prevented bacteria and fungi from proliferating, and another that had a thermal insulating effect, so it would warm the skin and increase blood flow.
Again we went with this project to a fair.
And we didn't win anything.
But then we went to another one and started winning some awards.
Some of that experience led me to the fourth project, which is basically a continuation of that third.
After studying so much about the process of amputation and reimplantation of limbs, I realized that most amputations occurred in people with diabetes, usually in the lower limbs, because these people develop some typical problems, which we call diabetic foot.
And the idea was to use that same fabric to create a sock that could treat diabetic foot.
Because of these projects, I lived experiences that were incredible.
I started winning some awards and that taught me a lot.
But basically, let's think about how these projects occur, how they come about, how scientists work.
And then I wanted you to close your eyes and think about a wonderful phase of your life.
This, puberty, can open the eyes.
Puberty is a wonderful phase, a chaos of physiology.
And at puberty, we use the scientific method a lot.
Imagine you back when you were 13 when you looked in the mirror and suddenly noticed a red dot right in the middle of your forehead.
It was a spine.
Scientists start right there, by observing and then they identify the problem.
That's definitely a problem.
On the weekend you have a party and, heck, no one wants to take pimple at the party.
And then you go to the hypothesis.
And your hypothesis may be that you can remove that pimple using your hands.
And then the scientist leaves for the next step, which is the planning and execution of some experiment.
You go in front of the mirror and squeeze your spine.
And then we go to the result.
The result was terrible: his spine is now visible from 10 meters away.
Before you arrive at the party, she will arrive before and say "hi" to the guys.
And then we go to the conclusion, which is the final stage.
But in fact, it never ends, because always, in science, when you come to a conclusion it brings you many other questions.
Basically then, we start with observation, and we find a problem.
Create a hypothesis, plan and execute an experiment that brings results, a conclusion and again new questions.
I learned a lot when I was doing research; but I had not yet learned what was most special and essential about being a scientist.
And it took me going to Israel to see that.
In 2013, I was selected to go to Israel for a five-week research exchange at the Weizmann Institute, which is one of the largest research institutes in the world.
And I was there, in the midst of over 80 young people from all over the world, all about to enter university.
And I was put to work with my mentor, who was a neuroscientist named Hila Harris.
With her, what I was doing, basically, was trying to understand some of the brain's functionalities.
I would always come to her and ask, "Hila, what will we be able to solve when we understand what your project wants to unravel.
What problem are we going to solve?"
She was like, "Kawoana, I don't know what this is going to be for."
I was so frustrated with that, because in my vast experience as a scientist throughout my high school, I thought scientists were people who used the scientific method to solve problems.
It really wasn't anything like that.
At a dinner with the president of the institute, he told us that there at that institute scientists were selected for their degree of curiosity.
Curiosity was the word.
It didn't matter what his project was for, what mattered was how motivated he was to answer a question.
And I had never stopped to think that way.
I always thought about what the projects I was doing would be for.
But when you work motivated by your curiosity, to answer some questions to which we still have no answer, you go beyond the frontiers of knowledge, because you were not predicting that result and usually the results that we do not predict are great.
Thus, all too often, real problems are solved through the result of these researches that arose from the mere and genuine curiosity of scientists.
So curiosity seemed to be the key word of this process.
But it's not just any curiosity.
There is a phrase from EÃ§a de Queiroz that says: "Curiosity is the instinct that leads some to look through the keyhole and others to discover America."
So that seemed to tell me that there were questions that deserved to be asked.
And it's about this scientist's look, about this curious look, that I'd like to talk to you.
What are the questions you want to answer?
And to rescue this look it is necessary to go back a little to being a child.
Children are always full of questions.
After all, where do babies come from?
After all why the sky blue, why do I have to sleep at this time and why do I have to go to the bath?
Children are always full of questions, but when we become adults we become full of certainties.
We think we know who we are and how the world works.
And we forget to ask questions.
And then we forget that to be a scientist is to want to break paradigms; have a curiosity that is genuine and a willingness to change the world.
When we turn on the TV, open the social networks, the newspaper, every day, what we look at is a world full of certainties, of facts: politicians in Brazil are corrupt, public health in Brazil does not work, and public education is terrible; you have to take care when you go out on the street because it's all so violent.
And we forget that certainty leaves us in our comfort zone and that it is in the questions that we grow.
If we were more of a scientist, if everyone here saw themselves as a scientist, we would forget the certainties and ask questions.
After all, how can I improve education in our country?
Could it be that if I reduce social inequalities, I can interfere in urban violence?
So to be a scientist is to bring more questions to the game.
And it's about these questions that I'd like to share with you my current questions because since I started doing research, I've started to be more restless.
I discovered that I could be the protagonist, and that of all these problems that we see in the newspaper, I could choose one, the one that maybe made my heart beat stronger and try to create a question, so draw an experiment, reach some result and maybe change a little of reality.
Thus came a project called Beta Scientist.
I did research all my high school, and after a while, I didn't know much about what to make of that experience, other than simply telling people that I had done it.
I have a father at home who always said I had to write about it, tell young people that they could live it, there were so many young people who didn't know they could do that.
Inside me was a question that made my heart sleep every day tight, which was what I can do with all this that I lived.
Is it possible to transform the lives of other young people, as mine has been transformed?
Once you're a scientist, you have a question, you have two choices: either you put it in the drawer and forget it, or you're going to do an experiment.
And so came an initiative called Beta Scientist, which connects young Brazilians with science.
What we do is, with a group of very engaged and very committed people, we connect young people who are in high school to scientific projects.
We encourage these young people to start looking at the world with a curious eye of a scientist.
We say they can be restless and no problem, that's great.
That those problems that they see in the world around them can be solved and that they can create a scientific project to propose some kind of solution.
What we do is offer content on how to do research, mentors from all over the country who have already done research and start to accompany these young people, and challenges.
So I ended up somehow answering some of my questions.
That tight question now had an answer: yes.
Doing a scientific project during high school, having the eye of a scientist, can change the lives of these young people and is changing the lives of young Brazilians.
I can see in the future, how much this can transform a little of our reality in education, in our country.
How much these young people, more than creating projects, what we are creating are young people who create projects and create solutions.
Young people who are more protagonists and who see themselves as part not of the problem, but of the solution.
But since I am a scientist and for me what matters are the questions, the question that is inside me today is: what great are these young people still going to do?
How will they still surprise us?
And for you, I wanted to ask what is the question that moves you?
It's about having a new look, it's about our own existence.
What is the question that sleeps and wakes up with you every day?
Are you giving vent to this question, creating an experiment, that brings you some result a conclusion, and again new questions?
In 2010, after that succession of events of doing a project, going to a fair, not winning anything, doing another project, going to a fair and again not winning anything, there came a time when I left the zero score, which was to go to a fair and not win anything, and then I managed to win a place in the largest science fair in the world,  which happens in the United States.
And being there, representing my country, completely transformed my life.
And I remember I was walking into the fair, first time in the United States, first time at an international event, first time going to show what I was doing, to people who spoke another language.
And then I walk into the fair and there's a very big sign written on: "Welcome to tomorrow."
Welcome to tomorrow.
And then I understood that all my search for the answers, while I was doing projects, made me build a tomorrow that did not exist.
So what I can leave you maybe is you thinking about what tomorrow you want to build.
Listen to the questions that are within you.
Because when we seek these answers, we build a future that does not yet exist and goes beyond the borders of what we know.
We create a better world, or at least we become better people.
After all, what we are and what we have already lived, what we know makes us who we are today.
And it is the questions, the ones to which we are incessantly seeking answers, that make us who we will be tomorrow.
Thank you.
(Applause)

â™ª (Applause) (Vivas) Hail, family.
I'm Rafa, I'm part of the rap group Rafuagi, and the message I come to leave for you here today is that I believe in the youth.
Does anyone believe in youth?
Do you believe in youth?
Audience: Yes!
Rafa Rafuagi: This all made me believe that, increasingly, creative solutions to the problems of our country emerge from the peripheries.
They emerge from the knowledge of the Global South, and this Global South made me understand and participate in various collectives during my trajectory.
Almost 20 years of hip hop go by, I started very early.
but in this, I could understand that, in fact, this knowledge of the Global South gave us the condition to create real impact projects within our communities, but, much more than that, transforming to what we would have liked to have happened, perhaps, when I was 15 years old, and it did not happen, it came to happen now, when I was 30.
But all this made me understand that believing in youth is also not just looking at our navel.
And, yes, to look for the diversity that exists, especially in South America.
From there I met the Festival Hip Hop al Parque, which today is our great reference, and is currently the largest window of dialogue that exists in Latin America, especially with peripheral youth.
Every day there are 100,000 people at this festival in BogotÃ¡, Colombia.
We were there in 2014, bringing this experience, and made us understand the possibility that there is, not only within hip hop, but precisely in these forms of dialogue that we have.
In addition, another project that we bring as a reference is Comuna 13, in MedellÃ­n, which has made MedellÃ­n a reference in public policies, not only in Colombia, but mainly in South America as a whole.
In this, in 2012, I met a friend who is called Boaventura de Sousa Santos, he is a sociologist, we have been working together ever since, and on that occasion, he asked me: "Look, Rafa.
If one day you could meet someone, who would that person be?"
Then I quoted, "Oh, Professor, Jay-Z.
Exchange an idea with Jay-Z."
Then everyone laughed: "No, Rafa is there in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Jay-Z is there in Brooklyn, in New York..." And the professor: "There is a theory that we are five steps away from anyone in the world."
"How so, Professor?
What talk is that?"
Five steps: Rafa is Bonaventure's friend, Bonaventure is Kenny West's friend, Kenny West is Jay-Z's friend, I was three people away from Jay-Z.
Everyone was stunned, not that I was three people away from Jay-Z, much more that Bonaventure was friends with Kenny West, they thought so... (Laughter) But that's okay, right?
What did he want to tell me, in practice?
That things were not as impossible as they seemed, if we articulated in a network, collectively, together, truly.
Now, for this, we began to think: with what can we join the boys, what will work?
In 2017, we created the Casa da Cultura Hip Hop de Esteio, the first in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the largest in Latin America.
There are 1,700 mÂ² in space, and this house is in Esteio, and I already invite you to know.
In a year and a half, more than 10,000 young people have passed through there; we always do an account: considering the average Brazilian family with four people, so there have been more than 40,000 people directly or indirectly impacted by ideas of solidarity and by the idea of a collective growth through the citizen and vocational training that these young people receive.
In 2018, we then brought an idea that is the UPMS, which now in 2019 has materialized, the Popular University of Social Movements, which at this very moment is happening temporarily at the headquarters of FMP, FundaÃ§Ã£o Escola Superior do MinistÃ©rio PÃºblico, here in Porto Alegre, which seeks, through popular knowledge, to bring out a new form of education within the academy,  but, much more than that, this ecology of knowledge, as we are doing here today, which is the exchange, is the sharing of information for a collective growth.
These projects are part of a tripod of projects in which we believe as a real transformative source of our communities.
The third is the Hip Hop Museum.
This museum does not yet exist, it will be created in 2022 in the Bronx, in the United States, but we are looking for this reference to also bring this experience to Brazil, precisely so that our memories, all these speeches that passed through here and spoke of memories, are eternalized and can, yes, inspire future generations, so that we can actually have a much greater consciousness while our self,  but, much more than that, a respect and a fairer society for all.
Through this, we can already see the result in practice, and this result goes beyond numbers.
And we say that this result generated engagement of people for all these causes, whether artists, like those who are here with me in the photo, such as ThaÃ­de, Afrika Bambaataa, but so many other names that we can talk about that participated and actively participate in this collective construction.
But actors and actresses from organizations, from institutions, such as the Public Ministry of Labor, through the allocation of TAC resources for the projects, be it the ILO, the International Labor Organization, which exclusively this year is turning 100 years old, or UN Women, through He for She.
There are several actors and actresses who are involved, precisely understanding and understanding that these projects are strategically essential for the practical transformation that we need in our society.
With this, we see that this network of partnership agreement refers us to a logical reasoning, which is what we believe, which is prevention.
I could give several examples of prevention here.
Could someone give me an example of what prevention is?
Is educating for diversity prevention?
Is giving equal conditions and opportunities prevention?
Is creating public policies prevention?
We also believe that.
We believe in this and, because we believe in it, we have sought to understand this larger system that, often, as AD [Junior] brought, puts young black people incarcerated en masse... And, for example, here in the Rio Grande do Sul Phase, there are currently 1,263 inmates.
If we made a basic account, today each young person who is interned in the Phase costs the state of Rio Grande do Sul R $ 12 thousand per month.
If we made an account about a thousand young people, today these thousand young people, per year, would have the cost of R $ 144 million.
With R$ 144 million, we keep open, serving 4 thousand young people a year, 480 Hip Hop Culture Houses.
This gives an audience contemplated by a public policy of 1 million and 920 thousand young people, which is configured almost 100% of the young population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
If we do that account of multiplying by four, of the family, there would be more than 7.6 million people impacted by a public policy of inclusion.
It would be almost 100% of the population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
And Rio Grande do Sul, which, by the way, is the most racist state in Brazil.
But for this to happen, it is necessary that this comrade, this young man, when he leaves the Phase, does not reoffend, he does not return to the Phase, because in this way, too, he is feeding back into the system.
And, in fact, this feature continues to be used, precisely, for that function.
But much more than that, it is to understand that when this young person leaves, it is necessary that our communities are prepared for this welcome.
Because going out and going back to sameness, in fact, nothing will help.
And today, there is a lack of public policies, a lack of respect, a lack of things within the communities that, increasingly, unfortunately, keep these young people within the system.
Now, for this, we saw that all this result, and that is what I seek to share with you here today, about these results, in fact, in practice, they only happened because, in fact, there was engagement and there was a strategic network thinking.
Today we act in a logic of multiplication of three, which is precisely this exchange through the sharing of information, of an idea.
For example, we started a network with 100 people, and this network, the idea was: I learned one thing, I'm going to pass it on to three other people.
Those three have learned, they will go on to six.
Those six, to nine and so on.
In this account, if we multiplied these 100, with 3 gave 300, these 300 with 6 gave 1,800, 1,800 by 9 gave 16,200.
But that, in practice, happened and showed us what?
That today our South America has a population of 587 million people.
I speak exclusively of South America, being our country, obviously, Brazil, the largest country of our continent.
But if we had the possibility of dialogue with these people, how could we do this in practice?
We started thinking that too.
And this logic of the multiplication of three, it came at a good time, to the extent that we were able to objectify faster and faster this sharing of information, whether with projects, or with examples, or with attitudes, or with any other way, for us to understand that, today, my great goal of life, as well as my partners,  that are running together, my partners too, is, in the next ten years, we will dialogue with the half of the continent of South America; 300 million people, so that our continent may be increasingly stronger, more in solidarity with each other, be a continent totally free of North American bonds, of European ties, but, much more than that, a continent that we can, in fact, say that this continent makes a difference in the world to the extent that people live with dignity.
And this, when I talk about dignity, is precisely that this mathematical account has managed to send us, we are already arriving at a very expressive number, but I make a challenge to you: today you heard many people, many ideas, many feelings, loaded with truth.
Who would be, for example, the three people you would come out of here and share what you heard or learned or liked here today?
Can you shout some people's names?
Who would the three people be?
Is it hard, like that?
Don't there are three people in your network?
The names, I want names, who are these people?
Scream there!
(Shouts from the audience) O JosÃ©, a Ana, o Felipe, o Tiago... (Screams) A Bruna, a Mari, o JoÃ£o... All these people.
It is important that we understand that these people are also in the same struggle and often what is missing is information.
I often say that information is power, and truth is revolutionary.
Now, it is necessary that we understand that, increasingly, we have to start from the zone of theory to practice.
The problems are urgent.
The causes are emerging.
And in this, for every speech, there has to be an action.
For every action you have to have a new idea.
So that we can truly see this transformation in practice, but much more than that, we can make new forms of resistance and new ways of proposing projects emerge within the peripheries.
My mother told me a sentence once, and I'll end here with that sentence.
Unfortunately my mother couldn't be here today, but she's sure to be watching me, and she says to me, "Look, it's not enough for us to be happy.
Others must not be disgraced."
And I'm going to look at that camera, because in a month I'm going to be a father and I'm going to say, "Augusto, it's for you, for you that I'm fighting and for all of us too."
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Alive)
So, I'm going to start here by talking about a love letter from Ademar Bogo in which he talks about education.
He goes something like this: that educating comes from the Latin "to take from within"; but the matter and the elements for education all come to us from the outside.
These things when they are out, when they enter, they turn into consciousness and when they come out, they should at least turn into actions.
So taking it out is an illustrative gesture.
One takes from within the consciousnesses first what one seeks.
Therefore, education has a valid function for all life, which is to awaken dormant actions and take from within us, actions of rebellion and restlessness so that we do not settle.
When they invited me to come and talk here about education, the first thing I did was talk to a history teacher, a friend of mine, and see some lectures about it.
In this, we realized how much is said about how the current model of education does not work.
But what is it to work?
And they want it to work for what?
Such a reform of high school, explicitly wants it to work for a training focused on the labor market.
Train cheap labor.
I, as well as the people of the occupations, also think that the current model of education does not work, but our idea of working is quite different.
For us, studying goes far beyond getting a job, making money to consume non-stop and continuing to sustain the structures of this system.
(Applause) (Alive) We hope that education, that the relationship with knowledge, will be a means for us to discover about the world and discover about society, and not to reproduce it, but to consciously participate in its transformations.
But in the society in which we live, to want this is to be a danger, and increasingly, we see being treated with bombs and gags who are fighting for this kind of "dangerous" education; anyone who cares about an education that helps to think, to problematize, and that uses the sciences to deconstruct prejudices, is suffering reprisal, is suffering persecution, and are having laws instituted against them.
Not that it is anything new that the laws are not aimed at a good for the working class, but they want to make it impossible for very important issues to be debated in school.
The school is an environment in which we spend a lot of our life, being there our first relationships with other individuals.
So, consequently, it should be there that we learn to deal with these other individuals and, mainly, respect them within each individuality.
But so, in the occupations, when we talked about these issues of our daily lives, which were often debated, we respected all thoughts, because we think and agree, that all people have different knowledge and none of this knowledge is more or less important than the other.
There was a guy who had thought this for a long time, and he is internationally recognized, but within this crazy conjuncture in which we are living, even he is being persecuted.
This guy is Paulo Freire, and he said... (Applause) that education doesn't change the world, education changes people, and people change the world.
He also thought that the student is not a warehouse in which the teacher has to dump things, and he has to absorb everything.
He believed, as I did, that the student and the teacher have to work together and learn new possibilities, and discover new things in life; and he saw education as a liberating pedagogy.
All of this may seem utopian, but I'm not alone, and the occupations have shown me that.
Utopias are what help us to walk, because even without knowing where we are going, they help us move forward.
I wanted to dedicate this speech to everyone, all and "all"... (Applause) who still walk and build this utopia together with me and who fight for an education, for a more just society, and who suffer reprisal for occupying the spaces they are trying to take away from us: the people who fight.
Thank you.
(Applause) (Alive)
What is a hacker?
A hacker is a person who is deeply dedicated to studying and modifying systems, devices, programs.
And thanks to this he can go beyond what is considered normal, within the standard functioning.
And he can even overcome barriers, which the creator himself thought were resolved.
There are no just evil hackers.
There are hackers for example, who work for the development of free software.
These people work in communities, in networks and they are usually driven by culture, ideology and motivations.
Culture, ideology and motivations.
So, inspired by this, I come to bring you today a proposal for us to "hack" life.
We hack that set of attitudes and prejudices that seem "normal", that were created by the system and that remain there.
I propose to hack life so that we can break the prejudice and study what we want, work on what you want, be what you want; create whatever you want, marry whomever you want, have sex with whomever you want.
Because if we live today in a world of such advanced technology, will we want to continue in a world of backward methodology?
Of course not!
And we women can mainly hack sexist software, in the neighborhood, in society, in schools, at home, at work.
If we stop to think about work, how often do women not come across aggressive men, who belittle their opinion, who interrupt them successively; interrupts once, twice, interrupts again and again and again.
So what we thought, me and my team at the agency, was that we could somehow help change this reality in the workplace.
Can we knock out this problem?
Maybe not, but we can throw a little punch.
Because sometimes a small screw prevents a plane from flying.
And with small punches, a set of small punches, we can win a fight.
When I look at this data here, I wonder how hard the reality of women is, right?
These data here, even, remind me a lot of a phrase of Glauber Rocha that said the following: "The function of the prophet is to prophesy, and not to get it right."
Far be it from me to say that the UN and McKinsey prophesied these numbers, they must have studied hard to be able to see the trends and make this projection of numbers, but Glauber's phrase gains meaning from the moment that, knowing that the projected data are these, we should work harder and move forward to reduce the time in which this reality will be changed.
When I look at this data here, I wonder if people know that there are reports and data that show that a work environment that has diversity is a more tolerant, fairer, more creative environment.
I wonder if people know that there are reports from the World Bank, the UN, McKinsey itself showing that in the environment where there is diversity, there is more productivity and, consequently, better results.
This directly impacts the results of companies.
But why does prejudice insist so much on persisting?
So when we see these sentences here...
How many times have many women not heard such things in their workplace?
Many.
Surely you know someone, or you yourselves must have heard things like this in the workplace.
Isn't that right?
Well, we decided to study one of the phenomena linked to prejudice against women in the workplace and that has to do with my area of expertise, which is communication.
So, there are several phenomena of prejudice of man against woman and "manterrupting" is one of them.
The "manterrupting" is nothing more than that persistent habit of the man interrupting the women in the meeting.
And this is so strong, it is something so universal, that there is data that shows that 75% of meetings are dominated by the male voice.
Women are interrupted two and a half times more than men normally in meetings.
So we thought: what will be the little punch that we can throw in this problem?
So we created this "app" here, which is on a device that is in everyone's hand, the cell phone.
It was released on March 8 this year.
The woman calibrates her own voice, then she turns on the device and leaves it on the table and over the course of a meeting or a session the app will automatically measure how many times that woman has been interrupted by male voices.
It's a tool... (Applause) It is a tool of very high precision.
And a lot of times people ask me like this: "Oh, but how does the app know if it's a man's voice or a woman's voice?
And if it's like that, Ana Carolina talking to Anderson Silva?"
(Laughter) "Does he know too?"
He knows.
Do you know why he knows?
Because it's a physical issue.
The morphology of the vocal cords of men and women are different so it is the level of volume that a female voice reaches that goes more or less up to 180Hz, even if it is a grave voice, and from 180Hz is a male voice, therefore, Anderson and Ana Carolina can talk that it will work.
Well, a super simple tool to use, in everyone's hand, that has received extraordinary global support.
These are posters promoting the app.
It was artists, men and women, from more than 80 countries, who spontaneously made these posters, which were the promotional pieces.
As you see, it's a male hand silencing a woman.
In addition, we have gained a lot of support from the media all over the world.
On U.S. free-to-air TV alone, our app has appeared four times.
In fact, in one of the programs the presenter used live, without her colleagues knowing, and she was interrupted 17 times.
And she showed it live on the air.
It's all there on our website, everything on YouTube, you can see everything there.
Also, thanks to a note that came out in the New York Times, we won this panel in Times Square.
For a month, we won free placement to promote the app in the United States, where the problem is very serious.
In fact, it was the place where the app had the most downloads.
Here too, the communication entrepreneurs of Brazil helped us a lot, also with media provided.
I found it very cool because both the owner of the panels in Times Square, as companies in Brazil dedicate spaces to non-profit companies and our app is free, has no profit purpose.
And finally, this "dashboard", which was our ultimate goal.
There are universities that have been studying this subject for some time and on Monday now, we will open the data of this "dashboard", these months of use, to these universities that already study the phenomenon, to the press and you will also be able to access; choose the countries, make the correlation.
And we will, firsthand, show you in a little while the first data of dissemination of this "dashboard".
But I wanted to draw your attention to the following: Brazilians should be very proud of a job like this because, according to the UN, there are 198 countries in the world.
Our app was downloaded on 154 and used on 145; on a planet where there are only ten countries led by women.
So, we should be proud of the reach and greatness that a small app has achieved, developed by Brazilian talent, entirely in Brazil.
So these are the first pieces of data that you're seeing firsthand; These are the countries where women have been most discontinued.
There are countries where women have been less interrupted.
People also always ask me, "But what about Brazil?"
Brazil is there halfway.
Monday you will enter there on the site and you will be able to check all the data of Brazil.
So those are our little punches for us to win this fight.
Did we knock out?
No.
But we're going to keep fighting so that one day things like this will disappear.
And we want to count on you.
Are we going to hack this problem?
(Applause) (Alive) Thanks.
(Applause) (Alive) Thanks.
Hi, my name is Gabriel Vilanova.
Today I came to present about the new cancer treatments.
New treatments can emerge at any time.
And monotherapy [is] the treatment that stimulates the immune system to fight the tumor.
The Zika virus is capable of killing irregular brain cells, and these cells are especially resistant to conventional treatments.
Immunotherapy is used in some treatments successfully.
The use of the Zika virus was tested only in rats and mice.
And the tumor was significantly reduced.
How to prevent?
It is important to maintain a healthy diet, rich in vitamins, in addition to not smoking, drinking alcoholic beverages, and avoiding radiation.
Success?
Yes, we have in these treatments.
The problem is the authorization of the Ministry of Health.
If this does not happen, the use of these drugs is prohibited.
But there is another treatment.
It's called friendship.
That year, in the first semester, I had cancer and was out of high school for the entire first semester, but I communicated with all my friends.
And that was the best treatment.
Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was little and I was in school, in what at the time was the first grade and today we call elementary school, I studied in a school of nuns in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul.
This school operated in a semi-boarding school system for poor girls.
So these girls paid a token tuition and attended school in full shift.
All the semi-inmate girls were black.
We studied together and grew up together, and I knew they were poor, but I didn't have, at the time, much of a sense of what that really meant.
Mariana, my best friend, was semi-internal, and in my mind, we were absolutely the same, entirely the same.
In fact, I couldn't understand why she could stay in school after class was over and I couldn't.
I also wanted to play with my friends and learn how to sew, iron, and clean, anyway, how they did.
This school of mine, unfortunately, only had elementary school.
So in high school, I had to change schools.
Because I left one of the cheapest and most diverse schools in my city and went to study at the best and most expensive school in Pelotas, most likely the most "white" as well.
In the entire school, I had two black classmates, and it wasn't until I realized this that I understood that Mariana and I lived in entirely different worlds.
We grew up together, but in reality, we never really had the same opportunities.
Well.
I left high school, graduated, entered a public university, graduated in psychology and went to do a master's degree.
During my master's degree, I spent four months living in Angola, where I developed research on education and the rights of children and adolescents.
When I was in Angola, on a beautiful night, I was talking to a researcher friend, also Brazilian, Cleia is her name, and I asked Cleia why she was in favor of racial quotas for access to higher education.
I remember Cleia took a deep breath and she began her explanation by saying, "Airi, the problem is that, in Brazil, poverty has color."
The conversation swept through the night, but that Cleia phrase kept hammering into my head.
I returned to Brazil, finished my master's degree, started my doctorate, and while I decided which topic to study in my doctorate, while I decided among the various possibilities of theme, the phrase of Cleia kept rumbling in my head: "In Brazil poverty has color."
I started to think a lot about my friend Mariana and, again, about how we were always together, but we never had the same possibilities.
It was then, with the insistence of this phrase of Cleia and the face of Mariana in my head, that I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, because, after all, if poverty has color, then prejudice needs to be studied.
Here I wanted to make a parenthesis only, with you, to explain that there is a difference between racial prejudice and racial discrimination.
So, in academic terminology, we use the term prejudice to talk about affective issues.
So, prejudice is related, for example, to liking or disliking a certain social group.
Discrimination is a behavior, it is treating someone differently because that person is part of a certain group.
So it would be, for example, to treat a person differently just because of the color of their skin.
So okay.
Closes parenthesis.
I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, and the next step, then, was to see how the psychology people are studying racial prejudice in Brazil.
And when I went to do this research, I discovered something that intrigued me a lot: I discovered that Brazilian researchers, when they study racial prejudice, have used mainly as an instrument, interviews and questionnaires.
This reason intrigued me because it is related to a very specific phenomenon, but to illustrate, I am going to ask you a question, and I want you to answer me in a very honest way.
Can it be?
Yes?
Can it be?
Endorsement.
So raise your arm, guys, please, whoever, here in this room, likes whites more than blacks.
No?
Nobody?
Wow, more than wonderful, huh!
Do you understand then why I was intrigued to discover that people were using, in Brazil, mainly interviews and questionnaires to study racial prejudice?
Personnel, interviews, and questionnaires are explicit measures of attitude.
Explicit measures of attitude are usually based on self-reports, they are measures of self-reporting, that is, people can deliberately control their responses, as you have done here.
So, this phenomenon that happened here in the room and that happens in the most varied researches is called "social desirability".
Social desirability is nothing more than the following: it is when the participant of a research answers not necessarily what he thinks or feels, but what he thinks the researcher wants to hear.
And social desirability, as I said, happens in the most varied researches, but especially in those that deal with slightly thornier topics, such as, for example, racial prejudice.
Just to give you an idea, if we used only interviews and questionnaires, only explicit measures, to study the development of racial prejudice in children, do you know that we would find it?
We would find that by the age of four or five, children respond to what they really feel.
So they would tell you if they like whites or blacks better.
By the time they are eight, nine years old, children learn that some things they cannot speak, that some things cannot be said.
So when I asked them that question, they would answer me exactly what you answered.
They would say, "No, I like everyone the same.
I don't prefer either whites or blacks, because, after all, we're all the same."
So if we put this on a graph, the development curve of explicit racial prejudice increases in the first years of life.
At a certain point, around the age of eight or nine, it decreases and then stabilizes.
At this point where it stabilizes, most people respond, "No, I don't prefer either.
I like everyone exactly the same way."
But do you think this data is really reliable?
Do you think I can get out of here in the room, get out of this TEDx, and say that nobody, none of these 100 people who are here in this room like whites more than blacks?
No, right?
I work in science.
I need data that is reliable.
But how to solve this problem, then?
How do you measure racial prejudice without having to ask people directly if they like whites more than blacks?
Fortunately, some researchers have been studying this topic for a while, for a few decades, and they have developed a way to study prejudice without having to ask people directly if they like whites more than blacks.
These measures they developed are called implicit measures of attitude, and they don't allow the participant to deliberately control their response, as happens when we ask them directly.
These implicit measures of attitude are based primarily on reaction time, which is the time it takes a person to push a button, or to issue a particular response.
One of the most widely used implicit measures worldwide is the Implicit Association Test, or IAT.
IAT is a super-simple categorization task.
It consists of the following: it is a task performed on the computer.
Then, we present the participant with a photo of a child and ask him to give the fastest answer he can.
So, in the first block, we present the photo of a child and the task of the participant is super simple: he needs to say if this is a white child or a black child.
So, to give that answer, he presses buttons.
You saw that up there are drawings of children.
It has a drawing of a white child and a drawing of a black child.
Then, he needs to press the corresponding button to issue his answer.
That's the first block.
In the second block, instead of seeing pictures of children, the person sees images that are positive or negative, and the scheme of the categories and buttons is exactly the same.
In the third block, the thing starts to get interesting, because now appear mixed images of children, photos of children, and images that are positive or negative.
See that we have, on each side of the screen, two categories.
Then, the participant uses the same button to give a different answer to two different categories.
The logic here, folks, is as follows: if the participant associates white people with positive characteristics, he will press the button faster to give me the answer when white and positive are on the same side of the screen, when we will use the same button for these two categories.
If two categories that he sees as opposite are on the same side of the screen, such as, for example, black and positive, and white and negative, as in the case of a prejudiced person, the participant will take a little longer to press the button because he will need to think about what the right answer is.
Folks, it's a matter of hundredths of a second, but it's enough.
So this reaction time measured by the IAT provides us with a measure of preference for one racial group or the other.
Better than asking people directly if they prefer white people or black people, don't you think?
I think.
So in my PhD, I decided that I wanted to study the development of implicit racial bias in children.
I know, you're going to say, or you must be thinking, that it's the family's fault; or rather, that it is the mother's fault; everyone thinks it's always the mother's fault.
But I'm a researcher, I'm a scientist, and I wanted to investigate this issue further.
So, I decided that I really wanted to study the development of implicit prejudice in children, which is a subject that is widely studied around the world, much studied internationally, but little studied in Brazil, and the studies are usually conducted with adult participants and using, as I told you, explicit measures of attitude.
You know that Brazil is a country with enormous racial diversity and continental dimensions.
So, what we decided to do was to study the development of prejudice in white, brown and black children from two cities with very different characteristics, both in terms of racial composition of the population and in terms of cultural characteristics, which are Porto Alegre, in Rio Grande do Sul, and Salvador, in Bahia.
Folks, the results that we found with our research, - we used two implicit measures of attitude and five explicit measures - were that they confirmed results of international studies, which say that regardless of the color of the child's skin, regardless of the color of the person's skin, in our case, regardless of whether the child is white,  brown or black, the levels of preference for whites over blacks are very high, and they do not change with age.
The levels of preference for whites over blacks do not change over the course of human development.
Here I wanted to return with you again to the fact that the person having a preference for whites over blacks does not necessarily cause him to present discriminatory behaviors towards blacks, because, as I told you, prejudice and discrimination are distinct concepts.
But do you understand how important this outcome is?
Do you understand how strong it is for me to say that, regardless of age, children already have high levels of preference for whites and that this does not change over the course of development?
If we were to put this on a graph, instead of having that explicit prejudice curve that I presented to you, in implicit prejudice we have this straight line, considering that age is down there.
So, folks, what this means, what these results mean to us, is that maybe it's not enough for us to keep saying, repeating to the kids that they need to like everyone the same way because we're all the same.
Of course, talking about racial equality is important, but more important than talking is putting it into practice.
So maybe what these results are telling us is that we need to turn our attention and our investments to fight racial discrimination, to combat discriminatory behaviors, which are, at the end of the day, what causes us to have such high social inequality.
And who knows, if we can reduce this inequality, maybe growing up in a world in which there is not so much difference between racial groups, so much social and economic difference, maybe growing up in a world in which one racial group is not so much more valued than the other, these children already start from an early age,  in the future, to present low, or almost zero, levels of preference for whites over blacks.
After I left that first school of mine, I never saw my friend Mariana again.
I don't know what end she took, and I confess to you that I blame myself so much for always having had all the opportunities she never had.
My doctoral thesis is an attempt to make sure that, in the future, other Marianas do not have their lives defined according to the color of their skin.
My thesis is an attempt to make science contribute to the understanding of prejudice and to the reduction of racial discrimination.
My thesis is an attempt to make us have the same opportunities in the future and that we are really all the same.
Thanks.
(Applause)
We don't know everything about nutrition.
But more than ignorance in this area, what exists is a lot of misinformation, a lot of noise and people who distort the scientific evidence, in the background to sell a certain message or, eventually, a certain product.
Today, my role is to try to help you demystify some of the arguments used in this area.
And for that, let's use Maria.
Maria was a happy, thin young woman who, unfortunately, got fat.
She got fat, because she got pregnant, because she had an illness because she worked too hard and didn't have time to take care of herself and became quite unhappy, with her self-esteem down.
One day I was watching television and the guru appeared.
These gurus go on television to present their fad diets, they have a very philosophical and appealing discourse but, usually, empty of content and full of logical fallacies such as, for example, the so-called fallacy of authority.
They love to say that the Nobel Prize of this, the Nobel Prize of that...
Basically, to validate your arguments.
We also have the fallacy of antiquity, that is, to say that a certain product is good because it was already used in the time of Hippocrates.
We have references or the fallacy of popularity, saying that "already thousands of people have lost weight with my diet", "I have sold hundreds of thousands of books", "I have a six-month waiting list for my appointment".
And they also love to use testimonies.
A lady who, for example, weighed 100 pounds and goes with the guru on television to testify that, in fact, she lost 40 pounds and became much thinner, that diet is spectacular.
The scientific validity of these arguments is zero, for us this does not work.
In the midst of this conversation, Mary fixated on this phrase: "Let medicine be your food and may food be your medicine" said by Hippocrates about 2500 years agoâ€”supposedly said by Hippocrates.
This sentence is a bit pernicious because it leads one to think that we can use food to cure diseases, isn't it?
In some circumstances, in fact, food can help us control some diseases and even some diseases stop having symptoms.
But then there are those who take this concept to the extreme and think they can treat autism, treat cancers, treat serious rheumatic diseases with food alone.
I don't mean that we health professionals don't value food.
Of course.
In fact, in 2015, an article was published in The Lancet with the aggregation of data from 188 countries, in which diet was placed first as a risk factor for premature death.
Therefore, food is important, there is no doubt about it.
What can we do to counter this data?
If you ask the audience, most of you know what it's like to eat healthy.
I don't understand why we have to constantly reinvent the wheel.
Everyone knows they have to eat more fruits, more vegetables, more whole grains and nuts.
Dairy in moderation, avoid red meats, processed meats and sugary drinks.
This is the basis.
The most important thing about this message is that in order to have a healthy diet, there is no single path.
There are several ways.
And, most importantly, it is not necessary to eliminate any food group.
Returning to the phrase "let medicine be your food and food be your medicine," already in the time of Hippocrates he clearly distinguished what was a medicine and what was a food.
There was no such confusion.
And someone took the trouble to read the Hippocratic Body, which are about 60 books written by Hippocrates and his disciples, and came to the conclusion that this phrase was never said by Hippocrates.
(Laughter) Therefore, if you want a phrase that is closer to reality I leave you my phrase: "Food is food... (Laughter) "... medicine is medicine."
(Applause) But poor Mary, you don't know any of this, do you?
And he consulted the guru.
The guru told him three things: "The energy balance is dead.
"With my diet I don't need to cut calories.
"The obesity epidemic was caused by international recommendations 'which recommended cutting back on fats'.
But when we look at the data, what do we observe?
We observed that the increase in obesity is practically superimable with the increase in calorie consumption.
Around the year 2000, there was a decrease in the consumption of carbohydrates and an increase in the consumption of fats.
And there was no change in obesity.
A calorie remains a calorie and the energy balance is in good health.
Anyway, Maria lost weight, even though she didn't realize it, she did caloric restriction.
Only, after a while, he got fat again.
This is very frequent.
Why?
We know that to lose weight, as long as there is calorie restriction, all diets are equally effective.
The most important thing is adherence to the diet.
What I tell people, usually, is to choose a diet that they feel comfortable with and that they can maintain for the long term.
When Maria gained weight, she became sad, with her self-esteem down, and went online.
With the Internet we have a serious problem because they follow the logic of "if I eat, then I am an expert in food".
(Laughter) And adding to that, reading some articles on Google, then we have Dr. Google.
These doctors are relatively problematic because they are people who have a low knowledge of the subject, in the scientific area, but have a perception of their knowledge that is much higher than what they really know and it is very difficult to talk to them.
This is called the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
What did Google's licensed doctors tell Maria?
"Mary, listen to what these gentlemen have to tell you.
"The nutritionist, the functional nutritionist, "the 'wellness coach', the orthomolecular nutritionist, 'the famous 'blogger' or 'vlogger' and the 'nutrichef'".
Which I add and what I call the alternative nutritionists.
Why do I have this designation?
Because what they usually say is.
Anyway, Maria didn't know this and consulted an alternative nutritionist.
He explained his shenanigans, he had lost weight, he had put on weight again, he was very unhappy, very down.
The nutritionist told her: "Look, let's do some food intolerance tests" to see which foods meet your profile the most, Mary.
We have two types of tests.
Laboratory tests, in which we measure the amount of antibodies that are in the blood and, supposedly, this tells us that the person is or is not intolerant to that food but, in reality, when there is presence of antibodies in the blood against certain foods, what tells us is that the person has been exposed to that food.
The Portuguese Society of Allergology and Immunology came to denounce these tests, said that they had no scientific basis and that asking for these tests was bad practice.
Then we have the famous Vega test that, by name, many people will not recognize, but it is those food intolerance tests done in pharmacies, in some clinics that can detect food intolerance to 700 or 800 foods.
These tests are based on the concept of energetic/bioresonance, that is, our body has a base vibration and, if there is a change, they can detect that the person is intolerant to a certain food.
We have known, at least since 1991, that these tests do not work, have no scientific validity, and yet continue to be carried out today.
This is not problematic because the mantras of alternative nutritionists are almost all the same.
"Milk is poison.
Gluten is poison."
"GMOs are poisons."
"Food is full of pesticides and toxics."
"We have to alkalize the body, eat organic foods, make dietary supplements, and do 'Detox.'"
Milk has been demonized recently and in fact there has been a decrease in milk consumption, but outside of people who are intolerant or allergic to milk, milk is a great food.
It's cheap, it's much more nutritious than the alternatives, it doesn't have antibiotics.
It has been shown to increase a decreased risk of childhood obesity, cardiovascular pathologies and diabetes.
It has no impact on overall mortality.
Then we have "gluten is poison."
In fact, there are people who have celiac disease.
But we don't even know if being gluten intolerant is a real pathology.
In fact, a recent study has shown that people can react, eventually, it is to fructanos that is a substance that also exists in cereals.
But this is still fairly early science.
What do we know relatively well?
It is that when people make a replacement of the gluten diet with gluten-free alternatives, it increases the risk of having diabetes, cardiovascular pathologies because the alternatives are worse.
Therefore, the person is trying to be healthy, and deep down, he will get sicker.
Then there's transgenics, genetically altered foods.
There will be no food that is put on the table that has not been genetically altered.
In fact, people habitually revolt against genetic manipulation that is more targeted and safer.
But this revolt in the population does not exist in the scientific community.
In the scientific community, we know that GMOs are safe and have fewer mycotoxins, that they are substances with carcinogenic potential, usually use fewer pesticides and have the halo effect, that is, even non-GMO crops on the periphery of transgenic crops need fewer pesticides, and are environmentally more beneficial because they can produce more food with fewer resources.
This discussion that we see sometimes about GMOs, for Western society is not very problematic because we have access to a lot of food.
But in underdeveloped countries it is a very serious problem.
The case of golden rice, which is rice enriched with vitamin A in which there is a great controversy because they do not want it to be put on the market.
But this golden rice has the potential to save thousands, hundreds of thousands of children from blindness and death.
Then there's the biological.
Things get a little complicated here.
Most people â€” surveys put it at about 95 percent â€” think organic foods don't use pesticides, which is wrong.
Organic food â€” or organic farming â€” uses pesticides but they are natural pesticides.
The problem is that the natural doesn't tell us whether it's healthier, whether it's safer, or less toxic.
In fact, there are pesticides used in organic farming such as copper sulfate, which are much more toxic than glyphosate.
And copper sulfate was approved shortly after glyphosate.
It went through the same process.
And no one has heard of a challenge to copper sulfate.
There is no study that demonstrates that eating organic food is safer and gives people more health.
There are some nutritional differences, in fact, but in terms of health, there are no studies that show advantages in eating organic.
In addition, another myth in this area is that organic farming is environmentally better.
The point is that if everyone ate organic food, we would have to use 20 to 25 percent more farmland, which would lead to major destruction of natural habitats and deforestation.
Therefore, as for the environmental impact, organic foods are not innocent.
In addition, they are more expensive â€“ about 70% â€“ and, as we have seen, without great advantages associated.
Then there's the fashion of alkalizing the body (Laughs) that, at the moment, everyone writes books about it.
This here is basic science, that is, the body has a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.
It is not possible to alkalize the body with food, nor is it desirable.
In fact, the body has several mechanisms exactly to prevent this from happening, be it the intestine, the lungs, the kidneys, or saliva.
Therefore, I don't want a more alkaline or more acidic body, because I know that when I have a more alkaline body, I will be extremely sick and possibly I will die.
(Laughter) So forget about alkalizing the body.
On dietary supplements, this is a multimillion-dollar market I think will reach 278 billion in 2024, and, as MarÃ§al said, with several problems.
It is not properly regulated has contaminated products, adulterated, do not respect the amount present on the label and, even if there were no such problems, that were all spectacular, in fact, most are useless, except in specific situations, for example, the issue of folic acid and iodine in pregnant women or iron in iron anemia.
Apart from these specific examples, they don't matter.
The funniest thing is the antioxidants.
In fact, antioxidants, a while ago, promised more health, prevented aging and then it was concluded that, after all, they increased mortality.
That is, people were spending money to die faster.
(Laughter) Then there are the famous "detox".
that come in every shape imaginable, teas, tablets, juices, enemas ecological washes, whatever you want.
But what one has to ask is: What toxics do these detoxifiers remove from the body?
And if they remove any toxic, how does it work?
Most detox methods fail to answer these two questions.
And even if you answer, we know that there are no controlled studies that demonstrate benefits in doing detoxification.
Therefore, Mary, at the end of this journey, came to the end uninformed, unhappy because she possibly cut back on some foods that she even liked to eat, and certainly poorer because she spent money on completely useless things.
Worse, Maria can come to an end with a psychological illness called orthorexia.
which is an obsession with eating healthy.
I call it a disease disguised as virtue.
The person spends many hours a day thinking about what he is going to eat begins to isolate himself socially because, in fact, he has quite severe dietary restrictions and, later, begins to have nutritional problems with avitaminoses, serious nutritional deficiencies that can lead to death.
Therefore, what I asked of you is that you do not be like Mary.
If you are chubby and want to lose weight look for someone who follows the scientific evidence and not the latest fad diet.
Look for someone who does food re-education someone who changes lifestyles.
Look for someone who will tell you directly that there are no shortcuts to achieving your goals.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hi, my name is Julia Coltacci, I'm ten years old and today I'm going to talk about recycling.
It is common to use plastic cups in schools, parks, malls, in various places.
Have you ever stopped to count how many glasses you use per day?
When you quench your thirst, the glass is no longer useful, and you throw it away.
Throw away?
Have you ever wondered where you're going?
From the point of view of the planet, there is no such thing as "throwing it away."
He's always going to be somewhere.
And where is it going?
It goes into the environment, polluting the soil, rivers and seas.
If you throw it on the ground, it is carried by the rains to rivers and seas, but if you throw it in the common garbage, which is organic waste, it goes to landfills, which are places where garbage is decomposed.
Starting to do simple things: swapping the plastic cup for a returnable bottle.
Some more tips to do on a daily basis: use your own returnable bottle, or biodegradable cups made of cassava starch, rice, sugarcane or paper; do not throw garbage on the ground and, when you throw in the garbage, throw in the right garbage.
To remind you sometimes, you can use the three Rs: "reduce," "reuse," and "recycle."
Reduce: consume without waste.
As I said, changing the plastic cup for the returnable bottle is already reducing.
Reuse: Reuse or create new objects.
And recycle: throw the product in the correct trash so that it is recycled.
Now, think with me: is the garbage man who generates the garbage or who removes it?
The employees who collect the city's garbage are not garbage men.
They are responsible for cleaning up the city.
When I use a disposable cup, it becomes mine.
So, it's my responsibility to dispose of it in the right garbage.
Do your part and throw the garbage in the right place.
And at the end of it all, what really makes the difference between a healthy, strong world and an entire polluted world?
We make a difference.
The attitude of each of us can change the world.
Thanks.
(Applause)
