When I was seven, I couldn't read, and all the girls in my living room could read.
So I kept charging myself and blaming myself because I wanted to learn like everyone else.
Oh my mother bought me several books that came with CDs and I kept listening to CD and I was following, because I could not read.
Anyway, I learned to read.
And when I learned to read, the whole world opened up to me.
I started dreaming things I thought I couldn't do but the books said, "You can!"
And one of those dreams was to do college.
No one in my family has a college degree.
But I believed I had to do university.
So I went there.
I have to do college.
I have to.
I said to my mother, “I have to do university.”
She went there, paid me a little course, with all the difficulties she had.
And I went to college at the age of 18.
In an extremely elitized course, which is Architecture and Urbanism, in one of the largest universities in the country.
And then I thought, "Wow, it's my happy ending!
I'm amazed, it's all set."
Except not.
The university is not a welcoming space for people like me, regardless of the course.
What determines the welcome you will get is your color.
And I was also a woman.
And I'd like to talk, talk a lot.
But not talk like that on a stage.
Use writing, and it bothers you.
So I started to feel bad in that space, and you're going to feel bad, you're going to feel bad, and when you see it, you're very sad.
And you're not sad one day, you're sad a month, a year.
You don't want to leave the house anymore.
And I didn't want to leave the house anymore.
I was depressed.
The peak of that was when I ended up in a hospital.
And then I was in a crisis, I couldn't talk.
I just wanted to cry.
I just wanted help.
And then that doctor looked at me and said, "You're depressed."
What now?
In 1996, I was three and my father left home.
And then my mother found herself alone, pregnant, and with a three-year-old daughter.
This is the story of many women.
Even many women like me, black.
And my mother, to deal with it, she wrote a letter to me.
I was three, I couldn’t read.
I told you that I learned well after everyone else.
But she wrote.
And then I understood that actually my mother had written that letter, which I went to read years later, because she wanted to deal with that pain.
And after a few years, my grandfather died.
And he was like a father to me.
And he was the first man in my grandmother's life, the only one.
The person she gave her life to.
And she misses it.
I miss it.
So... Every day my grandmother writes to him.
And I cry because it's daily, it's every day.
She opens a notebook and she writes, "Dear Daniel..." and she tells him her day.
And then... Years later I read a book that is called "Eviction Room", which is also a diary of a black, poor, favelad woman, who also had to take care of her children without a man present.
And she did it by picking up cardboard on the street.
And this woman, she says in the book, that when she gets nervous, when she can't handle everyday situations, she wrote.
And she would write on papers she would take in the trash And then, I needed help and I thought, "If all these women who are important in my life write, why can't I write?"
Then I started writing.
I wrote in diaries.
Then I started writing poetry, I started writing on social networks, then someone said: "Don't you want to write a text, on my blog?"
I said, "Ah!
Why not?"
Then I started writing on one blog, then another.
I wrote in a column here, something else there.
I started having thousands of followers, who were black women like me, who texted me and said, "What you write is about me, it's for me."
And I was like, "Guys!
That's much bigger than I imagined."
So that year, at the age of 23, I was invited by the largest publisher in the country to write a book.
(Applause) And I say that because writing is important to me.
Writing, as the writer Paulina Chiziane says, literature for her is the way she negotiates her dignity.
Writing is that for me.
So I'm here to try to say what I do to deal with the weaknesses that I can't have, because I'm a black woman, Society says that I have to be strong, that I can't come here and cry, that I can't go on my social network and say how hard it is to live without a father, for example.
Society says I have to hold everything on my back.
Society says I have to be strong, strong, strong.
I can't take it anymore.
I don't want to be strong anymore.
I want to be weak.
So I write, even to not feel so much guilt, to forgive myself.
I suggest you do this, because for me writing is a cure.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
My uncle came to Brasilia in 1972, carrying this suitcase here.
That was all he had.
And inside that bag, I had more books than clothes.
It's funny, but for his project, it made perfect sense, because he came to Brasilia with a very clear goal in his head: "I'm going to Brasilia to be able to study and win in life through studies."
That's why he brought so much book in the suitcase.
After he came, my whole family came too, and in this came my mother to make the same move as my uncle: "I'm going to Brasilia to study and make my career there."
This whole story happened before I was born.
When I was born, that bag was already here.
And the project of this suitcase was super right for both my uncle and my mother: they studied and won in life.
So, by the natural logic of things, a project that worked for my uncle and worked for my mother would work for me as well.
But when I went to school, I didn’t find myself in school, I didn’t get along.
And then, very early on, I started suffering from Sunday night syndrome, which was a desperate ghost that appeared on Sunday to say like this: "Oh, today is Monday and you'll have to do something you don't like to do.
You're going to have to carry a suitcase that you don't want to carry."
I have suffered from this syndrome almost my entire student life and much of my professional life as well.
For you to have an idea, out of every ten people, seven suffer from Sunday night syndrome.
You are likely to suffer from this syndrome as well.
And, if you suffer from this syndrome, it's because Monday you're doing something you don't like to do, carrying a suitcase you don't want to carry.
The first time I got rid of this syndrome was for the greatest luck in the world.
A teacher showed up at my school and she put everyone to do what she liked to do the most, and it was really cool because I started to enjoy Monday.
Only I grew up, entered the job market, became a publicist and, after a while, the syndrome bothered me again, only this time it was much worse, because I had an established career, I had a son to raise and had a lot of bills to pay.
I had the profession I wanted, the job I wanted, the salary I wanted, but I wasn't okay.
And the truth is this: no matter your profession, your job, your salary.
The truth is, if you suffer from the syndrome, it’s because you carry a suitcase you don’t want and you keep doing it because you have bills to pay.
I wanted you to stop and think a little bit there: what if you didn’t have bills to pay?
What would you do with your life?
There are people who are going to say, "Wow, I can't even stop to think about it.
I have so much bill to pay..." (Laughter) Or else, "No, I wouldn't do anything.
I was going to travel or watch Netflix all day, I don't know."
But think a little bit, really: would you want to spend your time and your energy doing what?
If the answer came in your head there, your way out is there.
You will stop suffering from Sunday night syndrome when you start putting this into practice.
And so if the answer didn't come in your head, if the answer didn't appear at that point, you need to find it because that's very serious.
Really, that's very serious.
It’s quite likely that when you find what you want to do with your life, you don’t know how to do it and maybe you want to take everything you have inside your suitcase at once and put it all at once too.
But that’s not how you’re going to make such an important change in your life.
We exchange what is inside our suitcase gradually.
For example, if you like photography, want to be a photographer, you need a camera in your bag.
Of course, you don’t need a whole photo studio.
You need to put the picture in your life.
If you like cooking, start testing some elaborate recipes with your friends, start doing it for free at first, start experimenting at first, put the cooking into your life.
When you least notice, your bag will be complete and full of things you’ve decided to carry, things you’ve chosen, things that make sense to you and that have use to other people as well.
My bag is light and easy to carry.
What I carry in this suitcase today is a project that I chose.
It's not a project of my uncle, a project of my mother, a project of advertising.
It's a project I've chosen, which is to help people figure out what they like to do and they can find ways to live from it.
On Sunday night, you will remember this talk that we are having today.
Maybe because you’re okay with Monday’s arrival; quiet because you’re doing something you like, or because Sunday night syndrome is bothering you.
If it's because of the syndrome, go pack your bag.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause) (Alive)

Good morning!
I was born premature in Rio de Janeiro.
My father had traveled to do the first international show, and he arrived there in Portugal, called Brazil and my mother was in the hospital, had had a detachment in the placenta and I was almost born.
He returned the same day, the show in Portugal was canceled, and I was born a month later.
(Laughter) It was the first time I went on the scene.
I grew up in this family of artists, very affectionate, very sincere.
My first attempt at the arts world was in ballet.
My mom put me in the school she was studying at in her youth.
It didn't last a month.
I liked the classes, but one day the teacher said the uniform was mandatory and I never came back.
My second attempt was on music.
I started studying piano... sorry, it wasn't piano.
I started studying sweet flute and singing, and soon after I entered a children's choir.
And I spent all my afternoons in music school, created a very strong bond with that space and with those people.
Then, one day, I had a presentation in a hall of a university here in Porto Alegre, with the choir, and for the first time I was going to be a soloist.
In a moment I sang the main voice alone.
I was always very shy, so singing in a huge auditorium didn't sound very comfortable.
And the music, until then, was a joke to me, and suddenly I found myself in a responsibility to the group.
Anyway, it was a lot of rehearsals, I was very nervous, but we did the presentation, everything worked out.
I was happy, a little relieved.
And then, I'm leaving the stage, happy and such, and came a lady in my direction, smiling, she stops in front of me, congratulates me and says: "Honey!
It couldn't be any different.
It's in the blood."
I didn't understand what she was telling me.
It was really weird.
What did she mean by that?
I didn't understand it as a compliment, really.
It was weird, but deep down it was a little frustrating.
She was referring to my father, who was a musician, or my mother who is also an artist.
Is it in the blood?
You mean I was born with that?
He has several studies in this area.
It has a research that was done in Canada by a Brazilian researcher, with 30 babies.
And some of those babies were exposed to a Maurice Ravel prelude for ten days, three times a day.
At the end of this process, all the babies were subjected to a test, and those who listened to the music at home during the week, paid more attention to it than in the other works.
That is, they developed a musical sensibility because they were exposed to music.
I was born into a very musical family.
He had piano at home, any birthday had a band in the room.
I also developed a musical sensitivity, but the environment in which we are inserted contributes to the development of our skills, our skills.
And I read a survey that was done in the United States, that when public schools had a short budget, they would take music aptitude tests to see who could attend music classes.
That is, the idea was to select those who had ease or genetic predispositions to music.
And they applied that same test to the instrumentalists of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which is a great orchestra.
And half of the musicians scored below average.
Half of the musicians.
That is, according to these tests, none of those musicians had genetic predispositions to do so, to work with it.
But they were there, and they're great instrumentalists in a big orchestra, it wasn't the blood that made them get there.
We have the record, we human beings have the biological record, the psychological and the imaginary.
And it has no prevalence of one record over the other.
We are the mooring of the three.
Today I understand the discomfort and frustration I had, when I was little.
I don't deny genetics, I don't deny the influence of the social environment before I've even been born.
But none of this would have made me a singer if it hadn't been my choice.
It's not just in the blood.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
In the month of May, it is turning eight years that I am inserted in this project, that I am dedicating everything I have.
But basically, I like to say that I’m dedicating half of my breath to this project that I’m going to tell you today, and that is giving results that we imagined should happen, only not with the speed that is happening.
Eight years ago, I was introduced to a disease that, until then, I did not know, and that it is quite likely that most of us all here do not know.
Even medical professionals know, but are not necessarily prepared or know how to act when it is identified.
I’m talking about sepsis, also commonly known as hospital infection or sepsemia, several other words that, when you don’t know, talk about it.
Even a Brazilian research institute did a survey last year and asked on the street if people knew what sepsis was.
Ninety percent of them thought it was a rock band.
(Laughter) This lack of knowledge is general.
Sepsis, since being identified as organic dysfunction, has already victimized more than 100 million people worldwide.
Sepsis is a disease that kills more than a traffic accident, not only in Brazil, but worldwide.
Every two minutes, sepsis kills one person around the world, and on May 28, 2010, sepsis killed my daughter.
On May 29, I needed to close a grave and I didn’t know what to do with all the love and with all the expectation I built on those 18 days she stayed with us.
Laura was born on May 10, 2010 and she changed the interface with me on May 28, 2010.
Since that day, I've been dedicating absolutely everything I have: my heritage, home, car... motorcycle.
That's the hardest part.
(Laughter) Everything.
Today I dedicate my whole life, all my energy; today I share this project with 25 people who are completely passionate about what we are doing.
Today Laura is deployed in a few dozen hospitals and transacting the data of millions of patients.
What she is doing in each of these hospitals is identifying which patient has sepsis.
I’ll explain a little more how it works, but I think that, first of all, you need to understand what is the limitation that exists in this context.
If we look at other diseases, other operational problems, they are related to organic triggers, biological triggers.
A person who has a heart problem automatically will have a heart failure, and that will trigger a protocol.
Sepsis doesn't have a biological trigger.
It simply gathers several factors that end up deteriorating the patient’s clinical situation, regardless of whether it is an ICU patient or a patient who is inside a bed in a normal ward.
He's in that risk.
In fact, any of us run the risk of having a sepsis at any time.
The difference of other diseases is that sepsis is completely controllable if it is seen on time.
If, in the time frame, professionals can make the necessary interventions, at least of sepsis the person does not die.
She will die perhaps from the comorbidities of her illness, she will die of other problems, but from sepse she does not die.
That's what we're doing.
I developed the world’s first risk-managing cognitive platform.
They are robots with artificial intelligence that connect to hospital databases, which connect to lab machines and remotely analyze this information hours in advance.
They make this traffic in a fraction of a second inside the hospital and can advance the risk of the person in approximately ten hours.
They indicate, of all the patients admitted to the hospital, which of them are at risk of sepsis, which of them are at risk of being in a clinical deterioration that will lead this person to sepsis.
Today, two years after we activated Laura...
The first hospital in which we activated the robot was on July 26, 2016, in a philanthropic hospital in Curitiba, in fact, the bravest of all, because the sisters had the courage, which many others did not have, to bring an innovative technology, an unknown technology, but a technology produced here, Brazilian, made with love, made with affection, made with attention, but which is cutting-edge, that leaves nothing to be desired for anyone.
They accepted that we activated this technology in Curitiba, and since then, Laura has already saved hundreds of people.
She identifies, more than ten hours in advance, who will have this problem.
In addition, she is transacting the data of millions of people, and all this with the sole aim of accelerating the diagnosis or prediction that this is happening.
We could treat this in many ways.
Technology in health is not new.
Artificial intelligence is not new.
But what’s behind this project is a simple word, it’s something related to what we all have and give for free: love.
I could have taken all that expectation of mine and put it on another platform, or I could have put it in other conditions or forgotten or treated grief in other ways.
But that's not the loss that has motivated me.
It is the love for Laura, and the promise I made to her, on May 29, that no one would forget her name in this era and that no mother would sleep anymore crying because of a totally controllable situation, is happening today, and soon, will help many more people all over the world.
So, impacting a billion lives is not difficult, as long as you don’t make your life restricted to pain or losses, you dedicate it to someone.
So, "go" save lives with us?
Thank you, guys.
(Applause) (Alive)
Rogério Martins is a professor and researcher in mathematics, at the Faculty of Science and Technology of Universidade Nova de Lisboa.
Bet on scientific dissemination to the general public, and is the author and host of the television program 'This is Mathematics'.
What would you like to reverse?
"The image of mathematics, of course."
(Applause) Rogério Martins: I'm a mathematician, and I want to talk about some of the reasons I fell in love with math.
Contrary to what many people think, I have never really been a brilliant student of mathematics.
In fact, when I was a high school student, I wasn't a brilliant student.
It wasn't that I wasn't interested in the subjects I was studying.
I was actually interested, and I always found all the areas passionate.
In fact, it's one of the things I want to talk to you about.
But the truth is, I didn't have a keen interest in getting good grades.
When I applied to college, I had several interests.
From economics to psychology, to biology.
But the truth is, I couldn't get into those courses, because I didn't have enough grades to get in.
And I ended up getting into math.
For good or ill, because I immediately fell in love with math.
I want to tell you, essentially, what led me to fall in love with math.
Suddenly, from average grades, enough to pass, I came to have one of the best averages of the course.
What made me fall in love with math?
I would say the first reason was when I realized that mathematics was about ideas.
In high school, I found math interesting, but there were a lot of accounts, I didn't understand what Big Picture was.
I'd say the bills are for math, how dribbling is for basketball.
In fact, we have to know how to dribble to play basketball.
But what's really beautiful is watching the game, watching the game happen, watching the throw back here.
See the strategy.
And it's exactly the same with the music, as we've seen before.
It is true that we have to practice scales, but what is beautiful is to listen to the complete work and enjoy it.
With mathematics is the same thing.
And I realized one day that, in fact, mathematics was much more about ideas than I thought.
It is much more a philosophy of life, than a set of disconnected and meaningless equations.
That was one of the reasons I fell in love with mathematics.
The second was that I realized I could get to a lot of things — a lot of those things I liked: biology, economics, sociology, all those things.
I could get there through math.
And that is in particular that I want to show you here, with a concrete example of my work in Mathematics.
It's true that I can't show equations, because they probably wouldn't realize them, but I can show something concrete, that has directly to do with what I do, and it's something I normally keep in mind when I study those equations.
The idea is this: Now I’m going to do an experiment.
I have two cans here, I have a board, which I'm going to put here on top of the cans, and here I have two metronomes.
The metronomes, I don't know if you know, are a device that serves to measure compasses.
Basically it's a watch that musicians use to measure times.
These metronomes are regulated for a certain frequency, in this case, 208 beats per minute – it is a must.
I'll put it in front.
Listen?
I have another metronome here.
In fact, these metronomes, although regulated to the same frequency, do not oscillate synchronized.
In fact, I have now dropped them here, but they tend not to have exactly the same frequency, although they are regulated for the same frequency.
What's curious, is that when I put them on this board, if I wait a little... ... something strange happens.
They interfere with each other.
I don’t know if it’s visible from there, but this board swings slightly, and they end up syncing — now they’re down.
This synchronization is not immediate, but after a while they end up synchronizing.
This is fantastic, because we humans synchronize often, when we play an instrument, or when we dance.
But that two inanimate objects can do this, in a way, communicate with each other and come to the conclusion of what pace they should follow, is indeed an impressive thing.
This phenomenon, which we are observing, is something that was discovered by Christiaan Huygens in the seventeenth century.
He discovered this by chance, by chance he had two metronomes on the same shelf.
Then it was forgotten for many years and recently, it was realized that it is a much more common phenomenon than was thought.
For example — I’m going to give several examples: In biology, it appears in fireflies.
Fireflies have a flash, and that flash is periodic.
Just as a metronome periodically swings, fireflies also lights up and turns off a light periodically, and interferes with neighbors.
And a fantastic thing happens in certain firefly communities: they synchronize movements and suddenly start adjusting the flashes, and, little by little, there are thousands of fireflies that synchronize their movement, as if each fireflie was one of these metronomes.
They synchronize their movement and emit a flash all at the same time.
This is a case of sync in biology.
There are also cases in the economy.
For example, the markets swing and each of them is as if it were also a metronome.
By oscillating they interfere with neighbors through trade, exports, etc.
Again, there is a phenomenon of synchronization that economists study.
Then we have, for example, the case of the power grid.
I don't know if you know, we have a chain called an alternating one.
The current swings in our house, in our take.
And when an electrical engineer needs to connect a power plant to the national power grid, he needs synchronization.
It needs the oscillation of the power plant to synchronize with the oscillation of the power grid.
Again, it is a phenomenon of synchronization.
In medicine there is a very curious case, where there are several phenomena of synchronization, a thing called the circadian cycle.
Next we'll have someone talking about neurobiology, here there's also a little bit of neurobiology.
In medicine, this circadian cycle is actually an organ that we have in our body.
We have a set of cells that marks the pace of the day, 24 hours.
It's basically the clock that makes us go to bed at the same time, or have the urge to eat at the same time.
That's what causes jet lag.
This clock is made of a set of cells, in which each of them interferes with the neighboring cell, and synchronizes the movement with the neighboring cell.
In fact, this set of cells is a phenomenon of synchronization.
There are thousands of cells that synchronize in oscillation with neighboring cells.
Here we have another phenomenon of synchronization.
Then our watch syncs with the day-and-night cycle.
Again, a phenomenon of synchonization.
Very curious because, in this second, our clock, our metronome, is still disturbed by the day-and-night cycle, but the day-and-night cycle is not disturbed by our watch, but there is still a phenomenon of synchronization here.
This to show you that this phenomenon, which appears in these metronomes, appears in many areas.
And what we mathematicians do...—actually we, myself in particular, don’t have a laboratory full of metronomes to do experiments, and boards, and cans, and such.
But I have a brain.
I have a brain and I have equations.
What we do, essentially, is extract the theoretical juice from these phenomena that happen in all these areas, and treat it mathematically, with equations, with mathematical tools.
That is the power of mathematics.
In fact, I would say that one of the phrases that best characterizes mathematics, was said by Poincaré.
He says that "Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things."
What is happening here, that is, when I mathematically study all these various phenomena, which occur in various areas of human knowledge, I am actually giving "the same name", the same mathematical name, to all these phenomena that, apparently, were different phenomena.
It was not realized that they had a relationship until a few years ago.
And that's what math does.
Mathematics creates bridges.
Poincaré himself says that the great advances in science occur when we can connect two things, apparently disconnected, and we realize that after all they have something in common.
Usually this connection is made by mathematics.
And that's what's fantastic.
I would say that mathematics, or doing mathematics, is leaving a comprehensive footprint — comprehensive because, when I work mathematically on a problem, like these of synchronization, which is what has occupied me for some time in the last few years, I’m working at the same time on all these problems, and hence the connection with the beginning of my lecture, in which I said I liked all areas.
I usually say even to my students, or to those people who are running for university, that if they like everything, maybe the best is mathematics, because in fact mathematics creates connections to everything.
Therefore, it is a footprint, I would say, comprehensive, permanent.
Permanent because it is permanent, mathematics has no time.
The Pythagoras Theorem has been as valid for two thousand years as it is today.
The math is either right or it's wrong.
If you're right, you're right, and you'll be like this forever.
If it is wrong, when much can be (unintelligible) and there is some mathematics that falls by the wayside, because it is not interesting enough.
Or because it's not used, because it didn't make it to the next generation.
But that is another matter.
That math was right, it's just not interesting.
Not all mathematics is interesting.
Finally, there is a fantastic feeling of working in mathematics, which is the feeling of walking a path that we realize is indeed unknown earth.
It's the feeling that we've come to a place that it was impossible for someone to not arrive one day.
This is mostly felt in mathematics.
It is very common for us to construct theories and realize that those theories are not the fruit of our imagination.
They were there, that is, a smart being from another planet, it would probably get to exactly the same place.
It would come to exactly the same conclusions — although eventually with a different language — but, say, the mathematical juice was there, that mathematical idea was there.
And that is, in fact, something else striking.
Another phrase I like a lot — this is a phrase that, for a long time, I had by my side on my desk and that is Pascal’s — says: “By space, the universe embraces me and swallows me like a point.
"By thought, it is I who embrace it."
This is, for me, the warrior's revenge, and once again it's the math.
When we feel small, physically, there is a certain comfort in thinking that, from a psychological point of view, our imagination, our thinking, is indeed great, and we manage to get practically everywhere through our thinking.
In a way, there's a certain revenge of our littleness here.
Finally, and to leave you a little to think, precisely with this thought that is comprehensive and powerful, I would like to show you the one who is perhaps the problem that will occupy me in the coming times.
Or in the next few years, maybe.
In fact, in sync, we can't understand everything.
There's still a lot to understand, even a lot.
In fact, in mathematics, it is very common for people to have the feeling that it is a somewhat crystallized science, that there is no research in mathematics anymore.
Actually, it's the exact opposite.
Mathematics is one of the most active areas these days.
One of the things that we do not realize is this: We have here these two metronomes, and we saw them oscillating, just now, in phase, that is, they oscillated the two to one side, the two to the other.
What's going on is Huygens didn't see this.
He had different metronomes, actually had big watches.
He saw the two swinging inward, and the two of them oscillating out.
And that's not exactly what we were seeing.
Now, it's possible that Huygens had water.
(Sound of the desynchronized metronomes) (Sound of the synchronized metronomes) Here you are, thank you very much.
(Applause)
What we know and what we already live make us who we are today.
Our questions, those to which we are seeking answers, will make us who we will be tomorrow.
Curiosity is what is behind these questions.
And curiosity is something I've discovered since I started doing research there in high school.
It just took some time and it took me to cross an ocean, literally, to understand the power of it.
During high school, I did research, studied at a school called the Liberato Foundation, which is relatively close to here.
There, doing scientific research is a true tradition, so all students do research.
From the first year in that school, I started doing scientific projects.
My first project, together with Viviane and Gabriela, two colleagues of the technical course, was there for 2007 and we heard a lot about global warming and the gases that caused greenhouse effect and we were very worried about it.
After all, did our school, the school activities we did there, contribute to global warming?
And then, we did our first project, which was to calculate mathematically and with a lot of data collection, how much our school emitted gas, carbon dioxide, during its school activities; and how much absorbed it, because inside the school there was a plantation of eucalyptus.
It was a mathematical account, it added up and subtracted there, and we found that the balance was positive.
The school absorbed more gas than it emitted, that was great for the environment.
We did this project, presented it at the science fairs... and we didn't get anything.
But, that's fine.
We went to the next stage, which was to do a new project.
Because of the eucalyptus plantations, we realized that nothing grew around the eucalyptus trees.
And then our second project was to create a natural herbicide with eucalyptus leaves.
What we did, basically, was to mix the leaves of eucalyptus with water, create an extract that could prevent the growth of weeds.
And then we went to a science fair again, showed this project and we didn't get anything.
But that’s okay, we were learning a lot from this process.
And then, in the third year, I was no longer obliged to do a project, but we liked it so much, to go to the fairs and not win anything, that it made a lot of sense to continue.
And then we wanted to do something more challenging, it was already our third project.
We decided to completely change the area, maybe the "zica" was because we were working with the environment, so we go to the health area.
And then we decided to create a dressing with nanoparticles.
For a family history, I already knew a little bit of the amputation process.
The idea was to create a dressing that could be used in the postoperative period of amputation and limb reimplantation.
Basically what we did was put in this tissue some nanoparticles that had antimicrobial effect, so they prevented bacteria and fungi from proliferating, and another that had thermal insulating effect, thus warming the skin and increasing blood flow.
Again, we went with this project to a fair.
And we didn't get anything.
But then we went to another one and started winning some awards.
A little of this experience took me to the fourth project, which is basically a continuation of that third.
After studying so much about the process of amputation and limb reimplantation, I realized that most of the amputations occurred in people with diabetes, usually in the lower limbs, because these people develop some typical problems, which we call diabetic foot.
And the idea was to use that same fabric to create a sock that could treat diabetic foot.
Because of these projects, I lived experiences that were amazing.
I started to win some awards and it taught me a lot.
But basically, let’s think about how these projects occur, how they come about, how scientists work.
And then I wanted you to close your eyes and think of a wonderful phase of your life.
That, puberty, can open the eyes.
Puberty is a wonderful phase, a chaos of physiology.
And in puberty, we use the scientific method a lot.
Imagine you there for 13 years when you looked in the mirror and suddenly noticed a red dot right in the middle of your forehead.
It was a pimple.
Scientists start right there, by observation and then they identify the problem.
That's definitely a problem.
Over the weekend you have a party and, damn, no one wants to take pimple at the party.
And then you leave for chance.
And your hypothesis may be that you can remove that spine using your hands.
And then the scientist goes to the next stage, which is the planning and execution of some experiment.
You go in front of the mirror and squeeze your spine.
And then we go to the result.
The result was terrible: his spine is now visible 10 meters away.
Before you arrive at the party, she will arrive beforehand and give "hi" to the crowd.
And then we go to the conclusion, which is the final stage.
But in fact, it never has an end, because always, in science, when you come to a conclusion it brings you many other questions.
Basically then, we start with the observation, and we encounter a problem.
Creates a hypothesis, plans and executes an experiment that brings results, a conclusion and new questions.
I learned a lot when I was doing research; but I had not yet learned what was most special and essential in being a scientist.
And it took me to go to Israel to see that.
In 2013, I was selected to go to Israel, for a five-week research exchange, at the Weizmann Institute, which is one of the largest research institutes in the world.
And I was there, in the middle of 80 more young people from all over the world, all about to enter university.
And I was put to work with my mentor, who was a neuroscientist named Hila Harris.
With her, what I was doing, basically, was trying to understand some brain functionalities.
I would always come to her and ask, "Hila, what you'll be able to solve when you understand what your project wants to unravel.
What problem will we solve?”
She said, "Kawoana, I don't know what it's going to be for."
I was so frustrated with it, because in my vast experience of a scientist throughout my high school, I thought scientists were people who used the scientific method to solve problems.
Actually, it was nothing like that.
At a dinner with the president of the institute, he told us that there in that institute the scientists were selected for their degree of curiosity.
Curiosity was the word.
It didn’t matter what his project would serve, what mattered was how motivated he was answering some question.
And I had never stopped to think that way.
I always thought what the projects I was doing would be for.
But when you work motivated by your curiosity, to answer some questions for which we still have no answer, you go beyond the frontiers of knowledge, because you were not predicting that result and usually the results that we do not foresee are great.
Thus, all too often, real problems are solved through the result of these researches that arose from the mere and genuine curiosity of scientists.
So curiosity seemed to be the key word of this process.
But it's not any curiosity.
It has a quote from Eça de Queiroz that says, "Curiosity is the instinct that leads some to look through the keyhole and others to discover America."
So that seemed to tell me that there were questions that deserved to be asked.
And it is about this look of scientist, about this curious look, that I would like to talk to you.
What questions do you want to answer?
And to rescue this look, you have to go back to being a child.
Children are always full of questions.
Where do babies come from?
After all why the blue sky, why do I have to sleep at this time and why do I have to go to the bath?
Children are always full of questions, but when we become adults we become full of certainties.
We think we know who we are and how the world works.
And we forget to ask questions.
And then we forget that to be a scientist is to want to break paradigms; to have a curiosity that is genuine and a will to change the world.
When we turn on the TV, open social networks, the newspaper, every day, what we look at is a world full of certainties, of facts: politicians in Brazil are corrupt, public health in Brazil does not work, and public education is terrible; you have to take care when you go out on the street because everything is so violent.
And we forget that certainty leaves us in our comfort zone and that it is in the questions that we grow.
If we were more of a scientist, if each one saw himself as a scientist, we would forget the certainties and ask questions.
How can I improve education in our country?
If I reduce social inequalities, can I interfere with urban violence?
So to be a scientist is to bring more questions to the game.
And it’s about these questions that I would like to share with you my current questions Because since I started doing research, I’ve started to be more restless.
I found that I could be the protagonist, and that of all these problems that we see in the newspaper, I could choose one, the one that maybe made my heart beat stronger and try to create a question, so trace an experiment, get to some result and maybe change a little of reality.
In this way a project called Beta Scientist emerged.
I did research throughout my high school, and after a while, I didn’t know much about what to do with that experience, that wasn’t just telling people that I had done it.
I have a father at home who always said that I had to write about it, tell the young people that they could live it, there were so many young people who didn't know they could do that.
Inside me had a question that made my heart sleep every day tight, which was what I can do with all that I lived.
Is it possible to transform the lives of other young people, as mine has been transformed?
Once you're a scientist, that you have a question, you have two choices: either you put it in the drawer and forget it, or you're going to do an experiment.
And so came an initiative that is called Beta Scientist, which connects young Brazilians with science.
What we do is, with a group of very engaged and very committed people, we connect the young people who are in high school to a scientific project.
We encourage these young people to look at the world with a curious look from a scientist.
We say they can be restless and no problem, that's great.
That those problems that they see in the world around them can be solved and that they can create a scientific project to propose some kind of solution.
What we do is offer a content on how to do research, mentors from all over the country who have done research and start to follow these young people, and challenges.
So I ended up somehow answering some of my questions.
That tight question now had an answer: yes.
Doing a scientific project during high school, having the gaze of a scientist, can change the lives of these young people and is changing the lives of young Brazilians.
I can see in the future, how much it can turn some of our reality into education, into our country.
How much these young people, more than creating projects, what we are creating are young people who create projects and create solutions.
Young people who are more protagonists and who see themselves as part not of the problem, but of the solution.
But since I am a scientist and for me what matters are the questions, the question that is inside me today is: what great are these young people still going to do?
How will they still surprise us?
And for you, I wanted to ask what is the question that moves you?
It's about having a new look, it's about our own existence.
What is the question that sleeps and wakes up with you every day?
Are you giving vent to this question, creating an experiment, that brings you some result a conclusion, and again new questions?
In 2010, after that succession of events of doing a project, going to pruma fair, not winning anything, doing another project, going to pruma fair and again not winning anything, there came a time when I left the scoreboard zero, which was to go pruma fair and not win anything, and then I managed to win a place in the largest science fair in the world, which happens in the United States.
And being there, representing my country, completely transformed my life.
And I remember that I was entering the fair, first time in the United States, first time at an international event, first time going to show what I was doing, for people who spoke another language.
And then I enter the fair and has a very large sign written: (English) "Welcome to tomorrow".
Welcome to tomorrow.
And then I understood that all my search for the answers, while I was doing projects, made me build a tomorrow that did not exist.
So what I can leave maybe is you think about what tomorrow you want to build.
Listen to the questions that are inside you.
For when we seek these answers, we build a future that does not yet exist and goes beyond the borders of what we know.
We create a better world, or at least we become better people.
After all, what we are and what we already live, what we know makes us who we are today.
And it is the questions, those to which we are incessantly seeking answers, that make us who we will be tomorrow.
Thank you very much.

I'm Rafa, I'm part of the rap group Rafuagi, and the message I'm leaving for you here today is that I believe in youth.
Does anyone believe in youth?
Do you believe in youth?
Audience: Yes!
Rafa Rafuagi: All this made me believe that, increasingly, the creative solutions to the problems of our country emerge from the peripheries.
They emerge from the knowledge of the Global South, and this Global South made me understand and participate in several collectives during my career.
There goes almost 20 years of hip hop, I started very early.
But in this, I could understand that, in fact, this knowledge of the Global South gave us the condition to create real impact projects within our communities, but, much more than that, transform to what we wish had happened, perhaps, when I was 15, and it did not happen, it came to happen now, when I was 30.
But this all made me understand that to believe in youths is also not just to look at our belly button.
And, yes, to look for the diversity that there is, especially in South America.
From there I met the Hip Hop al Parque Festival, which today is our great reference, and is currently the largest window of dialogue that exists in Latin America, especially with peripheral youth.
There are 100 thousand people a day at this festival in Bogotá, Colombia.
We were there in 2014, bringing this experience, and it made us understand the possibility that there is, not only within hip hop, but precisely in these forms of dialogue that we have.
In addition, another project that we bring as a reference is Commune 13, in Medellín, which made Medellín a reference in public policies, not only in Colombia, but mainly in South America as a whole.
In this, in 2012, I met a friend who is called Boaventura de Sousa Santos, is a sociologist, we have been working together ever since, and on that occasion, he asked me like this: "Look, Rafa.
If one day you could meet someone, who would that person be?”
Then I quoted, "Oh, professor, Jay-Z.
Exchange an idea with Jay-Z."
Then everyone laughed, "No, Rafa is there in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Jay-Z is there in Brooklyn, in New York..." And the professor: "There is a theory that we are five steps away from anyone in the world."
"What do you mean, Professor?
What kind of talk is that?"
Five steps: Rafa is friends with Boaventura, Boaventura is friends with Kenny West, Kenny West is friends with Jay-Z, I was three people away from Jay-Z.
Everyone was blown away, not that I was three people away from Jay-Z, much more for Boaventura being friends with Kenny West, they thought so... (Laughter) But that's okay, right?
What did he want to tell me in practice?
That things were not as impossible as they seemed, if we articulated in a network, collectively, together, truly.
Now, for that, we started to think: what can we join the boys, what will work?
In 2017, we created the Casa da Cultura Hip Hop de Esteio, the first in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the largest in Latin America.
It is 1.7 thousand m2 in space, and this house is in Esteio, and I already invite you to know.
There, in a year and a half more than 10 thousand young people have passed; we always do an account: considering the Brazilian family on average with four people, then there were more than 40 thousand people impacted directly or indirectly by ideas of solidarity and by the idea of a collective growth through the citizen and professional training that these young people receive.
In 2018, we then brought an idea that is the UPMS, which now in 2019 has materialized, the Popular University of Social Movements, which at this very moment is temporarily happening at the headquarters of the FMP, Fundação Escola Superior do Ministério Público, here in Porto Alegre, which seeks, through popular knowledge, to make emerge a new form of education within the academy, but, much more than that, this ecology of knowledge, as we are doing here today.
These projects are part of a tripod of projects in which we believe as a real transformative source of our communities.
The third is the Hip Hop Museum.
This museum does not exist yet, it will be created in 2022 in the Bronx, in the United States, but we are seeking this reference to also bring this experience to Brazil, precisely so that our memories, all these speeches that have passed through here and talked about memories, are eternalized and can, yes, inspire future generations, so that we can indeed have a much greater awareness as our self, but, much more than that, a respect and a society more just.
Through this, we can already see the result in practice, and this result goes beyond numbers.
And we say that this result generated engagement of people for all these causes, whether artists, like those who are here with me in the photo, such as Thaíde, Afrika Bambaataa, but so many other names that we can say that participated and actively participate in this collective construction.
But actors and actresses from organizations, such as the Public Ministry of Labor, through the allocation of TAC resources for the projects, be it the ILO, the International Labor Organization, which exclusively this year is turning 100, be it UN Women, through the He for She.
There are several actors and actresses who are involved, just understanding and understanding that these projects are strategically essential for the practical transformation that we need in our society.
With this, we see that this partnership agreement network refers us to a logical reasoning, which is what we believe, which is prevention.
I could give several examples of prevention here.
Can someone give me an example of what prevention is?
Is educating for diversity prevention?
Is giving equal conditions and opportunities prevention?
Is creating public policies prevention?
We believe that too.
We believe this and, because we believe it, we have sought to understand this larger system that, often, as the AD [Junior] brought, puts young black people incarcerated in bulk... And, for example, here in the Rio Grande do Sul Phase, there are currently 1,263 interns.
If we made a basic account, today each young person who is internal in the Phase costs the state of Rio Grande do Sul R$ 12 thousand per month.
If we made an account about a thousand young people, today these thousand young people, per year, would have the cost of R$ 144 million.
With R$ 144 million, we keep open, serving 4 thousand young people per year, 480 Houses of Hip Hop Culture.
This gives an audience contemplated by a public policy of 1 million and 920 thousand young people, which is configured almost 100% of the young population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
If we make that account of multiplying by four, of the family, there would be more than 7.6 million people impacted by a public inclusion policy.
It would be almost 100% of the population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
And Rio Grande do Sul, which, by the way, is the most racist state in Brazil.
But for this to happen, it is necessary that this comrade, this young man, when he leaves the Phase, does not reoffend, he does not return to the Phase, because in this way, too, he is feeding back the system.
And, in fact, this resource remains to be used, precisely, for that function.
But, much more than that, is to understand that when this young man leaves, it is necessary that our communities are prepared for this welcome.
Because going out and going back to the sameness, in fact, nothing will do.
And today, public policies are lacking, lack of respect, a number of things are lacking within the communities that, increasingly, unfortunately, keep these young people within the system.
Now, for this, we saw that all this result, and it is what I seek to share with you here today, about these results, in fact, in practice, they only happened because, in fact, there was engagement and there was a strategic network thinking.
Today we act in a logic of multiplication of three, which is precisely this exchange through the sharing of an information, an idea.
For example, we started a network with 100 people, and this network, the idea was: I learned one thing, I will pass it on to three other people.
Those three have learned, they will move on to six.
These six, for nine and so on.
In this account, if we multiplied these 100, with 3 gave 300, those 300 with 6 gave 1,800, 1,800 for 9 gave 16,200.
But that, in practice, happened and showed us what?
That today our South America has a population of 587 million people.
I speak exclusively of South America, being our country, obviously, Brazil, the largest country on our continent.
But if we had the possibility of dialogue with these people, how could we do that in practice?
We started to think that too.
And this logic of the multiplication of three, it came in good time, in that we managed to objectify more and more quickly this sharing of information, either with projects, or with examples, or with attitudes, or with any other way, for us to understand that, today, my great life goal, as well as my partners, who are running together, my partners also, is, in the next ten years, we dialogue with the half of the continent of South America, more than 300 peopletotally free from North American moorings, European moorings, but, much more than that, a continent that we can, in fact, say that this continent makes a difference in the world to the extent that people live with dignity.
And this, when I talk about dignity, is precisely that this mathematical account managed to send us, we are already arriving in a very expressive number, but I make a challenge for you: today you have heard many people, many ideas, many feelings, loaded with truth.
Who would be, for example, the three people you would get out of here and share what you heard or learned or enjoyed, today here?
Can you shout some people's names?
Who would be the three people?
Is it hard, like this?
Don't you have three people on your network?
The names, I want names, who are these people?
Scream there!
(Cries from the audience) José, Ana, Felipe, Tiago... (Screams) Bruna, Mari, João... All those people.
It is important that we understand that these people are also in the same struggle and often what is missing is information.
I often say that information is power, and truth is revolutionary.
Now, it is necessary for us to understand that, more and more, we have to start from the zone of theory to practice.
Problems are urgent.
The causes are emerging.
And in that, for every speech, you have to have an action.
For every action, you have to have a new idea.
So that we can truly see this transformation in practice, but, much more than that, be able to make new forms of resistance and new forms of project proposition emerge within the peripheries.
My mother said a sentence to me once, and I'm going to close it here with that phrase.
Unfortunately my mother couldn't be here today, but she'll definitely be watching me, and she says so to me: "Look, it's not enough that we're happy.
They must not be disgraced.”
And I'm going to look at that camera, because in a month I'm going to be a father and I'm going to say, "Augusto, it's for you, for you that I'm fighting and for all of us too."
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Alive)
So, I’ll start here by talking about a love letter from Ademar Bogo in which he talks about education.
He says more or less thus: that educating comes from the Latin "to take from within"; but matter and the elements for education all come to us from without.
These things when they are out, when they enter, they turn into consciousness and when they leave, they should at least turn into actions.
So taking is an illustrative gesture.
You take from within the consciences first what you seek.
Therefore, education has a valid function for all life, which is to awaken the sleeping actions and take from within us, actions of rebellion and restlessness so that we do not settle.
When I was invited to come and talk here about education, the first thing I did, was talk to a history teacher, my friend, and see some lectures about it.
In this, we realized how much is said about how the current model of education does not work.
But what is it to work?
And what do you want it to work out for?
One such high school reform explicitly wants it to work out for a training focused on the labor market.
Form cheap labor.
I, like the occupations, also think that the current model of education does not work, but our idea of working out is quite different.
For us, studying goes far beyond getting a job, making money to consume non-stop and continuing to sustain the structures of this system.
(Applause) (Vivas) We hope that education, that the relationship with knowledge, will be a means for us to discover about the world and discover about society, and not to reproduce it, but to consciously participate in its transformations.
But in the society in which we live, to want this is to be a danger, and increasingly, we see being treated with bombs and gags who is fighting for this kind of "dangerous" education; who cares about an education that helps to think, to problematize, and that uses the sciences to deconstruct prejudices, is suffering reprisal, is suffering persecution, and are having laws constituted against them.
Not that it is anything new the laws do not aim at a good for the working class, but they want to make it impossible for very important issues to be discussed in school.
School is an environment in which we spend a lot of time in our life, being there our first relationships with other individuals.
So, consequently, it should be there that we learn to deal with these other individuals and, above all, respect them within each individuality.
But so, in the occupations, when we talked about these issues of our daily lives, which were often debated, we respected all the thoughts, because we think and agree, that all people have different knowledge and none of these knowledges is more or less important than the other.
There was a guy who had been thinking that for a long time, and he is internationally recognized, but within this crazy juncture that we are living in, even he is being persecuted.
This guy is Paulo Freire, and he said... (Applause) that education doesn't change the world, education changes people, and people change the world.
He also thought that the student is not a deposit in which the teacher has to dump things, and he has to absorb everything.
He believed, just like me, that the student and the teacher have to work together and learn new possibilities, and discover new things in life; and he viewed education as a liberating pedagogy.
All of this may seem utopian, but I'm not alone, and occupations have shown me that.
Utopias are what help us walk, because even without knowing where we are going, they help us to move forward.
I wanted to dedicate this speech to everyone, everyone and "todes"... (Applause) that still walk and build this utopia together with me and that fight for an education, for a more just society, and that suffer reprisal for occupying the spaces they are trying to take away from us: to the people who fight.
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Alive)
What is a hacker?
A hacker is a person who is deeply dedicated to studying and modifying systems, devices, programs.
And thanks to this he manages to go beyond what is considered normal, within the standard functioning.
And he can even overcome barriers, which the creator himself thought were resolved.
There are no hackers just from evil.
There are hackers, for example, who work for the development of free software.
These people work in communities, in networks and they are usually driven by culture, ideology and motivations.
Culture, ideology and motivations.
So, inspired by this, I come to bring you today a proposal for us to "hack" life.
We hack that set of attitudes and prejudices that seem "normal", that were created by the system and that remain there.
I propose to hack life so that we can break prejudice and study whatever we want, work whatever you want, be whatever you want; create whatever you want, marry anyone you want, have sex with whoever you want.
Because if we live today in a world of such advanced technology, will we want to continue in a backward world of methodology?
Of course not!
And we women can mostly hack the macho software, in the neighborhood, in society, in schools, at home, at work.
If people stop to think about work, how often women do not come across aggressive men, who belittle their opinion, who interrupt them successively; interrupts once, twice, interrupts again and again and again.
So what we thought, me and my team in the agency, was that we could somehow help change that reality in the work environment.
Can we knock this problem out?
Maybe not, but we can throw a little punch.
Because sometimes a small screw prevents an airplane from flying.
And with small punches, a set of small punches, we can win a fight.
When I look at this data here, I keep thinking how hard the reality of the woman is, right?
These data here, even, remind me a lot of a phrase of Glauber Rocha that said the following: "The function of the prophet is to prophesy, not to get it right."
Far from me to say that the UN and McKinsey prophesied these numbers, they must have studied a lot to be able to see the trends and make this projection of numbers, but the phrase of the Glauber gains meaning from the moment that, knowing that the projected data is these, we should work harder and move forward to reduce the time in which this reality will be changed.
When I look at this data here, I keep wondering if people know there are reports and data that show that a work environment that has diversity is a more tolerant, fairer, more creative environment.
I wonder if people know that there are reports from the World Bank, the UN itself, McKinsey itself showing that in the environment where there is diversity, there is more productivity and, consequently, better results.
This directly impacts the outcome of the companies.
But why does prejudice insist so much on persisting?
So when we see these phrases here...
How many times have women not heard such things in their work environment?
Many.
Surely you know someone, or you yourself must have heard things like that in the workplace.
Isn't that true?
Well, we decided to study one of the phenomena related to prejudice against women in the work environment and that has to do with my area of activity that is communication.
So there are several phenomena of man's prejudice against woman and "manterrupting" is one of them.
The "manterrupting," is nothing more, than that persistent habit of the man interrupting women in the meeting.
And this is so strong, it is something so universal, that there are data that shows that 75% of the meetings are dominated by the male voice.
Women are interrupted two and a half times more than men normally in meetings.
So we thought: what will be the little punch that we can give in this problem?
So we created this "app" here, which is in a device that is in everyone's hand, the mobile phone.
It was released on March 8 this year.
The woman calibrates her own voice, then she turns on the device and leaves it on the table and throughout a meeting or a session the app will automatically measure how many times that woman has been interrupted by male voices.
It's a tool... (Applause) It is a very high precision tool.
And often people ask me like this: "Oh, but how does the app know if it's a man's voice or a woman's voice?
What if it's like that, Ana Carolina talking to Anderson Silva?"
(Laughter) "Does he know too?"
He knows.
You know why he knows?
Because it's a physical issue.
The morphology of the vocal cords of men and women are different so it is the level of volume that a female voice achieves that goes more or less up to 180Hz, even if it is a bass voice, and from 180Hz it is a male voice, so Anderson and Ana Carolina can talk that will work.
Well, a super simple tool to use, in everyone's hand, that has received extraordinary global support.
These here are posters of dissemination of the app.
It was artists, men and women, from more than 80 countries, who spontaneously made these posters, which were the pieces of dissemination.
As you see, it's a male hand shutting up a woman.
In addition, we have gained a very great support from the media around the world.
On American TV alone, our app has appeared four times.
Even in one of the programs the presenter used live, without her colleagues knowing, and she was interrupted 17 times.
And she showed it live on the air.
It's all there on our website, everything on YouTube, you can see everything there.
Also, thanks to a note that came out in the New York Times, we won that panel in Times Square.
For a month, we gained free service to promote the app in the United States, where the problem is very serious.
In fact, it was the place where the app had the most downloads.
Here too, Brazil's communication entrepreneurs have helped us a lot, also with media provided.
I found it very cool because both the owner of the Times Square panels, and the companies in Brazil dedicate spaces for non-profit companies and our app is free, has no profitable end.
And finally, this "dashboard," which was our ultimate goal.
There are universities that have been studying this subject for some time and on Monday now, we will open the data of this "dashboard", of these months of use, for these universities that already study the phenomenon, for the press and you will also be able to access; choose the countries, make the correlation.
And we will, first hand, show you in a little while the first data of dissemination of this "dashboard".
But I wanted to draw your attention to the next: Brazilians should be very proud of a work like this because, according to the UN, there are 198 countries in the world.
Our app was downloaded in 154 and used in 145; on a planet where there are only ten countries led by women.
So, we should be proud of the reach and grandeur that a small app has achieved, developed by Brazilian talent, entirely in Brazil.
So, these are the first data that you are seeing firsthand; of use of the app, these are the countries where women were most interrupted.
There are countries where women have been less disrupted.
People also always ask me, "But what about Brazil?"
Brazil is there halfway.
Monday you will enter the site and you will be able to check all the data from Brazil.
So those are our little punches for us to win this fight.
We gave a knockout?
No. No.
But we will keep fighting for someday things like this to disappear.
And we want to count on you.
Are we going to hack this problem?
(Applause) (Alive) Thank you.
(Applause) (Alive) Thank you.
Hi, my name is Gabriel Vilanova.
Today I came to introduce you about the new cancer treatments.
New treatments can come up at any time.
And monotherapy [is] the treatment that stimulates the immune system to fight the tumor.
Zika virus is capable of killing irregular brain cells, and these cells are especially resistant to conventional treatments.
Immunotherapy is used in some treatments successfully.
Zika virus use has been tested only in mice and mice.
And the tumor was significantly reduced.
How to prevent?
It is important to maintain a healthy diet, rich in vitamins, in addition to not smoking, drinking alcohol, and avoid radiation.
Success?
Yes, we have in these treatments.
The problem is the authorization of the Ministry of Health.
If this does not happen, the use of these drugs is prohibited.
But there is another treatment.
He's called friendship.
That year, in the first semester, I had cancer and stayed the entire first semester out of high school, but I communicated with all the friends.
And that was the best treatment.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was little and I was in school, in what at the time was the first degree and today we call it elementary school, I studied in a school of nuns in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul.
This school worked in a semi-internship system for poor girls.
So these girls paid a symbolic tuition and attended full-time school.
All the semi-internal girls were black.
We studied together and grew up together, and I knew they were poor, but I didn’t have, at the time, much sense of what that actually meant.
Mariana, my best friend, was semi-internal, and in my head, we were absolutely equal, entirely equal.
I even couldn't understand why she could stay in school after she finished class and I couldn't.
I also wanted to play with my friends and learn to sew, pass and clean, finally, as they did.
This school of mine, unfortunately, only had elementary school.
So in high school, I had to change school.
Because I left one of the cheapest and most diverse schools in my city and went to study in the best and most expensive school in Pelotas, most likely the most "white" as well.
In school, I had two black classmates, and it was only when I realized that I understood that Mariana and I lived in entirely different worlds.
We grew up together, but in reality we never really had the same opportunities.
Well, well.
I left high school, graduated, went to a public university, graduated in psychology and went to do a master’s degree.
During the master’s degree, I spent four months living in Angola, where I developed a research on education and rights of children and adolescents.
When I was in Angola, on a beautiful night, I talked with a research friend, also Brazilian, Cleia is her name, and I asked Cleia why she was favorable to the racial quotas of access to higher education.
I remember that Cleia took a deep breath and she began her explanation by saying: "Airi, the problem is that in Brazil, poverty has color."
The conversation swept into the night, but that phrase from Cleia was hammered in my head.
I returned to Brazil, finished the master's degree, started the doctorate, and while I decided what topic to study in my doctorate, while I decided among the various possibilities of theme, the phrase of Cleia kept resounding in my head: "In Brazil poverty has color."
I started to think a lot about my friend Mariana and again, how we have always been together, but we have never had the same possibilities.
It was then that, with the insistence of this phrase of the Cleia and the face of Mariana in my head, that I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, because, after all, if poverty has color, then prejudice needs to be studied.
Here I wanted to make a parenthesis only, with you, to explain that there is a difference between racial prejudice and racial discrimination.
So, in academic terminology, we use the term prejudice to talk about affective issues.
So prejudice is related, for example, to liking or disliking a particular social group.
Discrimination is a behavior, it is treating someone differently because that person is part of a certain group.
So it would be, for example, treating a person differently just because of the color of their skin.
So it is.
Closes parenthesis.
I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, and the next step, so it was to see how the psychology people are studying racial prejudice in Brazil.
And when I went to do this research, I discovered one thing that intrigued me a lot: I found that Brazilian researchers, when they study racial prejudice, have mainly used, as an instrument, interviews and questionnaires.
This reason intrigued me because it is related to a very specific phenomenon, but to exemplify, I will ask you a question, and I want you to answer me very honestly.
Could it be?
Yeah, yeah?
Could it be?
Okay. Okay.
So, raise your arm, guys, please, who, here in this room, likes whites more than blacks.
No?
Nobody?
Wow, more than wonderful, huh!
Do you understand why I was intrigued to discover that people were using, in Brazil, mainly interviews and questionnaires to study racial prejudice?
Staff, interviews and questionnaires are explicit measures of attitude.
Explicit attitude measures are usually self-report-based, they are self-report measures, that is, people can deliberately control your answers, as you have done here.
So, this phenomenon that happened here in the room and that happens in the most varied searches is called "social desirability".
Social desirability is nothing more than the following: it is when the participant in a survey responds not necessarily what he thinks or feels, but what he thinks the researcher wants to hear.
And social desirability, as I said, happens in the most varied researches, but especially in those that deal with slightly thornier topics, such as, for example, racial prejudice.
Just for you to have an idea, if we used only interviews and questionnaires, only explicit measures, to study the development of racial prejudice in children, do you know that we would find?
We would find that, by the age of four or five, children respond to what they really feel.
So they would tell you if they like white or black more.
There by the age of eight, nine, children learn that some things they cannot talk about, that some things cannot be said.
So when I asked them that question, they would answer me exactly what you answered.
They would say, "No, I like everyone the same.
I prefer neither white nor blacks, because after all, we are all the same.”
So if we put that on a chart, the explicit racial prejudice development curve increases in the first few years of life.
At a certain point, by the age of eight or nine, she decreases and then stabilizes.
At that point where she stabilizes, most people respond: "No, I prefer neither one nor the other.
I like everyone in exactly the same way.”
But do you think this data is really reliable?
Do you think I can leave this room, get out of this TEDx, and say that no one of these 100 people who are here in this room likes whites more than blacks?
No, right?
I work with science.
I need data that is reliable.
How do you solve this problem?
How to measure racial prejudice without having to ask people directly if they like whites more than blacks?
Fortunately, some researchers have been studying this topic for a while, a few decades ago, and they have developed a way to study prejudice without having to ask people directly if they like whites more than blacks.
These measures that they have developed are called implicit measures of attitude, and they do not allow the participant to deliberately control their answer, as happens when we ask him directly.
These implicit attitude measures are based primarily on reaction time, which is the time it takes for the person to push a button, or to issue a certain response.
One of the most widely used implicit measures around the world is the Implicit Association Test, or IAT.
IAT is a supersimple categorization task.
It consists of the following: it is a task performed on the computer.
So, we present to the participant the photo of a child and ask him to give the quickest answer that he can.
So, in the first block, we present the photo of a child and the task of the participant is supersimple: he needs to say if this is a white child or a black child.
So, to give that answer, it pushes buttons.
You saw that up there has drawings of children.
It has a drawing of a white child and a drawing of a black child.
So, it needs to press the corresponding button to issue your answer.
This is the first block.
In the second block, instead of seeing pictures of children, the person sees images that are positive or negative, and the scheme of the categories and buttons is exactly the same.
In the third block, the thing starts to get interesting, because now appear mixed images of children, photos of children, and images that are positive or negative.
See that we have, on each side of the screen, two categories.
Then, the participant uses the same button to give a different answer to two distinct categories.
The logic here, folks, is this: if the participant associates white people with positive characteristics, he will press the button faster to give me the answer when white and positive are on the same side of the screen, when we use the same button for these two categories.
If two categories he sees as opposites are on the same side of the screen, such as, for example, black and positive, and white and negative, as in the case of a prejudiced person, the participant will take a little longer to press the button because he will need to think what the right answer is.
Guys, it's a matter of hundredths of a second, but that's enough.
So, this reaction time measured by IAT provides us with a measure of preference for one racial group or the other.
Better than asking people straight whether they prefer white people or black people, don’t you think?
I think.
So, in my PhD, I decided that I wanted to study the development of implicit racial prejudice in children.
I know, you're going to say, or you must be thinking, that it's the family's fault; or rather, it's the mother's fault; everyone thinks it's always the mother's fault.
But I'm a researcher, I'm a scientist, and I wanted to further investigate this issue.
So, I decided that I really wanted to study the development of implicit prejudice in children, which is a very studied topic around the world, much studied internationally, but little studied in Brazil, and the studies are usually conducted with adult participants and using, as I said to you, explicit measures of attitude.
You know that Brazil is a country with a huge racial diversity and continental dimensions.
So, what we decided to do was to study the development of prejudice in white, brown and black children of two cities with very different characteristics, both in terms of racial composition of the population and in terms of cultural characteristics, which are Porto Alegre, in Rio Grande do Sul, and Salvador, in Bahia.
Guys, the results that we found with our research, - we used two implicit measures of attitude and five explicit measures - were that they confirmed results of the international studies, which say that regardless of the color of the skin of the child, regardless of the color of the skin of the person, in our case, regardless of whether the child is white, brown or black, the levels of preference for whites in relation to blacks are very high, and they do not change with age.
Preference levels for whites relative to blacks do not change throughout human development.
Here I wanted to resume with you again the fact that the person has a preference for whites in relation to blacks does not necessarily make him present discriminatory behaviors towards blacks, because, as I said to you, prejudice and discrimination are distinct concepts.
But do you understand how important this outcome is?
Do you understand how strong it is for me to say that, regardless of age, children already have high levels of preference for whites and that this does not change throughout development?
If we were to put this in a graph, instead of us having that curve of explicit prejudice that I presented to you, in the implicit prejudice we have this straight line, considering that the age is down there.
So, guys, what that means, what these results mean to us, is that maybe it’s not enough for us to keep saying, repeating to the children that they need to like everyone the same way because we’re all the same.
Of course, talking about racial equality is important, but more important than talking is putting it into practice.
So perhaps what these results are telling us is that we need to turn our attention and our investments to combat racial discrimination, to combat discriminatory behaviors, which are, in the end, what makes us have such a high social inequality.
And who knows so, if we can reduce this inequality, perhaps by growing in a world in which there is not so much difference between racial groups, so much social and economic difference, who knows how to grow in a world in which one racial group is not so much more valued than the other, these children already start from an early age, in the future, to present low, or almost zero, levels, preferably for whites in relation to blacks.
After I left my first school, I never saw my friend Mariana again.
I don't know what end she took, and I confess to you that I blame myself so much for always having had every opportunity she never had.
My doctoral thesis is an attempt to make other Marianas not have their lives defined according to the color of their skin.
My thesis is an attempt to make science contribute to the understanding of prejudice and to the decrease of racial discrimination.
My thesis is an attempt to make the same opportunities in the future and that we are, then, really all the same.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
We don't know everything about nutrition.
But more than ignorance in this area, what exists is a lot of misinformation, a lot of noise and people who distort the scientific evidence, in the background to sell a certain message or, eventually, a certain product.
Today, my role is to try to help you demystify some arguments used in this area.
And for that, we're going to use Maria.
Maria was a happy, thin young woman who unfortunately put on weight.
He got fat, because he got pregnant, because he had a disease because he worked too hard and didn’t have time to take care of himself and was quite unhappy, with his self-esteem down.
One day I was watching the television and the guru showed up.
These gurus go on television to present their fad diets, have a very philosophical and appealing discourse but usually empty of content and full of logical fallacies such as, for example, the so-called fallacy of authority.
They love to say that the Nobel Prize for this, the Nobel Prize for that...
Basically, to validate your arguments.
We also have the fallacy of antiquity, that is, to say that a certain product is good because it was already used in the time of Hippocrates.
We have references or the fallacy of popularity, saying that "already thousands of people have lost weight with my diet," "I've sold hundreds of thousands of books," "I have a six-month waiting list for my consultation."
They also love to use testimonials.
A lady who, for example, weighed 100 kilos and goes with the guru to television to testify that, in fact, she lost 40 kilos and became much thinner, that diet is spectacular.
The scientific validity of these arguments is zero, for us this is not good.
In the midst of this conversation, Mary settled in this sentence: "May the medicine be your food and may food be your medicine" said by Hippocrates about 2500 years ago - supposedly said by Hippocrates.
This phrase is a little pernicious because it leads us to think that we can use food to cure diseases, isn't it?
In some circumstances, in fact, food can help us to control some diseases and even some diseases to stop having symptoms.
But then, there are those who take this concept to the extreme and think that it can treat autism, treat cancers, treat serious rheumatological diseases only with food.
I don't mean that we health professionals don't value food.
Obviously, yes.
In fact, in 2015, an article was published in The Lancet with the aggregation of data from 188 countries, in which food was placed first as a risk factor for premature death.
Therefore, food is important, there is no doubt about it.
What can we do to counteract this data?
If you ask the audience, most of you know what it's like to eat healthy.
I don't understand why we have to constantly reinvent the wheel.
Everyone knows that they have to eat more fruit, more vegetables, more whole grains and nuts.
Dairy in moderation, avoid red meats, processed meats and sugary drinks.
This is the base.
The most important thing about this message is that in order to have a healthy diet, there is no single path.
There are several paths.
And most importantly, it is not necessary to eliminate any food group.
Returning to the phrase "let the medicine be your food and the food be your medicine", already in the time of Hippocrates he clearly distinguished what was a medicine and what was a food.
There was no such mess.
And one gave himself the trouble of reading the Hippocratic Corps, which are about 60 books written by Hippocrates and his disciples, and came to the conclusion that this sentence was never said by Hippocrates.
(Laughter) So if you want a phrase that comes closer to reality I leave you my phrase: "Food is food... (Laughter) "... medicine is medicine."
(Applause) But poor Mary doesn't know any of this, does she?
And he consulted the guru.
The guru said to him three things: "The energy balance is dead.
“With my diet you don’t need to cut calories.
"The obesity epidemic was caused by international recommendations "that recommended cutting back on fats."
But when we look at the data, what do we observe?
We observed that the increase in obesity is practically overlying the increase in calorie consumption.
Around the year 2000, there was a decrease in carbohydrate consumption and an increase in fat consumption.
There was no change in obesity.
A calorie remains a calorie and the energy balance is well in health.
Anyway, Maria lost weight, even though she didn't realize it, made calorie restriction.
Only, after a while, he got fat again.
This is very frequent.
Why?
We know that to lose weight, as long as there is caloric restriction, all diets are equally effective.
The most important thing is to adhere to the diet.
What I tell people, usually, is that they choose a diet that they feel comfortable with and that they can maintain in the long run.
When Maria got fat, she was sad, with her self-esteem down and went to the Internet.
With the Internet we have a serious problem because they follow the logic of "if I eat, I'm a food expert" logic.
(Laughter) And adding to that, read some articles on Google, so we got the Dr. Google.
These doctors are relatively problematic because they are people who have a low knowledge of the subject, in the scientific area, but have a perception of their knowledge that is much superior to what they really know and it is very difficult to talk to them.
This is called the Dunning-Kruger Effect.
What did the licensed doctors on Google say to Maria?
"Mary, listen to what these gentlemen have to say to you.
"The nutrilogist, the functional nutritionist, "the 'wellness coach', the orthomolecular nutritionist, "the famous 'blogger' or 'vlogger' and the 'nutrichef'."
That I aggregate and what I call alternative nutritionists.
Why do I have this designation?
Because what they say is bullshit.
Anyway, Maria didn't know this and consulted an alternative nutritionist.
He explained his adventures, he had slimmed down, he had become fat again he was very unhappy, very much down.
The nutritionist told him: "Look, let's do some food intolerance tests "to understand which foods go more against your profile, Maria."
We have two types of tests.
Laboratory tests, in which we measure the amount of antibodies in the blood and, supposedly, this tells us that the person is or is not intolerant to that food but, in reality, when there is presence of antibodies in the blood against certain foods, what tells us is that the person has been exposed to that food.
The Portuguese Society of Allergology and Immunology came to denounce these exams, said that they had no scientific basis and that asking for these exams was bad practice.
Then we have the famous Vega test that, by name, many people will not recognize, but it is those tests of food intolerance done in pharmacies, in some clinics that can detect food intolerance at 700 or 800 foods.
These tests are based on the concept of energy/bioresonance, that is, our body has a base vibration and, if there is a change, they can detect that the person is intolerant to a certain food.
We know, at least since 1991, that these tests do not work, they have no scientific validity and yet continue to be carried out today.
This is not problematic because the mantras of alternative nutritionists are almost all the same.
"The milk is poison.
Gluten is poison.”
“Transgenics are poisons.”
“Food is full of pesticides and toxics.”
"We have to alkalize the body, "eat organic foods, "make dietary supplements "and make 'Detox'."
Milk has been demonized recently and, in fact, there has been a decrease in milk consumption but, apart from people who are intolerant or allergic to milk, milk is a great food.
It's cheap, it's much more nutritious than the alternatives, it doesn't have antibiotics.
It has been shown to increase a decrease in the risk of childhood obesity, cardiovascular pathologies and diabetes.
It has no impact on overall mortality.
Then we have "gluten is poison."
In fact, there are people who have celiac disease.
But we don’t even know if being gluten intolerant is a real pathology.
In fact, a recent study has shown that people can react, eventually, it is to the fructanes that it is a substance that also exists in cereals.
But this is still pretty early science.
What do we know relatively well?
It is that when people make a replacement of the gluten diet with gluten-free alternatives, it increases the risk of having diabetes, cardiovascular pathologies because the alternatives are worse.
So the person is trying to be healthy, and deep down, they're going to get sicker.
Then we have the transgenics, genetically altered foods.
There will be no food that is placed on the table that has not been genetically altered.
In fact, people usually revolt against genetic manipulation that is more targeted and safer.
But this revolt in the population does not exist in the scientific community.
In the scientific community, we know that transgenics are safe have fewer mycotoxins, which are substances with carcinogenic potential, usually use fewer pesticides and have the effect of halo, that is, even non-transgenic crops on the periphery of transgenic crops need fewer pesticides, and are environmentally more beneficial because they can produce more food with fewer resources.
This discussion that we sometimes see about transgenics, for Western society is not very problematic because we have access to many foods.
But in the underdeveloped countries it is a very serious problem.
The case of golden rice, which is a rice enriched with vitamin A in which there is a great controversy because they do not want it to be put on the market.
But this golden rice has a potential to save thousands, hundreds of thousands of children from blindness and death.
Then we have the biological.
Things get a little complicated here.
Most people — there are surveys that point to about 95% — think organic food doesn’t use pesticides which is wrong.
Organic foods — or organic farming — use pesticides but are natural pesticides.
The problem is that the natural doesn’t tell us if it’s healthier, if it’s safer or less toxic.
In fact, there are pesticides used in organic farming, such as copper sulfate, which are much more toxic than glyphosate.
And copper sulfate was approved shortly after glyphosate.
It went through the same process.
And no one has heard of contestation to the copper sulfate.
There is no study that demonstrates that eating organic food is safer and gives people more health.
There are some nutritional differences, in fact, but in terms of health, there are no studies that show advantages in eating biological.
In addition, another myth in this area is to think that organic farming is environmentally better.
The point is that if everyone ate organic food, we would have to use 20 to 25% more cultivation land which would lead to a great destruction of natural habitats and deforestation.
Therefore, as for the environmental impact, organic food is not innocent.
In addition, they are more expensive — about 70% — and, as we have seen, without major associated advantages.
Then we have the fashion of alkalizing the body (Laughter) that, right now, everyone writes books about this.
This here is basic science, meaning the body has a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.
It is not possible to alkalize the body with food, nor is it desirable.
In fact, the body has several mechanisms exactly to prevent this from happening, be it the intestine, the lungs, the kidneys, or saliva.
Therefore, I do not want a more alkaline body or more acidic, because I know that when I have a more alkaline body, I will be extremely sick and possibly die.
(Laughter) So forget about alkalizing the body.
About food supplements, this is a multi-million dollar market I think will reach 278 billion in 2024, and, as Marçal said, with several problems.
It is not properly regulated it has contaminated, adulterated products, do not respect the amount present on the label and, even if there were no such problems, that were all spectacular, in fact, most are useless, except in specific situations, for example, the issue of folic acid and iodine in pregnant women or iron in ferropenic anemia.
Other than these specific examples, they don't matter.
The funniest thing is antioxidants.
In fact, antioxidants, a while ago, promised more health, prevented aging and then it was concluded that, after all, they increased mortality.
That is, people were spending money to die faster.
(Laughter) Then we have the famous "detox."
that come in every way imaginable, teas, tablets, juices, ecological maneuns, whatever you want.
But what you have to ask is: What toxics do these detoxifiers take from the body?
And if they take out any toxics, how does it work?
Most detoxification methods cannot answer these two questions.
And even if you answer, we know that there are no controlled studies that show benefits in detoxifying.
Therefore, Mary, at the end of this walk, came to the end uninformed, unhappy because, possibly, she cut into some foods that she even liked to eat, and certainly poorer because she spent money on completely useless things.
Worse, Maria may come to an end with a psychological illness called orthoresy.
It is an obsession with eating healthy.
I call it a disease disguised as virtue.
The person spends many hours a day thinking about what he is going to eat begins to isolate himself socially because, in fact, he has very marked dietary restrictions and, later, begins to have nutritional problems with avitaminosis, severe nutritional deficiencies that can lead to death.
Therefore, what I asked you is that you not be like Mary.
If you are chubbier and want to lose weight look for someone who follows the scientific evidence and not the last fad diet.
Look for someone who does food re-education someone who alters lifestyles.
Look for someone who tells you directly that there are no shortcuts to achieving your goals.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hi, my name is Julia Coltacci, I'm ten years old and today I'm going to talk about recycling.
It is common to use plastic cups in schools, parks, shopping malls, in various places.
Have you ever stopped to count how many glasses you use per day?
When you kill your thirst, the cup is no longer useful, and you throw it away.
Throwing away?
Have you ever wondered where you are going?
From the planet's point of view, there is no "throwing away."
He'll always be somewhere.
And where are you going?
It goes into the environment, polluting the soil, rivers and seas.
If you throw it on the ground, it is carried by the rains to rivers and seas, but, if you throw it in the ordinary garbage, which is the organic garbage, it goes to the landfills, which are places where the garbage is decomposed.
Starting to do simple things: swapping the plastic cup for a returnable bottle.
A few more tips to make on a daily basis: use your own returnable bottle, or biodegradable cups made of cassava starch, rice, sugar cane or paper; do not throw garbage on the floor and, when you go to throw it in the trash, throw it in the right trash.
To remind you sometimes, you can use the three Rs: "reduce", "reuse" and "recycle".
Reduce: consume without waste.
Like I said, to replace the plastic cup with the returnable bottle is already reduce.
Reuse: reuse or create new objects.
And recycle: throw the product in the right trash for it to be recycled.
Now, think to me: is it the garbageman who generates the garbage or who removes it?
Employees who collect the city's trash are not trash.
They are responsible for cleaning the city.
When I use a disposable cup, it becomes mine.
So it's my responsibility to dispose of the right trash.
Do your part and throw the trash in the right place.
And, at the end of all this, what really makes the difference between a healthy and strong world and a whole polluted world?
We make a difference.
The attitude of each of us can change the world.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
