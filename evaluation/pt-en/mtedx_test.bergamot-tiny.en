When I was seven, I couldn’t read, and all the girls in my room knew how to read.
So I kept charging and blaming myself because I wanted to learn like everyone else.
My mother bought me several books that came with CDs and I kept listening to CD and was following, because I could not read.
I learned to read.
And when I learned to read, the whole world opened up for me.
I started dreaming things that I thought I couldn’t do but the books said, “You can!”
One of those dreams was to do university.
No one in my family has a college degree.
But I believed I had to do university.
So I went there.
I have to do university.
I have to do.
I told my mother, “I have to do university.”
She went there, paid a course for me, with all the difficulties she had.
I entered the university at 18.
In an extremely elitist course, which is Architecture and Urbanism, in one of the largest universities in the country.
And then I thought, "Wow, it's my happy ending!
I'm amazed, it's all set."
- Just not.
The university is not a welcoming space for people like me, regardless of course.
What determines the welcome you will have is its color.
And I, besides the color, was a woman.
And I'd like to talk, talk a lot.
But don't talk like that on a stage.
Using writing, and it bothers you.
So I started to feel bad in that space, and you’re going to feel bad, you’re going to feel bad, and when you see, you’re very sad.
And you're not sad one day, you're sad for a month, a year.
You don’t want to leave the house anymore.
And I didn't want to leave the house anymore.
- I was depressed.
The peak of that was when I ended up in a hospital.
And then I was in a crisis, I couldn't talk.
I just wanted to cry.
I just wanted help.
And then that doctor looked at me and said, “You’re depressed.”
What about now?
In 1996, I was three years old and my father left home.
And then my mother found herself alone, pregnant, and with a three-year-old daughter.
This is the story of many women.
Even many women like me, black people.
And my mother, to deal with it, she wrote a letter to me.
I was three years old, I couldn’t read.
I told you I learned well after everyone else.
But she wrote.
And then I understood that my mother had actually written that letter, which I went to read years later, because she wanted to deal with that pain.
After a few years, my grandfather died.
He was like a father to me.
And he was the first man in my grandmother's life, the only one.
The person to whom she gave her life.
And she misses you.
I miss you.
So... Every day my grandmother writes to him.
And I cry because it's daily, it's every day.
She opens a notebook and she writes, "Dear Daniel..." and she tells her day to him.
And then... Years later I read a book called "Eviction Room", which is also a diary of a black woman, poor, favela, who also had to take care of her children without a man present.
And she did it by picking up cardboard on the street.
And this woman, she says in the book, that when she gets nervous, when she can’t handle everyday situations, she wrote.
And she wrote in papers that she would take in the trash And then I needed help and I thought, "If all these women who are important in my life write, why can't I write?"
So I started writing.
He wrote in diaries.
Then I started writing poetry, I started writing on social networks, then someone said: "Don't you want to write a text, on my blog?"
I said, "Oh!
Why not?"
Then I started writing on a blog, then another.
I wrote in one column here, something else there.
I started having thousands of followers, who were black women like me, who texted me and said, "What you write is about me, it's for me."
And I said, "Guys!
That’s much bigger than I thought.”
Then, that year, at the age of 23, I was invited by the largest publisher in the country to write a book.
(Applause) And I say that because writing is important to me.
Writing, as the writer Paulina Chiziane says, literature for her is the way she negotiates her dignity.
Writing is that for me.
So I'm here to try to say what I do to deal with the weaknesses that I can't have, because I'm a black woman, society says I have to be strong, that I can't come here and cry, that I can't go on my social network and say how hard it is to live without a father, for example.
Society says I have to put it all out on my back.
Society says I have to be strong, strong, strong.
I can't take it anymore.
I don't want to be strong anymore.
I want to be weak.
So I write, even so as not to feel so much guilt, to forgive myself.
I suggest you do this, because for me writing is a cure.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My uncle came to Brasilia in 1972, carrying this suitcase here.
That was all he had.
And inside that bag, I had more book than clothes.
It’s funny, but for his project, it made perfect sense, because he came to Brasilia with a very clear goal in his head: “I’m going to Brasilia to be able to study and win in life through studies.”
That’s why he brought so much book in the suitcase.
After he came, my whole family came too, and in this came my mother to make the same movement as my uncle: "I go to Brasilia to study and make my career there."
This whole story happened before I was born.
When I was born, that suitcase was already here.
And the project of this suit gave super correct to both my uncle and my mother: they studied and won in life.
So, by the natural logic of things, a project that worked for my uncle and worked out for my mother would work out for me too.
Only when I went to school, I didn’t find myself in school, I didn’t get along.
And then, very early days, I started suffering from Sunday night syndrome, which was a desperate ghost that would appear on Sunday to say, "O, tomorrow is Monday and you're going to have to do something you don't like doing.
You’ll have to carry a suitcase that you don’t want to carry.”
I suffered from this syndrome almost all my student life and a good part of my professional life as well.
For you to have an idea of every ten people, seven suffer from Sunday night syndrome.
You are likely to suffer from this syndrome as well.
And, if you suffer from this syndrome, it’s because Monday you’re doing something you don’t like to do by carrying a suitcase you don’t want to carry.
The first time I got rid of this syndrome was the greatest luck in the world.
A teacher appeared in my school and she put everyone to do what she most liked to do, and it was really cool because I started to enjoy Monday.
Only I grew up, I entered the labor market, I became a publicist and, after a while, the syndrome bothered me, only this time it was much worse, because I had an established career, I had a son to raise and had a lot of bills to pay.
I had the profession I wanted, the job I wanted, the salary I wanted, but I wasn’t well.
And the truth is this: no matter your profession, your position, your salary.
The truth is that if you suffer from the syndrome, it’s because you carry a suitcase that you don’t want and you keep doing it because you have bills to pay.
I wanted you to stop and think a little bit: what if you had no bills to pay?
What were you going to do with your life?
There are people who will say, "Wow, I can't even stop to think about it.
I have so much account to pay..." (Laughter) Or, "No, I wouldn't do anything.
I was going to travel or watch Netflix all day, I don’t know there.”
But you really think about it, really: would you want to spend your time and energy doing what?
If the answer came in your head there, your exit is there.
You will stop suffering from Sunday night syndrome when you start putting this into practice.
And so, if the answer didn’t come in your head, if the answer didn’t appear at that moment, you need to find it because it’s very serious.
Really, that's very serious.
It is very likely that when you find what you want to do in your life, you do not know how to do and maybe you want to take everything in your bag at once and put it all at once.
Only that's not how you're going to make such an important change in your life.
We exchange what is in our suitcase little by little.
For example, if you enjoy photography, want to be a photographer, you need a camera in your suitcase.
Of course, you don’t need an entire photographic studio.
You need to put the photograph in your life.
If you like cooking, start testing some elaborate recipes with your friends, start doing it for free at first, start to experience at first, put the cuisine in your life.
When you least notice it, your suitcase will be complete and full of things you have decided to carry, things you have chosen, things that make sense to you and that have use for other people as well.
My bag is light and easy to carry.
What I carry in this suitcase today is a project I chose.
It's not a project of my uncle, a project by my mother, an advertising project.
It’s a project I chose, which is to help people figure out what they like to do and they can find ways to live out of it.
On Sunday night, you will remember this conversation that we are having today.
Maybe because you’re okay with Monday’s arrival; quiet because you’re doing something you like, or because Sunday night syndrome is bothering you.
If it's because of the syndrome, it'll pack your suitcase.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause) (Vivas)
(Music) - You see, my good I feel to inform you That I got someone to comfort me That someone is When you leave And I can only believe, because without having you in these arms See well, love Where are you?
We are in the role But not in the living Travel without me leaving myself so I had to get Someone to spend the bad days While this Navigating I go without peace Without having a port Almost dead, without a pierch And I will never forget you, love But the solitude Leaves the heart In this lead and brings you well beyond These facts vile Know, betrayals are much more subtle If I have changed me It was not for evil Love, you see, I have made someone CallI got someone called "saudade" (End of music) (Applause) Thank you.
Thank you.
Good morning!
I was born premature in Rio de Janeiro.
My father had traveled to do the first international show, and he got there in Portugal, called Brazil and my mother was in the hospital, had had a detachment in the placenta and I almost were born.
He came back the same day, the show in Portugal was canceled, and I was born a month later.
(Laughter) It was the first time I came in.
I grew up in this family of artists, very affectionate, very sincere.
My first attempt in the art world was in ballet.
My mother put me in the school where she was studying in her youth.
It didn't last a month.
I liked the classes, but one day the teacher said that the uniform was mandatory and I never came back.
My second attempt was in music.
I started studying piano... sorry, it wasn't piano.
I started studying sweet flute and singing, and then I got into a children’s choir.
And I spent all my afternoons in music school, I bonded very strong with that space and with those people.
Then, one day, I had a presentation in a university room here in Porto Alegre, with the choir, and for the first time I was going to be a soloist.
In a moment I sang the main voice alone.
I was always very shy, so singing in a huge auditorium didn’t sound very comfortable.
And the music, until then, was a joke to me, and suddenly I found myself in responsibility with the group.
Anyway, there were a lot of rehearsals, I was very nervous, but we did the presentation, everything worked out.
I was happy, a little relieved.
And then, I'm leaving the stage, happy and so on, and came a lady at me, smiling, she in front of me, congratulates me and says, "Honey!
It couldn't be different.
It is in the blood.”
I didn't understand what she was telling me.
It was very strange.
What did she mean by that?
I didn’t understand it as a compliment, actually.
It was strange, but deep down it was a little frustrating.
She was referring to my father, who was a musician, or my mother who is also an artist.
Is it in the blood?
You mean I was born with that?
He has several studies in this area.
It has a study that was done in Canada by a Brazilian researcher, with 30 babies.
And some of these babies were exposed to a prelude to Maurice Ravel for ten days three times a day.
At the end of this process, all the babies were subjected to a test, and those who listened to the music at home during the week paid more attention to it than in the other works.
That is, they developed a musical sensibility because they were exposed to music.
I was born in a very musical family.
There was piano at home, any birthday had band in the room.
I have also developed a musical sensitivity, but the environment in which we are inserted contributes to the development of our abilities, our competencies.
And I read a survey that was done in the United States, that when public schools had a short budget, they did music aptitude tests to see who could attend music classes.
That is, the idea was to select those who had ease or genetic predispositions for music.
And they applied this same test to the instrumentalists of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, which is a great orchestra.
And half of the musicians scored below average.
Half of the musicians.
That is, according to these tests, none of those musicians had genetic predispositions for it, to work with it.
But they were there, and they’re great instrumentalists in a big orchestra, it wasn’t the blood that got them there.
We have the record, we human beings have the biological record, the psychological and the imaginary.
It has no prevalence of one record over the other.
We are the mooring of the three.
Today I understand the discomfort and frustration I had when I was little.
I do not deny genetics, I do not deny the influence of the social environment before I have even been born.
But none of this would have made me a singer if it hadn’t been my choice.
It's not just in the blood.
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the month of May, it is making eight years that I am inserted in this project, which I am dedicating everything I have.
But basically, I like to say that I’m dedicating half of my breath to this project that I’m going to talk to you today, and that is giving results that we imagined should happen, just not with the speed that is happening.
Eight years ago, I was introduced to a disease that, until then, I did not know, and that is quite likely that most of us all here do not know.
Even medical professionals know, but are not necessarily prepared or know how to act when it is identified.
I am talking about sepsis, also commonly known as hospital infection or sepsis, several other words that, when you do not know, talk about it.
Even a Brazilian research institute did a survey last year and asked on the street if people knew what sepsis was.
Ninety percent of them thought it was a rock band.
(Laughter) That ignorance is general.
Sepsis, since it was identified as organ dysfunction, has killed more than 100 million people worldwide.
Sepsis is a disease that kills more than a traffic accident, not only in Brazil, but all over the world.
Every two minutes, sepsis kills one person all over the world, and on May 28, 2010, sepsis killed my daughter.
On May 29, I had to close a tomb and I didn’t know what to do with all the love and the expectation that I built on those 18 days that she stayed with us.
Laura was born on May 10, 2010 and she changed the interface with me on May 28, 2010.
Since that day, I am dedicating absolutely everything I have: my heritage, house, car... motorcycle.
That's the hardest part.
(Laughter) Everything.
Today I dedicate my whole life, all my energy; today I share this project with 25 people who are completely passionate about what we are doing.
Today Laura is implanted in a few dozen hospitals and transacting the data of millions of patients.
What she is doing in each of these hospitals is identifying which patient has sepsis.
I will already explain a little more how it works, but I think that, first of all, it is necessary to understand what limitation there is in this context.
If we look at other diseases, other operational problems, they are related to organic triggers, biological triggers.
A person who has a heart problem automatically will have a heart failure, and this will trigger a protocol.
Sepsis has no biological trigger.
It simply brings together several factors that end up deteriorating the patient’s clinical situation, regardless of whether they are an ICU patient or a patient who is inside a bed in a normal ward.
He's taking that risk.
In fact, any of us run the risk of having a sepsis at any time.
The difference of other diseases is that sepsis is completely controllable if it is seen in time.
If, in the skill interval, professionals are able to make the necessary interventions, at least sepsis the person does not die.
She will die perhaps of the comorbidities of her illness, she will die of other problems, but sepsis she does not die.
That is what we are doing.
I developed the world’s first cognitive risk management platform.
They are artificial intelligence robots that connect to the databases of hospitals, which connect to the machines of laboratories and remotely analyze this information hours in advance.
They make this traffic in a fraction of seconds inside the hospital and can advance the person’s risk situation by about ten hours.
They indicate, of all patients admitted to the hospital, which of them are at risk of sepsis, which of them are at risk of being in a clinical deterioration that will lead this person to sepsis.
Today, two years after we activated Laura...
The first hospital in which we activated the robot was on July 26, 2016, in a philanthropic hospital in Curitiba, by the way, the bravest of all, because the sisters had the courage, that many others did not have, to bring an innovative technology, an unknown technology, but a technology produced here, Brazilian, made with love, made with affection, made with attention, made with attention, but that is at the forefront, that leaves nothing to wish for anyone.
They accepted we activated this technology in Curitiba, and since then, Laura has saved hundreds of people.
She identifies, more than ten hours in advance, who will have this problem.
In addition, it is transacting the data of millions of people, and all this with the sole goal of accelerating the diagnosis or the prediction that this is happening.
We could treat this in many ways.
Technology in health is not new.
Artificial intelligence is not new.
But what is behind this project is a simple word, it is something related to what we all have and we give for free: love.
I could have taken all that expectation of mine and put it on another platform, or I could have put it in other conditions or have forgotten or treated grief in other ways.
But that’s not the loss that has motivated me.
It’s the love for Laura, and the promise I made to her, on May 29, that no one would forget her name in this era and that no mother would sleep crying because of a totally controllable situation, is happening today, and soon will help many more people around the world.
So impacting a billion lives is not difficult, as long as you don’t make your life restricted to pain or loss, you dedicate it to someone.
So, "skin" to save lives with us?
- Thank you, guys.
(Applause) (Vivas)
Rogério Martins is a professor and researcher in mathematics at the Faculty of Science and Technology of the New University of Lisbon.
Bet on scientific dissemination to the general public, and is the author and presenter of the television program 'This is Mathematics'.
What would you like to reverse?
"The image of mathematics, of course."
(Applause) Rogério Martins: I am a mathematician, and I want to talk about some of the reasons why I fell in love with mathematics.
Contrary to what many people think, I have in fact never been a brilliant student to mathematics.
In fact, when I was a high school student, I wasn’t a brilliant student.
I wasn't interested in the subjects I was studying.
They really interested me, and I always found all the areas passionate.
In fact, it's one of the things I want to talk about to you.
But the truth is, I didn't have a lot of interest in having good grades.
When I went to college, I had a lot of interests.
From economics to psychology, to biology.
But the truth is, I couldn't get into these courses, because I didn't have enough grades to come in.
I ended up in mathematics.
For better or worse, because I immediately fell in love with mathematics.
I want to tell you essentially what led me to fall in love with math.
Suddenly, of average grades, enough to pass, I had one of the best averages of the course.
What made me fall in love with math?
I would say the first reason was when I realized that mathematics was about ideas.
In high school, I found mathematics interesting, but there were many accounts, I didn't understand which Big Picture was.
I'd say the bills are for math, how dripping is for basketball.
Actually, we have to know how to dribble to play basketball.
But what's really beautiful, is to watch the game, watch the game happen, watch the move back.
See the strategy.
And it’s exactly the same with the music, as we’ve seen before.
It is true that we have to practice scales, but what is beautiful is to listen to the complete work and enjoy it.
With mathematics it is the same thing.
And I realized one day that, in fact, mathematics was much more about ideas than I thought.
It is much more a philosophy of life than a set of disconnected and meaningless equations.
That was one of the reasons that led me to fall in love with mathematics.
The second was that I realized that I could get to a lot of things — a lot of those things I liked: biology, economics, sociology, all that stuff.
I could get there through mathematics.
And that's in particular that I want to show you here, with a concrete example of my work in Mathematics.
It is true that I cannot show equations, because I probably would not perceive them, but I can show something concrete, which has directly to do with what I do, and it is something I usually have in mind when I study these equations.
The idea is this: Now I’m going to do an experiment.
I have two cans here, I have a board, which I'm going to put here on the cans, and here I have two metronomers.
The metronomos, I don't know if you know, are a device that serves to measure compasses.
Basically it is a clock that musicians use to measure the times.
These metronomers are regulated for a certain frequency, in this case 208 beats per minute — it’s a very prestigious one.
I'm gonna put it up front.
You hear that?
I have another metronome here.
In fact, these metronomes, although regulated for the same frequency, do not oscillate synchronized.
In fact, I have now left them here, but they tend not to have exactly the same frequency, although they are regulated for the same frequency.
What's curious, is that when I put them on this board, if you wait a little......a strange thing happens.
They interfere with each other.
I don't know if it's visible from there, but this board oscillates slightly, and they end up synchronizing -- now they're back down.
This synchronization is not immediate, but after a bit end up synchronizing.
This is fantastic, because we humans synchronize many times when we play an instrument, or when we dance.
But that two inanimate objects can do this, in a way, communicate with each other and come to the conclusion of what rhythm they should follow, is in fact an impressive thing.
This phenomenon, which we are observing, is something that was discovered by Christiaan Huygens in the 17th century.
He discovered this by chance, by chance he had two metronomers on the same shelf.
Then it was forgotten for many years and recently, it was realized that it is a phenomenon much more common than previously thought.
For example — I’ll give several examples: In biology, it appears in fireflies.
The fireflies have a flash, and this flash is periodic.
Just as a metronomer oscillates periodically, the firefly also turns on and turns off a light periodically, and interferes with neighbors.
And a fantastic thing happens in certain fireflies communities: they synchronize movements and suddenly start adjusting the flashes, and little by little there are thousands of fireflies that synchronize their movement, as if each firefly were one of these metronomes.
Synchronize your movement and emit a flash all at the same time.
This is a case of synchronization in biology.
There are also cases in the economy.
For example, the markets oscillate and each of them is as if it were also a metronome.
When oscillating they interfere with neighbors through trade, exports, etc.
Once again, there is a synchronization phenomenon that economists study.
Then we have, for example, the case of the power grid.
I don't know if you know, we have a chain called alternating.
The chain swings in our house, in our outlet.
And when an electrical engineer needs to connect a power station to the national power grid, he needs synchronization.
It needs the oscillation of the power plant to synchronize with the oscillation of the power grid.
Again, it is a synchronization phenomenon.
In medicine there is a very busy case, where there are several synchronization phenomena, something called a circadian cycle.
Next we're going to have someone talking about neurobiology, here there's also a little bit of neurobiology here.
In medicine, this circadian cycle is actually an organ that we have in our body.
We have a set of cells that marks the rhythm of the day, 24 hours.
It is basically the clock that makes us go to bed at the same time, or want to eat at the same time.
This is what causes jet lag.
This clock is made of a set of cells, in which each of them interferes with the neighboring cell, and synchronizes the movement with the neighboring cell.
In fact, this set of cells is a synchronization phenomenon.
There are thousands of cells that synchronize in oscillation with neighboring cells.
Here is another synchronization phenomenon.
Then our clock synchronizes with the day-and-night cycle.
Again, a synchronization phenomenon.
Quite curious because, in this second, our clock, our metronome, is still disturbed by the day-and-night cycle, but the day-and-night cycle is not disturbed by our clock, but there is still a synchronization phenomenon here.
This is to show you that this phenomenon, which appears in these metronomes, appears in many areas.
And what do we mathematicians do -- in fact we, I in particular, don't have a laboratory full of metronomes to do experiments, and boards, and cans, and such.
But I have a brain.
I have a brain and I have equations.
What we do, essentially, is extract the theoretical juice from these phenomena that happen in all these areas, and treat it mathematically, with equations, with mathematical tools.
That is the power of mathematics.
In fact, I would say that one of the phrases that best characterizes mathematics was said by Poincaré.
He says that “Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to different things.”
What is happening here, that is, when I mathematically study all these various phenomena, which occur in various areas of human knowledge, I am actually giving "the same name", the same mathematical name, to all these phenomena that, apparently, were distinct phenomena.
It was not realized that they had a relationship until a few years ago.
That's what math does.
Mathematics creates bridges.
Poincaré himself says that the great advances in science are when we manage to connect two seemingly disconnected things, and we realize that they have something in common.
Usually this connection is made by mathematics.
And that's what's fantastic.
I would say that mathematics, or doing mathematics, is leaving a comprehensive footprint—comprehensive because when I work mathematically on a problem, like these of synchronization, which is what has occupied me for some time in the last few years, I am working at the same time on all these problems, and hence the connection with the beginning of my lecture, in which I said I liked all the areas.
I usually tell even my students, or those people who are running for university, that if they like everything, maybe the best is math, because in fact math creates links to everything.
So it is a footprint, I would say, comprehensive, permanent.
Permanent because it is permanent, mathematics has no time.
The Pythagorean theorem is as valid for two thousand years, as it is today.
Mathematics is either right or wrong.
If you're right, you're right, and you'll stay that way forever.
If it is wrong, when much can be (intelligible) and there is some mathematics that falls into oblivion, because it is not interesting enough.
Or because it was not used, because it did not pass to the next generation.
But that's another matter.
That math was right, it's just not interesting.
Not all the math is interesting.
Finally, there is a fantastic feeling of working in mathematics, which is the feeling of treading a path that we perceive that, in fact, is unknown earth.
It’s the feeling that we’ve come to a place where it was impossible for someone not to ever get there.
This is felt above all in mathematics.
It is very common for us to construct theories and realize that these theories are not the fruit of our imagination.
They were there, that is, an intelligent being from another planet, would probably reach exactly the same place.
I would come exactly to the same conclusions—though eventually, with a different language—but, say, the mathematical juice was there, that mathematical idea was there.
And that is, in fact, another impressive thing.
Another phrase that I like a lot — this is a phrase that, for a long time, I had by my side on my desk and that is from Pascal — says: “For space, the universe embraces me and swallows me like a point.
“By the thought, it is I who abarks it.”
This is, to me, the revenge of the warrior, and once again it is mathematics.
When we feel small, physically, there is a certain comfort in thinking that, from a psychological point of view, our imagination, our thinking, is indeed great, and we can reach practically everywhere through our thinking.
In a way, there is a certain revenge here of our smallness.
Finally, and to leave you a little to think, precisely with this thought that is all-encompassing and powerful, I would like to show you the one that is perhaps the problem that will occupy me in the near times.
Or in the next few years, maybe.
In fact, in synchronization, we can’t understand everything.
There’s still a lot to realize, even a lot.
In fact, in mathematics, it is very common for people to have the sensation that it is a little crystallized science, that there is no longer research in mathematics.
In fact, it's exactly the opposite.
Mathematics is one of the most active areas today.
One of the things that we do not understand is this: We have here these two metronomes, and we saw them oscilling, just now, in phase, that is, they oscillated both to one side, the two to the other.
Huygens didn't see this.
He had different metronomes, actually had big clocks.
He saw the two oscillate inward, and the two to oscillate outward.
And that's not exactly what we were seeing.
Now, Huygens could have water.
(Sound of the doynchronized metronomers) (Sãomos synchronized) Here, here you, thank you.
(Applause)
What we know and what we already live in become who we are today.
Our questions, those for which we are seeking answers, will make us who we will be tomorrow.
Curiosity is what is behind these questions.
And curiosity is something I've discovered since I started doing research there in high school.
It just took some time and it took me to cross an ocean, literally, to understand the power of it.
During high school, I did research, studied in a school called the Liberato Foundation, which is relatively close to here.
There, doing scientific research is a true tradition, so all students do research.
From the first year at that school, I started doing scientific projects.
My first project, together with Viviane and Gabriela, two colleagues of the technical course, was there by 2007 and we heard a lot about global warming and the gases that caused the greenhouse effect and we were very concerned about it.
After all, would our school, the school activities that we did there, contribute to global warming?
And then, we made our first project, which was to mathematically calculate and with a lot of data collection, how much our school emitted gas, carbon dioxide, during their school activities; and how much absorbed, because inside the school there was a eucalyptus plantation.
It was a math account, added and subtracted there, and we found that the balance was positive.
The school absorbed more gas than it emitted, that was great for the environment.
We did this project, presented it at the science fairs... and we didn't earn anything.
But it's all right.
We went to the next stage, which was to make a new project.
Because of eucalyptus plantations, we realized that nothing grew around the eucalyptus trees.
And there our second project was to create a natural herbicide with eucalyptus leaves.
What we did, basically, was mixing the leaves of eucalyptus with water, create an extract that could prevent the growth of weeds.
And then we went to a science fair again, showed this project and we didn’t earn anything.
But that’s fine, we were learning a lot from this process.
And then, in the third year, I was no longer obliged to do a project, but we liked that so much, to go to fairs and not to win anything, that it made a lot of sense to continue.
And then we wanted to do something more challenging, it was already our third project.
We decided to change the area completely, maybe the "zica" was because we were working with the environment, so we go to the health area.
And then we decided to create a dressing with nanoparticles.
By a family history, I already knew a little of the amputation process.
The idea was to create a dressing that could be used in the postoperative period of amputation and replanting of limbs.
Basically what we did was put in this fabric some nanoparticles that had antimicrobial effect, then prevented bacteria and fungi from proliferating, and another that had thermal insulating effect, thus would warm the skin and increase blood flow.
Again we went with this project to a fair.
And we didn't win anything.
But then we went in another and started to win some awards.
A little of this experience took me to the fourth project, which is basically a continuation of that third.
After studying so much about the process of amputation and replanting of limbs, I realized that most amputations occurred in people with diabetes, usually in the lower limbs, because these people develop some typical problems, which we call diabetic foot.
And the idea was to use that same fabric to create a sock that could treat diabetic foot.
Because of these projects, I lived experiences that were incredible.
I started winning some awards and it taught me a lot.
But basically, let’s think about how these projects occur, how they come up, how scientists work.
And then I wanted you to close your eyes and think of a phase of your life, wonderful.
This, puberty, can open the eyes.
Puberty is a wonderful phase, a chaos of physiology.
And in puberty, we use a lot of scientific method.
Imagine you there for 13 years when you were looking in the mirror and suddenly noticed a red dot right in the middle of your forehead.
It was a pimple.
Scientists start just around, by observation and then they identify the problem.
That's definitely a problem.
On the weekend you have a party and, pxa, no one wants to take pimple at the party.
And then you leave for chance.
And your chance is that you can remove that pimple using your hands.
And then the scientist goes to the next stage, which is the planning and execution of some experiment.
You go in front of the mirror and squeeze your spine.
Then we go to the result.
The result was bad: its spine is now visible from 10 meters away.
Before you get to the party, she will arrive before and give "hi" to the guys.
And then we go to the conclusion, which is the final stage.
But in fact, it never has an end, because always, in science, when you come to a conclusion it brings you many other questions.
Basically, we start with observation, and we find a problem.
Creates a hypothesis, plans and executes an experiment that brings results, a conclusion, and new questions.
I learned a lot when I did research; but I had not yet learned what existed more special and essential in being a scientist.
I had to go to Israel to see that.
In 2013, I was selected to go to Israel, for a five-week research exchange, at the Weizmann Institute, which is one of the largest research institutes in the world.
And I was there, in the midst of 80 other young people from all over the world, all about to enter university.
And I was put to work with my mentor, who was a neuroscientist named Hila Harris.
With her, what I was doing basically was trying to understand some of the functionalities of the brain.
I always came to her and asked: "Hila, what we will be able to solve when we understand what your project wants to unravel.
What problem will we solve?”
She was like, "Kawoana, I don't know what this is going to do."
I was so frustrated with that, because in my vast experience as a scientist throughout my high school, I thought that scientists were people who used the scientific method to solve problems.
It was not really that.
At a dinner with the president of the institute, he told us that there at that institute the scientists were selected for their degree of curiosity.
Curiosity was the word.
It didn’t matter what fit his project, what mattered was how motivated he was answering some questions.
I had never stopped to think that way.
I always thought what they would serve the projects I was doing.
But when you work motivated by your curiosity, to answer some questions for which we still have no answer, you go beyond the boundaries of knowledge, because you were not predicting that result and usually the results that we do not predict are great.
Thus, too often, real problems are solved by the result of these researches that arose from the mere and genuine curiosity of scientists.
So curiosity seemed to be the key word of this process.
But it's not any curiosity.
There is a phrase from Eça de Queiroz that says: "Curiosity is the instinct that leads some to look through the keyhole and others to discover America."
So that seemed to tell me that there were questions that deserved to be asked.
And it’s about this look of a scientist, about this curious look, that I would like to talk to you about.
What are the questions you want to answer?
And to rescue this look you need to go back a little to be a child.
Children are always full of questions.
Where do babies come from?
After all, why the blue sky, why do I have to sleep at this time and why do I have to go to the bath?
Children are always full of questions, but when we become an adult, we become full of certainties.
We think we know who we are and how the world works.
And we forget to ask questions.
And then we forget that being a scientist is wanting to break paradigms; having a curiosity that is genuine and a will to change the world.
When we turn on TV, open the social networks, the newspaper, every day, what we look at is a world full of certainties, of facts: politicians in Brazil are corrupt, public health in Brazil does not work, and public education is terrible; you have to take care when you go out on the street because everything is so violent.
And we forget that certainty leaves us in our comfort zone and that it is in the questions that we grow.
If we were more a scientist, if we saw each one here as a scientist, we would forget the certainties and ask questions.
How can I improve education in our country?
If I reduce social inequalities, I can interfere with urban violence?
So to be a scientist is to bring more questions to the game.
And it is about these questions that I would like to share with you my current questions Because since I started doing research, I started to be more restless.
I found that I could be the protagonist, and that of all these problems that we see in the newspaper, I could choose one, the one that maybe made my heart beat stronger and try to create a question, thus plotting an experiment, arrive at some result and maybe change a little reality.
Thus came a project called Beta Scientist.
I did research throughout my high school, and after some time, I no longer knew much what to do with that experience, that wasn’t just telling people that I had done that.
I have a father at home who always said that I had to write about it, talk to the young people that they could live that, there were so many young people who didn’t know they could do that.
Inside I had a question that made my heart sleep every day tight, which was what I can do with all that I lived with.
Is it possible to transform the lives of other young people, as mine has been transformed?
Once you are a scientist, that you have a question, you have two choices: either you put it in the drawer and forget it, or you will do an experiment.
And so a came an initiative called Beta Scientist, which connects young Brazilians with science.
What we do is, with a group of very engaged people and very committed, we connect young people who are in high school to scientific project.
We encourage these young people to look at the world with a curious look of a scientist.
We say that they can be restless and no problem, that’s great.
That those problems that they see in the world around them can be solved and that they can create a scientific project to propose some kind of solution.
What we do is offer content on how to do research, mentors from all over the country who have already done research and start to follow these young people, and challenges.
So I ended up somehow answering a little of my questions.
That question that was tight now had an answer: yes.
Making a scientific project during high school, having the eyes of a scientist, can change the lives of these young people and is changing the lives of young Brazilians.
I can see in the future, how much this can transform a little of our reality in education, in our country.
How much more than creating projects, what we are creating are young people who create projects and create solutions.
Young people who are more protagonists and who see themselves as part not of the problem, but of the solution.
But since I am a scientist and to me what matters are the questions, the question that is inside me today is: what are these young people going to do in great?
How will they still surprise us?
And for you, I wanted to ask what question you move?
It’s about having a new look, it’s about our very existence.
What is the question that sleeps and wakes up with you every day?
Are you giving vent to this question, creating an experiment, that brings you some result a conclusion, and new questions again?
In 2010, after that succession of events of doing a project, going to pauma fair, not earning anything, doing another project, going to pauma fair and again not winning anything, there came a time when I left the zero score, which was to go to a fair and gain nothing, and then I managed to win a place in the largest science fair in the world, which happens in the United States.
And being there, representing my country, completely transformed my life.
And I remember I was entering the fair, first time in the United States, first time in an international event, first time going to show what I was doing, to people who spoke another language.
And then I enter the fair and have a very big sign written: (English) "Welcome to tomorrow".
- Welcome to tomorrow.
And then I understood that all that search for the answers, while I did projects, made me build a tomorrow that did not exist.
So what I can leave maybe you think about what tomorrow you want to build.
Listen to the questions that are inside of you.
Because when we seek these answers, we build a future that still does not exist and goes beyond the borders of what we know.
We create a better world, or at least we become better people.
After all, what we are and what we already live, what we know becomes who we are today.
And it is the questions, those for which we are incessantly seeking answers, that become who we will be tomorrow.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
If time allows I want to discover places The many that I have not seen and that in fact there are thousands If there is thousands If the time allows me to transmit my truth Starting the broken will fall the makeup if he allows, we will be the source and guideline Change Change in the country, in the music 1 million bis If the time allows the time to allow in the life that I was born street to hear me not to let go of the mouth, if the time allows us to remain firm I speak the whole team of the faithWe will give morals their real value if time permits in life I want more to honor blackness and also our ancestors.
(Applause) (Vivas) Save, family.
I'm Rafa, I'm part of the ra rap group Rafuagi, and the message I've been leaving for you here today is that I believe in the youth.
Does anyone believe in youth?
Do you believe in the youth?
Audience: Yes!
Rafa Rafuagi: This all made me believe that, increasingly, the creative solutions to the problems of our country emerge from the peripheries.
Emerging the knowledge of the Global South, and this Global South made me understand and participate in several collectives during my trajectory.
There are almost 20 years of hip hop, I started very early.
but in this, I could understand that, in fact, this knowledge of the Global South gave us condition to create real projects of impact within our communities, but, much more than that, transform for what we wished had happened, maybe, when I was 15 years old, and it did not happen, it came to happen now, when I was 30.
But this all made me understand that to believe in youths is also not just looking at our navel.
And, yes, look for the diversity that exists, especially in South America.
From there I met the Hip Hop al Parque Festival, which today is our great reference, and currently is the largest window of dialogue that exists in Latin America, especially with peripheral youths.
Every day there are 100,000 people in this festival that is in Bogota, Colombia.
We were there in 2014, bringing this experience, and made us understand the possibility that there is, not only within hip hop, but precisely in these forms of dialogue that we have.
In addition, another project that we bring as a reference is the Commune 13, in Medellin, which made Medellín a reference in public policies, not only in Colombia, but mainly in South America as a whole.
In 2012, I met a friend who is called Boaventura de Sousa Santos, is a sociologist, we have been working together since then, and on that occasion he asked me this way: "Look, Rafa.
If one day you could meet someone, who would that person be?”
Then I quoted, "Ah, professor, Jay-Z.
Exchange an idea with Jay-Z."
Then everyone laughed: "No, Rafa is there in Esteio, Rio Grande do Sul, Jay-Z is there in Brooklyn, New York..." “There is a theory that we are five steps away from anyone in the world.”
"Like that, Professor?
What is that talk?”
Five steps: Rafa is a friend of Bonaventure, Bonaventure is friends with Kenny West, Kenny West is a friend of Jay-Z, I was three Jay-Z people.
Everyone was stunned, not of me being three Jay-Z people, much more so for Boaventura to be friends with Kenny West, they thought so... (Laughter) But it's okay, right?
What did he mean to tell me, in practice?
That things were not as impossible as they seemed, if we networked collectively, together, truly.
Now, for this, we began to think: with what can we join the boys, what will work out?
In 2017, we created the House of Culture Hip Hop of Esteio, the first in the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the largest in Latin America.
It's 1,700 m2 in space, and this house is in Esteio, and I already invite you to know.
There, in a year and a half, more than 10 thousand young people have passed; we always make an account: considering the Brazilian family on average with four people, then there have been more than 40 thousand people directly or indirectly impacted by ideas of solidarity and the idea of a collective growth through citizen and vocational training that these young people receive.
In 2018, we, then, brought an idea that is UPMS, which now in 2019 materialized in 2019, the Popular University of Social Movements, which at this very moment is happening temporarily at the headquarters of the FMP, Fundação Escola Superior do Ministério Público, here in Porto Alegre, which seeks, through popular knowledge, to bring out a new form of education within the academy, but, much more than that, this ecology of knowledge, how we are doing here today, which seeks, through popular knowledge, to emerge a new form of education within the academy, but, much more than that, this ecology of knowledge, how we are doing here today, it is that is the collective sharing of information.
These projects are part of a tripod of projects in which we believe as a real transformative source of our communities.
The third is the Hip Hop Museum.
This museum does not yet exist, will be created in 2022 in the Bronx, in the United States, but we are seeking this reference to also bring this experience to Brazil, precisely so that our memories, all these statements that have passed here and talked about memories, are eternalized and can inspire future generations, so that we can actually have a much greater awareness while our self, but, much more than that, a more respect and a society.
Through this, we can already see the result in practice, and this result goes beyond numbers.
And we say that this result generated engagement of people for these causes all of them, are artists, like those who are here with me in the photo, like Thaíde, Afrika Bambaataa, but so many other names that we can say that participated and actively participate in this collective construction.
But actors and actresses of organizations, from institutions, such as the Public Ministry of Labor, through the allocation of TAC resources for the projects, be it the ILO, the International Labor Organization, which exclusively this year is turning 100 years ago, be the UN Woman, through He for She.
There are several actors and actresses who are involved, rightly understanding and understanding that these projects are strategically essential for the practical transformation that we need in our society.
With this, we see that this partnership agreement network brings us to a logical reasoning, which is what we believe, which is prevention.
I could give several examples of prevention here.
Can anyone give me an example of what prevention is?
Is educating for diversity prevention?
Is equal conditions and opportunities prevention?
Is public policy prevention?
We also believe that.
We believe this and, by believing this, we have sought to understand this larger system that often, as AD [Junior] brought, puts incarcerated young blacks en masse... And, for example, here in the Rio Grande do Sul Phase, currently there are 1,263 interns.
If we made a basic account, today every young person who is internal in the Phase costs the state of Rio Grande do Sul R$ 12,000 per month.
If we made an account about a thousand young people, today these thousand young people, a year, would have the cost of R $ 144 million.
With R$ 144 million, we keep open, serving 4,000 young people per year, 480 Houses of Hip Hop Culture.
This gives an audience contemplated by a public policy of 1 million and 920,000 young people, which is almost 100% of the young population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
If we make that account of multiplying by four, of the family, there would be more than 7.6 million people impacted by a public policy of inclusion.
It would be almost 100% of the population of the state of Rio Grande do Sul.
And Rio Grande do Sul, which, by the way, is the most racist state in Brazil.
But for this to happen, it is necessary that this comrade, this young man, when he leaves the Phase, not resurrected, he does not return to the Phase, because in this way, too, he is feeding the system.
And, in fact, this resource remains used precisely for that function.
But much more than that, it is to understand that when this young man leaves, it is necessary that our communities be prepared for this welcome.
Because going out and coming back to sameness, in fact, nothing will do any good.
And today, there is a lack of public policies, lack of respect, there is a lack of things within the communities that, more and more, unfortunately, keep these young people within the system.
Now, for this, we saw that all this result, and that is what I seek to share with you here today, about these results, in fact, in practice, they only happened because, in fact, there was engagement and there was a strategic network thinking.
Today we act in a logic of multiplication of three, which is precisely this exchange through the sharing of information, an idea.
For example, we started a network of 100 people, and that network, the idea was: I learned something, I will pass it on to three other people.
These three have learned, they will pass for six.
These six, for nine and so on.
In this account, if we multiplied these 100, with 3 out of 300, those 300 with 6 were 1,800, 1,800 by 9 gave 16,200.
But this, in practice, has given itself and shown us what?
That today our South America has a population of 587 million people.
I speak exclusively of South America, being our country, obviously Brazil, the largest country in our continent.
But if we had the possibility of dialogue with these people, how could we do it in practice?
We started thinking about it too.
And this logic of the multiplication of three, she came in good time, to the extent that we managed to object to this information sharing more and more quickly, either with projects, or with examples, or with attitudes, or in any other way, to understand that, today, my great goal of life, as well as my partners, who are running together, my partners too, is, in the next ten years, we dialogue with half of the continent of South America.totally free from the North American ties, the European ties, but, much more than that, a continent that we can, in fact, say that this continent makes a difference in the world insofar as people live with dignity.
And this, when I speak of dignity, is precisely that this mathematical account was able to remit to us, we are already coming in a very expressive number, but I make a challenge for you: today you have heard many people, many ideas, many feelings, loaded with truth.
Who would be, for example, the three people you would leave here and would share what you heard or learned or liked today?
Can you shout some people's names?
Who are the three people?
Is it hard, like this?
Don't have three people in your network?
The names, I want names, who are these people?
Scream there!
(Stalons of the audience) José, Ana, Felipe, Tiago... (Stalons) Bruna, Mari, João... All of these people.
It is important that we understand that these people are also in the same struggle and often what is missing is information.
I often say that information is power, and the truth is revolutionary.
Now, it is necessary that we understand that, increasingly, we have to start from the zone of theory for practice.
The problems are urgent.
The causes are emerging.
And in this, for every speech, you have to have an action.
For every action you have to have a new idea.
So that we can truly see this transformation in practice, but much more than that, to make new forms of resistance and new ways of proposing projects emerge within the peripheries.
My mother told me a sentence once, and I'm going to close it here with that phrase.
Unfortunately my mother couldn’t be here today, but she’s sure to be watching me, and she says to me, “Look, it’s not enough that we’re happy.
Others need not be disgraced.”
And I'm going to look good at that camera, because in a month I'm going to be a father and I'm going to say, "Augusto, it's for you, for you that I'm fighting and all of us too."
Thank you very much.
(Applause) (Vivas)
So I’m going to start here by talking about a love letter from Ademar Bogo in which he talks about education.
He says more or less: that educating comes from the Latin "take away from within"; but the matter and the elements for education come to us all from outside.
These things when they are out, when they enter, they become consciousness and when they leave, they should at least turn into actions.
So, taking is an illustrative gesture.
It takes from within the consciousness what is sought.
Therefore, education has a valid function for life, which is to awaken the sleeping actions and taking away from within us, actions of rebellion and restlessness so that we do not settle.
When I was asked to come and talk here about education, the first thing I did was talk to a history teacher, my friend, and see some lectures about it.
In this, we realized how much talk is about how the current model of education does not work.
But what is it going to work?
And you want me to work for?
Such a high school reform, or explicitly that it works for training focused on the labour market.
To train cheap labor.
I, like the crowd of occupations, also think that the current model of education does not work, but our idea of working out is quite different.
For us, studying goes far beyond getting a job, earning money to consume without stopping and continuing to support the structures of this system.
(Applause) (Vivas) We hope that education, that the relationship with knowledge, is a means for us to discover about the world and discover about society, not to reproduce it, but to consciously participate in its transformations.
But in the society in which we live, wanting this is to be a danger, and more and more, we see being treated with bombs and gag who is fighting for this kind of "dangerous" education; who cares about an education that helps to think, problematize, and that uses the sciences to deconstruct prejudices, is suffering reprisal, is suffering persecution, and are having laws constituted against them.
Not that it is something new that laws do not aim at a good for the working class, but they want to make it impossible for very important issues to be debated in school.
School is an environment in which we spend a lot of time in our life, our first relationships with other individuals.
So, consequently, it should be there that we learn to deal with these other individuals and, above all, respect them within each individuality.
But thus, in the occupations, when we talked about these issues of our daily lives, which were often debated, we respected all thoughts, because we think and agree, that all people have different knowledge and none of these knowledge is more or less important than the other.
There was a guy who had been thinking about this for a long time, and he is internationally recognized, but within that crazy situation we are living in, even he is being persecuted.
That guy is Paulo Freire, and he said... (Applause) that education doesn’t change the world, education changes people, and people change the world.
He also thought that the student is not a deposit in which the teacher has to pour things, and he has to absorb everything.
He believed, like me, that the student and the teacher have to work together and learn new possibilities, and discover new things of life; and he saw education as a liberating pedagogy.
All this may seem utopian, but I am not alone, and the occupations have shown me this.
Utopias, are what help us to walk, because even without knowing where we are going, help us move forward.
I wanted to dedicate this speech to everyone, all and "todes"... (Applause) who still walk and build this utopia together with me and that fight for an education, for a more just society, and who suffer reprisal for occupying the spaces they are trying to take away from us: to the people who fight.
Thank you so much.
(Applause) (Vivas)
What is a hacker?
A hacker is a person who is deeply dedicated to studying and modifying systems, devices, programs.
And thanks to this he can go beyond what is considered normal, within the standard functioning.
And he even manages to overcome barriers, which the creator himself thought were resolved.
There are no hackers just from evil.
There are hackers, for example, who work on free software development.
These people act in communities, in networks and they are usually driven by culture, ideology and motivations.
Culture, ideology and motivations.
So, inspired by this, I come to bring you today a proposal for us to "hack" life.
We hack that set of attitudes and prejudices that seem "normal", that were created by the system and that remain there.
I propose to hack life so that we can break the prejudice and study whatever you want, work with whatever you want, be whatever you want; create what you want, marry whoever you want, have sex with whoever you want.
Because if we live today in a world of such advanced technology, will we want to continue in a world of backward methodology?
Of course you don't!
And we women can mainly hack the sexist software, in the neighborhood, in society, in schools, at home, at work.
If you stop to think about work, how many times do women do not come across aggressive men, who despise their opinion, who interrupt them successively; interrupts once, two, interrupts again and again and again.
So what we thought, me and my team in the agency, was that we could somehow help change this reality in the workplace.
Can we get rid of this problem?
Maybe not, but we can punch a little punch.
Sometimes a small screw prevents an airplane from flying.
And with small punches, a set of small punches, we can win a fight.
When I look at this data here, I wonder how hard the reality of the woman is, right?
These data here, even, remind me of a phrase by Glauber Rocha that said the following: "The function of the prophet is to prophesy, and not to hit."
Far be told that the UN and McKinsey prophesied these numbers, must have studied a lot to be able to see the trends and make this projection of numbers, but the phrase of Glauber gains meaning from the moment, knowing that the data projected are these, we should work harder and move forward to reduce the time in which this reality will be changed.
When I look at this data here, I keep wondering if people know that there are reports and data that show that a work environment that has diversity is a more tolerant, fairer, more creative environment.
I wonder if people know that there are reports from the World Bank, the UN, McKinsey itself showing that in the environment where there is diversity, there is more productivity and, consequently, better results.
This directly impacts the results of the companies.
But why does the prejudice insist so much on persisting?
When we see these phrases here...
How many women have not heard such things in their work environment?
Many.
Surely you know someone, or you must have heard things like that in the workplace yourself.
- Isn't that right?
Well, we decided to study one of the phenomena linked to prejudice against women in the workplace and that has to do with my area of expertise that is communication.
So there are several phenomena of man’s prejudice against woman and “manterrupting” is one of them.
"Manterbing," is nothing more than that persistent habit of man interrupting women in the meeting.
And this is so strong, it is something so universal, that there is data showing that 75% of meetings are dominated by the male voice.
Women are interrupted two and a half times more than men normally in meetings.
So we thought: what will be the little punch that we can give in this problem?
So we created this "app" here, which is on a device that is in everyone's hand, the cell phone.
It was released on March 8 of this year.
The woman calibrates her own voice, then she turns on the device and leaves on the table and throughout a meeting or session the app will automatically measure how many times that woman has been interrupted by male voices.
It is a tool ... (Applause) It is a very high precision tool.
And often people ask me like this: "Oh, but how does the app know if it's a man's voice or a woman's voice?
What if it's like, Ana Carolina talking to Anderson Silva?"
(Laughter) "Does he know too?"
He knows.
Do you know why he knows?
Because it's a physical issue.
The morphology of the vocal cords of men and women are different so is the level of volume that a female voice reaches that goes more or less up to 180Hz, even if it is a deep voice, and from 180Hz it is a male voice, therefore, Anderson and Ana Carolina can talk that will work.
Well, a super simple to use tool, on the hand of everyone, that received extraordinary global support.
These are posters for the app.
It was artists, men and women, from more than 80 countries, who spontaneously made these posters, which were the pieces of disclosure.
As you see, it is a male hand that silences a woman.
In addition, we have gained very great support from the media around the world.
On American TV alone, our app has appeared four times.
In one of the shows, the presenter used live, without her colleagues knowing, and she was interrupted 17 times.
And she showed it live in the air.
It's all there on our website, all on YouTube, you can see everything there.
Also, thanks to a note that came out in the New York Times, we won this panel in Times Square.
For a month, we won free placement to promote the app in the United States, where the problem is very serious.
In fact, it was the place where the app had the most downloads.
Here too, the communication entrepreneurs in Brazil helped us a lot, also with media provided.
I found it very cool because both the owner of the panels of Times Square, as companies in Brazil dedicate spaces for non-profit companies and our app is free, has no profitable purpose.
And finally, this "dashboard", which was our ultimate goal.
There are universities that have been studying this subject for some time and on Monday now, we will open the data of this "dashboard", of these months of use, for these universities that already study the phenomenon, for the press and you will also be able to access; choose the countries, make the correlation.
And we will, firsthand, show you here a little bit the first data of disclosure of this "dashboard".
But I wanted to draw your attention to this: Brazilians must be very proud of a job like this because, according to the UN, there are 198 countries in the world.
Our app was downloaded in 154 and used in 145; on a planet where there are only ten countries led by women.
So we must be proud of the reach and grandeur that a small app has achieved, developed by Brazilian talent, entirely in Brazil.
So, these are the first data that you are seeing first-hand; of using the app, these are the countries where women were most disrupted.
There are countries where women have been least interrupted.
People also always ask me: "But what about Brazil?"
Brazil is right there along the way.
Monday you will enter there on the site and you will be able to check all the data from Brazil.
So these are our little punches for us to win this fight.
Did we have a knockout?
Not a little one.
But we will continue to fight so that one day things like this disappear.
And we want to count on you.
Are we going to hack this problem?
(Applause) (Vivas) Thank you.
(Applause) (Vivas) Thank you.
Hi, my name is Gabriel Vilanova.
Today I came to present about the new cancer treatments.
New treatments can come at any time.
And monotherapy [is] the treatment that stimulates the immune system to fight the tumor.
The Zika virus is capable of killing irregular brain cells, and these cells are especially resistant to conventional treatments.
Immunotherapy is used in some treatments successfully.
The use of Zika virus was tested only in mice and mice.
The tumor was significantly reduced.
How to prevent it?
It is important to maintain a healthy diet, rich in vitamins, in addition to not smoking, drinking alcoholic beverages, and avoid radiation.
Success?
Yeah, we have these treatments.
The problem is the authorization of the Ministry of Health.
If this does not happen, the use of these drugs is prohibited.
But there is another treatment.
He's called friendship.
That year, in the first semester, I had cancer and stayed the first semester out of school, but I communicated with all friends.
And that was the best treatment.
Thank you. Thank you.
(Applause)
When I was small and I was in school, in what at the time was the first degree and today we call elementary school, I was studying in a nun school in the interior of Rio Grande do Sul.
This school operated in a semi-internation system for poor girls.
So these girls paid a symbolic tuition and attended school in a full shift.
All the half-in-the-internal girls were black.
We studied together and grew together, and I knew they were poor, but I hadn’t, at the time, been too much of what it really meant.
Mariana, my best friend, was semi-internal, and in my head we were absolutely equal, entirely equal.
I couldn’t understand why she could stay in school after class is over and I don’t.
I also wanted to play with my friends and learn how to sew, pass and clean, anyway, as they did.
This school, unfortunately, had only primary education.
So in high school, I had to change schools.
Because I left one of the cheapest and most diverse schools in my city and went to study at the best and most expensive Pelotas school, most likely the most "white" too.
In the whole school, I had two black classmates, and it was only when I realized this that I understood that Mariana and I lived in entirely different worlds.
We grew up together, but in reality, we never really had the same opportunities.
Well, well.
I left the school, graduated, entered a public university, graduated in psychology and went to do masters.
During my master’s degree, I spent four months living in Angola, where I developed a research on education and rights of children and adolescents.
When I was in Angola, on a beautiful night, I was talking to a researcher friend, also Brazilian, Cleia is her name, and I asked Cleia why she was in favor of racial quotas of access to higher education.
I remember Cleia took a deep breath and she started her explanation saying: "Airi, the problem is that in Brazil, poverty has color."
The conversation swept through the night, but that phrase of Cleia was hammering in my head.
I went back to Brazil, finished my master’s, started my doctorate, and as I decided what topic to study in my doctorate, while I decided among the various possibilities of the subject, the phrase of Cleia kept resounding in my head: “In Brazil poverty has color.”
I started to think a lot about my friend Mariana and, again, how we were always together, but we never had the same possibilities.
It was then that, with the insistence of this phrase of Cleia and the face of Mariana in my head, that I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, because, after all, if poverty has color, then prejudice needs to be studied.
Here I wanted to do a parenthesis alone, with you, to explain that there is a difference between racial prejudice and racial discrimination.
So, in academic terminology, we use the term prejudice to talk about affective issues.
So, prejudice is related, for example, to like or dislike a particular social group.
Discrimination is a behavior, it is treating someone differently because that person is part of a certain group.
So it would be, for example, to treat a person differently just because of the color of their skin.
Then pt.
Close parenthesis.
I decided that I wanted to study racial prejudice, and the next step, then, was to see how the people of psychology are studying racial prejudice in Brazil.
And when I went to do this research, I discovered something that intrigued me a lot: I found that Brazilian researchers, when studying racial prejudice, have used mainly as an instrument, interviews and questionnaires.
This reason has intrigued me because it is related to a very specific phenomenon, but, to exemplify, I will ask you a question, and I want you to answer me in a very honest way.
Could it be?
- Yeah?
Could it be?
Okay. Oh, it's.
So raise your arm, guys, please, who here in this room likes whites more than black people.
Not? Not?
No one?
Oh, what a wonderful thing, huh!
Do you understand then why I was intrigued to find out that people were using, in Brazil, mainly interviews and questionnaires to study racial prejudice?
Personal, interviews and questionnaires are explicit measures of attitude.
Explicit attitude measures are usually based on self-report, are self-report measures, that is, people can deliberately control your answers, as you did here.
So, this phenomenon that happened here in the room and that happens in the most varied studies is called "social desirability".
Social desirability is nothing more than this: it is when the participant in a survey responds not necessarily what he thinks or feels, but what he thinks the researcher wants to hear.
And social desirability, as I said, happens in the most varied surveys, but especially in those that deal with topics a little thorniest, such as racial prejudice.
Just for you to have an idea, if we only used interviews and questionnaires, only explicit measures, to study the development of racial prejudice in children, do you know that we would find?
We would find that there, by the age of four or five, children respond to what they really feel.
So they would tell you if they like whites or blacks more.
There by the eight, nine years old, children learn that some things they cannot say, that some things cannot be said.
So when I asked them that question, they would answer me exactly what you answered.
They would say, "No, I like everyone the same.
I don’t prefer either white or black, because after all, we are all the same.”
So if we put this on a graph, the development curve of explicit racial prejudice increases in the first years of life.
At a certain moment, there by the eight or nine years of age, it decreases and then stabilizes.
At this point where she stabilizes, most people respond: "No, I don't prefer either.
I like everyone exactly the same way.”
Do you think that data is reliable?
Do you think I can get out of here in the room, get out of this TEDx, and say that no one of these 100 people who are here in this room like whites more than black?
No, right?
I work with science.
I need data that is reliable.
How to solve this problem?
How to measure racial prejudice without having to ask people directly if they like whites more than black people?
Fortunately, some researchers have been studying this topic for a while, a few decades ago, and they have developed a way to study prejudice without having to directly ask people if they like whites more than blacks.
These measures that they have developed call implicit measures of attitude, and they do not allow the participant to deliberately control his answer, as happens when we ask directly to him.
These implicit attitude measures are based mainly on reaction time, which is the time it takes the person to press a button, or to issue a certain response.
One of the most widely used measures around the world is the Impliced Association Test, or IAT.
IAT is a super simple categorization task.
It consists of the following: it is a task done on the computer.
So, we present the participant with a photo of a child and asks him to give the fastest answer he can get.
Then, in the first block, we present the photo of a child and the participant's task is super simple: he needs to say if this is a white child or a black child.
So to give that answer, he pushes buttons.
You saw that there are drawings of children up there.
It has a drawing of a white child and a drawing of a black child.
So, he needs to push the corresponding button to issue his answer.
This is the first block.
In the second block, instead of seeing photos of children, the person sees images that are positive or negative, and the scheme of categories and buttons is exactly the same.
In the third block, the thing begins to get interesting, because now there are mixed images of children, photos of children, and images that are positive or negative.
See that we have two categories on each side of the screen.
So, the participant uses the same button to give a different answer to two distinct categories.
The logic here, folks, is this: if the participant associates white people with positive characteristics, he will press the button faster to give me the answer when white and positive are on the same side of the screen, when we are going to use the same button for these two categories.
If two categories that he sees as opposites are on the same side of the screen, such as black and positive, and positive, and white and negative, as in the case of a prejudiced person, the participant will take a little longer to push the button because he will need to think about what is the right answer.
Guys, it's about 100th second, but it's enough.
So this reaction time measured by the IAT provides us with a measure of preference for one racial group or the other.
Better than asking people straight if they prefer white people or black people, don’t you think?
I think so.
So, in my doctorate, I decided that I wanted to study the development of racial prejudice implicit in children.
I know, you will say, or you must be thinking, that it is the fault of the family; or rather, that it is the fault of the mother; everyone thinks that it is the fault of the mother.
But I am a researcher, I am a scientist, and I wanted to investigate this question better.
So, I decided that I really wanted to study the development of implicit prejudice in children, which is a very studied theme throughout the world, much studied internationally, but little studied in Brazil, and the studies are usually carried out with adult participants and using, as I said to you, explicit measures of attitude.
You know that Brazil is a country with a huge racial diversity and with continental dimensions.
So, what we decided to do was study the development of prejudice in white, brown and black children from two cities with very different characteristics, both in terms of racial composition of the population and in terms of cultural characteristics, which are Porto Alegre, in Rio Grande do Sul, and Salvador, in Bahia.
Guys, the results we found with our research, - we used two implicit measures of attitude and five explicit measures - were that they confirmed results of international studies, which say that regardless of the color of the child's skin, regardless of the color of the person's skin, in our case, regardless of whether the child is white, brown or black, the levels of preference for whites in relation to blacks are very high, and they do not change with age.
Levels of preference for whites over blacks do not change throughout human development.
Here I wanted to resume with you again the fact that the person having a preference for whites in relation to blacks does not necessarily cause them to present discriminatory behaviors towards blacks, because, as I said to you, prejudice and discrimination are distinct concepts.
But do you understand how important this outcome is?
Do you understand how strong it is that, regardless of age, children already have high levels of preference for whites and that this does not change throughout development?
If we were to put this on a graph, instead of having that curve of explicit prejudice that I presented to you, in the implicit prejudice we have this straight line, considering that age is down there.
So, guys, what that means, what these results mean to us, is that maybe it’s not enough for us to keep saying, repeating to the children that they need to like everyone else in the same way because we’re all the same.
Of course, talking about racial equality is important, but more important than talking is putting it into practice.
So, perhaps what these results are telling us is that we need to turn our attention and our investments to combat racial discrimination, to combat discriminatory behaviors, which are, in the end, which makes us have such a high social inequality.
And who knows, if we can reduce this inequality, who knows how to grow in a world in which there is not so much difference between racial groups, so much social and economic difference, who knows how to grow in a world in which a racial group is not so much valued than the other, these children already start from early, in the future, to have low or almost zero levels, preferably for whites in relation to blacks.
After I left my first school, I never saw my friend Mariana again.
I don’t know what end she led, and I confess to you that I blame myself very much for always having all the opportunities she never had.
My doctoral thesis is an attempt to make sure that, in the future, other Marianas do not have their lives defined according to the color of their skin.
My thesis is an attempt to make science contribute to the understanding of prejudice and the reduction of racial discrimination.
My thesis is an attempt to make us have the same opportunities in the future and that we are, so we are really all the same.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We don’t know everything about nutrition.
But more than ignorance in this area, what exists is a lot of misinformation, a lot of noise and people who distort the scientific evidence, deep down to sell a certain message or, eventually, a certain product.
Today, my role is to try to help you demystify some arguments used in this area.
And for that, we're going to use Maria.
Maria was a happy, thin young woman who unfortunately got fat.
She got fat, because she got pregnant, because she had a disease because she worked too hard and didn't have time to take care of her own and was quite unhappy, with her self-esteem down.
One day I was watching the television and the guru appeared.
These gurus go on television to present their diets of fashion, have a very philosophical and appealing discourse but usually empty of content and full of logical fallacies such as, for example, the so-called fallacy of authority.
They've liked to say that the Nobel Prize of this...
Basically, to validate your arguments.
We also have the fallacy of antiquity, that is, that a certain product is good because it was already used in the time of Hippocrates.
We have references or the fallacy of popularity, saying that "already thousands of people have lost weight with my diet", "I have sold hundreds of thousands of books", "I have a six-month waiting list for my consultation".
They also love to use testimonials.
A lady who, for example, weighed 100 kilograms and goes with the guru on television to witness that, in fact, she lost 40 pounds and got much thinner, that diet is spectacular.
The scientific validity of these arguments is zero, for us this is not useful.
In the midst of this conversation, Mary settled in this sentence: "May the remedy be your food and that food be your medicine" said by Hippocrates about 2500 years ago - supposedly said by Hippocrates.
This phrase is a bit pernicious because it leads to thinking that we can use food to cure diseases, right?
In some circumstances, in fact, food can help us control some diseases and even prevent symptoms from being able to stop having symptoms.
But then, there are those who take this concept to the extreme and think they can treat autism, treat cancers, treat serious rheumatologic diseases only with food.
I do not want to say that we health professionals do not value food.
Of course, yes.
In fact, in 2015, an article was published in The Lancet with the aggregation of data from 188 countries, in which food was placed first as a risk factor for premature death.
Therefore, food is important, there is no doubt about this.
What can we do to counter this data in the background?
If you ask the audience, most of you know what it’s like to eat healthy.
I don't understand why we have to constantly be reinventing the wheel.
Everyone knows that they have to eat more fruits, more vegetables, more whole grains and dried fruits.
Dairy products in moderation, avoid red meats, processed meats and sugary drinks.
This is the base.
The most important thing about this message is that to have a healthy diet, there is no one unique way.
There are several paths.
And more importantly, it is not necessary to eliminate any food group.
Returning to the phrase "that the remedy be your food and food be your medicine", already in the time of Hippocrates he clearly distinguished what was a medicine and what a food was.
There was no such confusion.
And someone took the trouble to read the Hippocratic Body, which is about 60 books written by Hippocrates and his disciples, and came to the conclusion that this phrase was never said by Hippocrates.
(Laughter) So if you want a phrase that comes closer to reality I leave you with my phrase: "Food is food... (Laughter) "... medicine is medicine."
(Applause) But Maria, poor thing, doesn't you know anything about this, right?
He consulted the guru.
The guru told him three things: "The energy balance is dead.
“With my diet you don’t need to cut calories.
“The obesity epidemic was caused by international recommendations “that recommended cutting fats.”
But when we look at the data, what do we look at?
We observed that the increase in obesity is practically overperponable to increase the consumption of calories.
By the year 2000, there was a decrease in carbohydrate consumption and an increase in fat consumption.
There was no change in obesity.
A calorie remains a calorie and the energy balance is in good health.
In any case, Maria lost weight, even though she did not realize it, she made caloric restriction.
Only, after a while, he got fat again.
This is very frequent.
Why?
We know that in order to lose weight, as long as there is calorie restriction, all diets are equally effective.
The most important thing is adherence to the diet.
What I tell people, usually, is that they choose a diet that they feel comfortable with and can maintain in the long term.
When Maria got fat, she was sad, with self-esteem down and went to the Internet.
With the Internet we have a serious problem because they follow the logic of "if I eat, then I am an expert on food".
(Laughter) And by putting it together, reading some articles in Google, then we have the Doctors. Google.
These doctors are relatively problematic because they are people who have a low knowledge of the subject, in the scientific area, but they have a perception of their knowledge that is far superior to what they really know and it is very difficult to talk to them.
This is called the Dunning-Kruger effect.
What did licensed doctors at Google tell Maria?
Mary, listen to what these gentlemen have to tell you.
"The nutrologist, the functional nutritionist, 'the 'wellness coach', the orthomolecular nutritionist, 'the 'blogger' or 'vilogger' famous and the 'nutrichef'.
That I add and what I call alternative nutritionists.
Why do I have this designation?
Because what they usually say is bullshit.
Anyway, Maria didn't know this and consulted an alternative nutritionist.
He explained his adventures, he had a weight loss, he had recovered again, he was very unhappy, very mute below.
The nutritionist told him: "Look, let's do some food intolerance tests "to understand which are the foods that go to meet the most" to your profile, Maria.
We have two types of tests.
Laboratory tests, in which we measure the amount of antibodies that are in the blood and, supposedly, this tells us that the person is or is not intolerant of that food, but in reality, when there is presence of antibodies in the blood against certain foods, what the person tells us is that the person was exposed to that food.
The Portuguese Society of Allergology and Immunology came to denounce these examinations, said that they did not have any scientific basis and that asking for these tests was bad practice.
Then we have the famous Vega test that, by name, many people will not recognize, but they are those food intolerance tests done in pharmacies, in some clinics that can detect food intolerance of 700 or 800 foods.
These tests are based on the concept of energy/bioresonance, that is, our body has a base vibration and, if there is change, they can detect that the person is intolerant to a certain food.
We know, at least since 1991, that these tests do not work, have no scientific validity and yet continue to be carried out today.
This is not problematic because the mantras of alternative nutritionists are almost all the same.
“The milk is poison.
Gluten is poison.”
“The transgenics are poisons.”
“Food is full of pesticides and toxics.”
“We have to alkalize the body, eat organic food, ‘do food supplements’ and do ‘Detox’.”
Milk has been demonized recently and in fact there has been a decrease in milk consumption but apart from people who are intolerant or allergic to milk, milk is a great food.
It is cheap, it is much more nutritious than the alternatives, it has no antibiotics.
It has been shown to increase a decrease in the risk of childhood obesity, cardiovascular pathologies and diabetes.
It has no impact on overall mortality.
Then we have "gluten is poison".
In fact, there are people who have celiac disease.
But we don’t even know if being gluten intolerant is a real pathology.
In fact, a recent study has shown that people may react, eventually, it is to the Fructanes that it is a substance that also exists in cereals.
But this is still science quite early.
What do we know relatively well?
It is that when people replace the gluten-free diet with gluten-free alternatives, it increases the risk of having diabetes, cardiovascular pathologies because the alternatives are worse.
Therefore, the person is trying to be healthy, and deep down, he will get sicker.
Then we have GMOs, genetically altered foods.
There will be no food that is put on the table that has not been genetically altered.
In fact, people habitually revolt against genetic manipulation that is more targeted and safer.
But this revolt in the population does not exist in the scientific community.
In the scientific community, we know that GMs are safe have less mycotoxins, which are substances with carcinogenic potential, usually use fewer pesticides and have the effect of halo, that is, even non-transgenic crops on the periphery of transgenic crops need less pesticides, and are environmentally more beneficial because they can produce more foods with less resources.
This discussion that we sometimes see about GMOs, for Western society is not very problematic because we have access to many food.
But in underdeveloped countries it is a very serious problem.
The case of golden rice, which is a vitamin A-enriched rice in which there is a great deal of controversy because they do not want it to be put on the market.
But this golden rice has the potential to save thousands, hundreds of thousands of children from blindness and death.
Then we have the biological.
Things happen a little bit here.
Most people — there are surveys that point to about 95 percent — think organic foods don’t use pesticides what’s wrong.
Organic food — or organic farming — uses pesticides but are natural pesticides.
The problem is that the natural does not tell us if it is healthier, whether it is safer or less toxic.
In fact, there are pesticides used in organic farming as is the case with copper sulfate, which are much more toxic than glyphosate.
And copper sulfate was approved shortly after glyphosate.
He went through the same process.
And no one has heard of the challenge to the copper sulfate.
There is no study that demonstrates that eating organic food is safer and gives people more health.
There are some nutritional differences, in fact, but in terms of health, there are no studies that show advantages in eating biological.
Another myth in this area is finding that organic farming is environmentally better.
The point is that if everyone ate organic food, we would have to use another 20 to 25% of farmland which would lead to a major destruction of natural habitats and deforestation.
Therefore, organic food is not innocent about the environmental impact.
In addition, they are more expensive — about 70% — and, as we have seen, without major associated advantages.
Then we have the fad to alkalize the body (Laughter) that, right now, everyone writes books about this.
This is basic science, i.e. the body has a pH between 7.35 and 7.45.
It is not possible to alkalize the body with food, nor is it desirable.
In fact, the body has several mechanisms exactly to prevent this from happening, whether the intestines, whether the lungs, or the kidneys or saliva.
Therefore, I do not want a more alkaline body or more acid, because I know that when I have a more alkaline body, I will be extremely sick and possibly I will die.
(Laughter) So forget to alkalize the body.
About food supplements, this is a multimillion dollar market I think will reach 278 billion in 2024, and, as Marel said, with various problems.
It is not properly regulated it has contaminated products, adulterated, does not respect the quantity on the label and, even if there were not such problems, which were all spectacular, in fact, the majority is useless, except in specific situations, for example, the issue of folic acid and iodine in pregnant or iron in ferronic anemia.
Apart from these specific examples, they do not matter.
The funniest thing is the antioxidants.
In fact, antioxidants, a while ago, promised more health, prevented aging and then it was concluded that, after all, they increased mortality.
In other words, people were spending money to die faster.
(Laughter) Then we have the famous detox.
which come in every imaginable form, teas, tablets, juices, ene ecological washes, whatever you want.
But what you have to ask is: What toxics do these detoxifiers remove from the body?
And if they remove any toxic, in what way does it act?
Most detox methods can’t answer these two questions.
And even if it answers, we know that there are no controlled studies that show benefits in doing detoxification.
Therefore, to Mary, at the end of this journey, came to an uninformed end, unhappy because she possibly cut in some foods she even liked to eat, and certainly poorer because she spent money on completely useless things.
Worse, Mary can come to an end with a psychological illness called ortorexy.
which is an obsession with eating healthy.
I call it a disease disguised as virtue.
The person spends many hours a day thinking about what is going to eat begins to isolate himself socially because, in fact, he has quite marked dietary restrictions and, later, he begins to have nutritional problems with avitaminosis, serious nutritional deficiencies that can lead to death.
So what I asked you to do is not be like Mary.
If you are fatter and want to lose weight, look for someone who follows the scientific evidence and not the latest diet of fashion.
Look for someone who does food re-education someone who alters lifestyles.
Look for someone who tells you directly that there are no shortcuts to achieving your goals.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hi, my name is Julia Coltacci, I'm ten years old and today I'm going to talk about recycling.
It is common to use plastic cups in schools, parks, shopping malls, in various places.
Have you ever stopped to tell how many glasses you use per day?
When you kill your thirst, the glass is no longer useful, and you throw away.
To play outside?
Have you ever thought about where you are going?
From the point of view of the planet, there is no "throwing away".
He will always be somewhere.
And where are you going?
Go to the environment, polluting the soil, rivers and seas.
If you throw it on the ground, it is carried by the rains to rivers and seas, but if you throw it in the common trash, which is the organic garbage, it goes to the landfills, which are places where the garbage is decomposed.
Starting to do simple things: changing the plastic cup for a twisted bottle.
A few more tips to do on a daily basis: use your own retorn bottle, or biodegradable cups made of cassava starch, rice, sugar cane or paper; do not throw trash on the ground and, when you are throwing in the trash, throw in the right trash.
To remind you sometimes, you can use the three Rs: "reduce", "reuse" and "recycle".
Reduce: Consume without waste.
As I said, changing the plastic cup for the twisted bottle is already reducing.
Reuse: Reuse or create new objects.
And recycle: Throw the product in the right trash so that it is recycled.
Now, think with me: garbageman is who generates the garbage or who removes?
Employees collecting the city’s garbage are not garbage dumpers.
They are responsible for cleaning the city.
When I use a disposable glass, it becomes mine.
So it’s my responsibility to dispose of in the right trash.
Do your part and throw the trash in the right place.
And at the end of it all, what really makes the difference between a healthy and strong world and a whole polluted world?
We make the difference.
The attitude of each of us can change the world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
