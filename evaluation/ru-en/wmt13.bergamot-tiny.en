Republican Resistance Strategy for the Re-Elect of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat election fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of falsifications in elections in the United States are more rare than deaths from a lightning strike.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments have been enacting laws that complicate the process of registration or voting since 2009.
This phenomenon received a new scale after the November 2010 elections, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in just one year 2011, 180 bills were passed, limiting the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require the voter to present an identity card with a photo and proof of the presence of American citizenship.
In addition, these laws reduce the period of early voting, abolish the right to register the voter on the day of the will and take away the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Until the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana became the first state to introduce such a claim.
The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed in 2008 the constitutionality of the law passed in Indiana.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills obliging voters to present identity cards with a photo in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of U.S. citizens, that is, 21 million people who have reached the voting age, do not have an identity card with a photo issued by their state’s government authority.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required ID card often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than 35,000, 18% of citizens over 65 years old, and 20% of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the required ID with a photo.
But that's not all.
Students – voters who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo ID issued by their educational institution.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs who vote mainly for Republicans to use certificates issued by these clubs to vote.
Until 2004, no state required evidence of the existence of American voting citizenship.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove that they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the vote of Latin American people.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on the day of voting in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to assist those who wish to register.
This limitation did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers have passed in five other states laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
So, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the total number of voters in the state.
The same thing happened with Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they accounted for 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, which, forming 76% of voters, among voters were early only 46%.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several draft laws were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended by the intervention of the Attorney General of the United States.
This has partially limited negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring a photo identification certificate.
However, the new rules that have entered into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise the suffrage in the 2012 elections.
Democratic critics condemn the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing them as an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center’s report shows that the states that have passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the electoral level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: to take a test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, pseudo-leggent, and sometimes pseudo-positive, which leads to useless medical intervention.
Men, and so reluctant to undergo medical examination, have something to doubt even more.
To pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States have experienced numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so the findings are difficult to interpret and find it difficult to develop clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found a different mortality rate in those patients who have been screened and those who did not pass it.
This study also showed, after a 12-year follow-up, that the probability of metastases is 30-40% higher in those who have not undergone screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking a test starting from age 50, or with 40 if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African American descent are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision once the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, but making a choice, in these cases, in favor of active observation of the disease.
To date, many men who have cancer will not undergo treatment, as their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active surveillance, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
Increasingly, we determine the criteria with precision to decide who should or should not be treated.
So I would recommend taking a test.
But it is also important to consult your doctor to determine whether or not to take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to assess all the pros and against passing the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonder recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of the disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and move enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one else smoked, that figure would have increased to at least 50%,” said Andre Bolye, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, smoking control remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to human health.
“Even today in Quebec there are 1.5 million smokers,” said spokeswoman Andre Boilet.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
Weight
According to CAR data, overweight and obesity also contribute to the disease.
They increase the risk of cancer of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
“Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,” the association added.
Food
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too many quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salut can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,” the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies can not be called unambiguous.
According to SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer, there is also no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Bolyo stressed that it is important to discuss his anxieties and family history with a doctor.
"The test does not lead to cancer."
Higgs Boson in Detail
Last summer, the announcement that scientists may have discovered the Higgs boson caused a real stir – and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, no less.
In addition, it is the last particle, the existence of which was predicted within the framework of the Standard Model - our best, or, at least "the least imperfect" description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which before could not be detected by experimental means.
But physicists are not yet fully sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is still lacking for full confidence.
Let’s imagine that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law is completely inevitable, which says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise harm yourself.
But although the physics of elementary particles is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of this nature: the principle of Pauli, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same “quantum state” – this “state” is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called ferrios, who prudently obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, the bosons, the nefarious gang of anarchists, who have no respect for nothing - at least to this principle, which means that they can calmly be in the same place at the same time.
According to the site (bite, completely extraordinary) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the “force particles” through which the main forces of nature are spread and to which the Higgs boson relates in some way.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, not all such exotic creatures as one would think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or a “light particle” that is the “courier” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one particle with an electric charge is accelerated or altered direction, it “disturbs” the electromagnetic field in this particular location, roughly like a stone thrown into the pond.
From this "violation" is born an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet radiation, etc. d.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and, therefore, one of the bosons of "transferents".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, the Higgs field, should be “disturbed”.
However, the Higgs field is much much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; in order to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very, very high energies, as if it was about a frozen pond, the surface of which could only shake a very large stone.
That is why you need a huge particle accelerator, like the one that is operated in CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such huge energies.
An analogy with an electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the ratio between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never hold on the refrigerator.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (as a photon, by the way), do not have it.
So, what "can bring" all these studies, asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the correctness of the Standard Model (CM), and this also allows physicists to find a discrepancy between observations and CM predictions.
In addition, some of them are passionate about such a divergence to be found. c. The slightest discrepancy can open the door for the “new physics” and shut down some of the Model’s holes.
The latter, I must say, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But so far, such discrepancies have not been found in CERN.
Consequences
The benefit of these studies for the daily life of the average person is more difficult to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
See: in the early 60's, the pioneers of laser research in Bell's laboratories could not even imagine what kind of revolution their work will cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked in Bell Labs, where a laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previous were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally seen as a “laboratory gadget.”
Imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the tools accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his optical research in 1969.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose, now serves as an “eye” for all the digital cameras in the world and earned the Nobel Prize in physics in 2009.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Grand Hadron Colliderar will definitely change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die. | "Duty"
The Commission for the Worthy Death Commission recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should soon resume, and a bill is being prepared at this time.
Nevertheless, much remains to be done in this critical area.
"Debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. There was another one in his apartment in Monterezi.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed it from the inside, gave him a delay of two years.
“I was given five years, I lived seven,” he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the reception of Victor-Gadbois’s palliative care in Beloy, where he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, it’s impossible to prepare for it,” he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet on your own and even eat on your own.
Sitting at a table on which there is an appetizing lunch, he gives up and agrees to help him eat.
He is invigorating, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicines, lead him to the bath.
Courage before normal death.
“My biggest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
“During our lives, we are taught that a man should urinate standing,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor-Gadboi’s orphanage.
Recourse to the child's state - for some unbearable humiliation.
“It all depends on a person’s ability” to accept the decline, he says.
Since, according to many people engaged in palliative care, important events happen in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter the Victoria-Gadbois palliative shelter are all cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more assistance called “medical”.
Ms. A., 89, is most afraid of dying "suffocation from suffocation."
But the disease allowed me to recognize my children.
“I have good kids,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything else in my life,” she says, before allowing her to put a breath-flammable mask.
She is still waiting in the coming days of the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the shelter, Victor-Gadboa, with the help of a group of volunteers, body care and nutrition assistance are provided.
This is palliative care, which remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11 700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care institutions.
This is very little given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life continues in the best conditions that are possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it is physical, emotional or mental comfort.
We will agree to provide mouth rinsing from brandy or Pepsi, depending on what he asks for.
Diabetics are no longer forced to control the sugar level.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning, his son finished this beer in the feet of the deceased.
“We help loved ones, as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the shelter of Victor Gadbua, no day is like the previous one.
Next to the 93-year-old old man, who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the yard, sitting on his pillows during a toast in his honor, tragically dies a young man of 36 years old, surrounded by parents, wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
“In the last six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victoria-Gadbua shelter come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The Problem of Access to Palliative Care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care, which is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in the hospital or in the shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Ghadboua Shelter and the Society for Palliative Care at the Home of Greater Montreal, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in the health care system of Quebec that forces many doctors - specialists in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that legalizes euthanasia and self-suicide care.
Since October, a manifesto signed by palliatic care luminaries has been circulating, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapuant and testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to palliative care of high quality before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, “I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I am afraid that patients want to die just because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists until the last day try to save patients, despite pessimistic prognosis.
The expectations of Helene Richard’s survival were already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she regretted that I was stopping the fight, she says.
She told me that my days were numbered!
There is no all-powerful care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask for death, thank the medical staff, for not fulfilling their request, after the palliative care team relieves their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Household of Palliative Care at the Greater Montreal House, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until his death, either from time to time or constantly.
It is impossible to pretend that we do not know about this suffering.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain can have access to palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanasiaded for me,” it means “I want to make me feel better.”
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Institute for Health Research in Canada.
Large-scale scandals of real estate in Quebec
Officials responsible for the construction of roads, construction contractors, political party funders and specialists in the Italian mafia day after day say what they know about the colossal “system” that entangles the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and the mafia.
The “Industry”, which cost Quebec taxpayers very dearly, especially in 1990 and 2000.
“It’s curious how this system crumbles after all the means were put into business, jokes Jacques Dushenho, a deputy and former chief of the Montreal police.”
It was thanks to him that a scandal erupted in 2011 as a side result of the investigation of the official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the prime minister of that time from the liberals, Jean Share, agreed very reluctantly.
The Dushenault Relief established a direct link between industry, secret funding for political parties and corruption.
“Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, he said, would have kept a billion dollars on contracts” if some restrain their instincts took a share.
The Charbonne Commission has “has already displaced the two mayors,” he adds, hoping that she will be able to “open the schemes behind individuals.”
Permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, which included a vast staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts, was involved in the case.
And, in addition, employees of the special unit "Hammer", who after 2009 forced the "sewagek cartel" of Montreal, to stop overestimating the cost of contracts.
Over the past weeks, a series of searches has been conducted, and some municipal officials, in particular Frank Zampino and Richard Marcott, the mayor of a small town, were charged with fraud and corruption.
Next in line is Gilles Waiyankur, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in Quebec province.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, official charges were brought against several engineers of the communications services of Montreal and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accuruso and Lino Zambito.
The latter detonated a real bomb, leading to the investigation about the “system” of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambitho gave 3% of the value of contracts concluded in Montreal, to a medium-sized intermediary associated with the mafia, who, in turn, transferred the money of the party of the mayor Gerald Tramble “United Montreal”.
In 2000-ies Zambitho garnished with money to the right and left. He transferred more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to various parties of the province, mainly to the liberals, who were then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for former deputy prime minister from the Liberal Party Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts in which the cost was overstated
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked unfailingly.
Gilles Surprinan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: for ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to trips, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey and bribe matches for a total of $ 736 000 in exchange for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he overstated.
Other officials responsible for road construction admitted that they received their paws, inflating accounts of 30-40% by means of fake additions.
Then one mayor’s party organizer, Martán Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party cash with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Trumble resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Roulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the district of Rivière de Prair in the east of the island, it is opposed to the sale of a municipal plot bought for $ 5 million and resold since 2010. 1.6 million developers in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually begin, it will “pull for a string that allows you to understand the functioning of the system teeming with ants to stop the gangrene and identify the perpetrators.”
This process it is characterized as “painful, but positive”.
We are in the process of cleaning the wound, but Montreal will need his own investigation team and observer to avoid the return of dubious practices.
How we get out at home.
Regularly.
Jacques Dusheno, for his part, notes that “officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,” but he is especially concerned about the role of “elective officials who knew about this scheme” but did not participate in the fraud.
Given that the share of dirty money in financing the election campaign in Quebec reaches 70%, he jokes: “I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The government of Quebec proposes to limit to $ 100 donations to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit the cost of elective spending, there will be dirty money in politics.”
It demands the complete restructuring of the system of granting state contracts and party financing: “We cannot fall below; boldly delving into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchenau calls on those who laugh to look into their own courtyard.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season you have achieved an extraordinary scale in PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be a new dimension of PSG.
Great players arrived.
I grow next to them every day.
Technical staff also brought a lot.
These factors make me raise my level of play every day.
And during the match, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not inflamed.
From the very beginning at the pre-preparation centre at the NIF in Klerfonten and before I came to Saint-Etienne, I have always stepped forward.
So you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti.
Replenishment of this summer is not new to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me wants to be at the level and give his best.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my positioning.
He is assisted by such deputies as Claude Makelela, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti is the owner of the situation?
Of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is among the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience, and he has won a lot of titles with high-end clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he'll bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I was moving away from a series of injuries.
The trust he gives me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the place of the leader from us.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we effectively qualified in the one-eighth final.
What is the club’s goal in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can be.
We can say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, to be able to host the return match in the eighth final.
Will PSG be able to become a top-notch European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for that...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate positions in the long term.
It's not like that today.
PSG has the financial means to make this project real.
Not taking the title in the First League, as last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to get this championship title.
We were close to it last season.
In May, there was a disappointment because we had everything to come to the finish line first.
It was a very good season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points assume the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marcel, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media expect too much from PSG?
It is normal that a lot is expected of us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Trua at home and we still find something to criticize, of course, it is a little frustrating.
We wonder what people expect from us first.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement the game.
The team is formed with time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who has not been able to go through the same eighth final for two seasons, even though they also spent a lot of money!
Given the invested amounts, we presented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
This would be a disregard for our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marcel, who were not on top last season, were “outgrew” by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, as a result we won.
PSG, it seems, completely depends on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
And what if they say that there is a certain "Zlatanodependence".
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves that he is the star of the First League.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he is a great player and a star of world scale.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching a little playing time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I gotten out of there stronger.
Today I manage to play good qualifying matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since I baptize Blue.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave exemplary.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the Blue?
They are effective for him.
He has good positions in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
What was Laurent Blanc.
But I wouldn't want to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us in the Euros.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will bring the Blue to Brazil.
A good deserved draw (1-1), torn out on October 16 in Spain - is this a fundamental match?
This match gave us faith in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Paying and selling without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current monetary exchange, based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as often happens to these technologies, it is obvious a political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonie), is also a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a secure BitTorrent-type exchange protocol that allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200 000 operations have already been registered with 15 000 computers in the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins to make donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin exchange rate, reaching a top of $30 (€23) in June 2011, five months later fell to $2 before returning to about ten dollars today (the rates are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing special in comparison with the world exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, became interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency”, “competing with the dollar or the euro” and “similar to conventional currencies”.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “loans” used to promote in a video game that are earned during the game or that can be bought (and sometimes exchange).
Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations always control and processes a central organ.
In Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously holders of the ledger, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users actually occurs between two email addresses, like email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to check what the bitcoins used in the transaction do exist in a public account book sent throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, receives a privilege to add this new line.
We are talking about the file hash phase, that is, the transformation of a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers "take" a new transaction and add a number to it before "hapch" all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (a lot of zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus turns out to be inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) would wish to pay twice the same topic with money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would be unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solved the problem receives 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award regularly shares in half, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to one hundred millionth, which leaves another reserve.
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
“The used defect does not apply to the protocol itself,” assures Pierre Noisa, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments with real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Large players such as Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the counting book and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant sales" were announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” Jone Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, who converts bitcoin into gold, rejoices.
Pierre Nuaz, another author of this currency manual, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to verify transactions, which is cheaper in this way.
The holder controls his personal data better and may thus be anonymous.
The system is simple in implementation for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough just to tell the address that can be “photoed and recognized” by phone, says Pierre Noise, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Betweden, before the firmware, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB in its report involves, by the way, revise the various risks considered elevated today, if the system succeed.
We left Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Capis and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain control over its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, without relying only on us.
We have suffered mainly Afghan peasants, whom we considered as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and maimed.
The Taliban is made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often from peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as was the case under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes they are helped by local rebels, but they will no longer be there as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijbla, which I observed from the height of the hills planted by almond trees thanks to French loans, was in order.
The convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, accompanied by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
Since the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed from the time of their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of the struggle between various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid for the obscurity of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved in our days.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the present Taliban are united in their desire to hold women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into dealers taking over state land to resell them for building to returnees from Iran and Pakistan, using huge U.Subcontract contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I heard in the countryside, want a government that would not consist of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will leave those who managed American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65 percent of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million people in Kabul, one-fifth of the total population.
Public schools in cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to ensure jobs for these young people, who will not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed fighters, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and who are watching everywhere.
There is an army at the moment.
The authorities that will command it will be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who led the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking measures to restore provincial squads that would not be subject to the central authority.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country, with strong local differences, should be to some extent decentralized, modelled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that has existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 50-ies, and even earlier, depends on foreign assistance.
The industry was not put on its feet, not a single dam is functioning, not a single irrigation system is repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country destroyed by thirty years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan has huge mineral resources.
This only increased the feeling that the Western countries were there only to take possession of them.
Without the energy for the processing of iron ore or copper on the spot, without means of transportation, there is no mining of minerals to export them through the mountains.
The Chinese have almost left the Mess Ainac region, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the largest employers of the province.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, should restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat units was completed on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the faculty of the French language at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural spheres, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to “conquer hearts and minds” and fulfill the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the service of “communic-combitory activities” under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the revolt: irrigation, wells, drinking water, forest restoration, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in the area of arable land.
What will we leave in memory of ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2 000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in Kapisa province.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, what farmers want, as they were told to me, we need to provide them with a small non-military support that would be well controlled and treated directly.
Severe births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky move by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever on the constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, he decided to play wa-bank.
After taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly a week ago, the head of state provided the Assembly with two additional months to finish the work.
Soon it is two years since Egypt is based on the preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic nonsense”, continuing to “violate this word” and “trampling the right”.
In the camp of his followers, they are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time that causes the Brothers to abandon the intention to explain the Egyptians text, the article for the article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent is raging across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote positively, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I reserve extraordinary powers”, which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to convey their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order for the necessary quorum to be reached, 11 people, spare participants, were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that in most cases the articles were voted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, was amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around... time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were wrong.
The text on which the vote was still going on yesterday consists of 234 articles.
The object of universal attention, article 2 has finally remained identical to an article in the 1971 Constitution, which states that “chariat principles are the main source of law”.
The Salafist parties, for which the introduction of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the “principles” with “rules”, which would make it possible to apply them more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Lyismeria,” the liberals answer, who see only PR in this.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
They pointed out, in particular, article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pomier, this is alarming. c. “People called for decision-making are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.”
We can observe the origin of theocracy.”
Many liberals are also excited about the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be much less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment there is no specific religious interference.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulomes, but people with university education, some studied in the French system,” says Alexis Bloe, who prepares a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “around Article 220 may arise ambiguousness, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to "fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence,] ed.
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which the civil judges are competent to make decisions about it.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is criticized because it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claim that they have decreased significantly compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will be held not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Also, the trial of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered to be disastrous for freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy has been retained, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for the freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles more speaks of the protection of a woman, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Nap Land and the sea from brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and pristine nature.
"AiF" identified the five most important reasons for visiting Israel.
Worship of the Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that on all who enter this "failure" descends God's grace.
And Galileo is the place of the wonders of Jesus: turning at a wedding water into wine, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all the shrines in Jerusalem.
Believers here are the Way of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony - Pretorium - where there was a trial, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulché on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Dough of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew, from which a cross was made to crucify Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, left over the temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70. N.E.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave here notes with desires, which are then fulfilled.
Make a trip vertically
The ruins of the fortress of Massada remained from a secret refuge from the enemies that Herod the Great built in 25 g. BC for his family.
They are located on the sheer cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them on their own.
The rest on this historical peak delivers a lift on the cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, on which in the winter months there is a huge influx of tourists.
To it from the foot of the mountain delivers a bus-shuttle.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to ancient legend, on the top of the mountain supposedly lived pagan gods.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go to everyone for one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500 thousand. Archaeological and Anthropological Exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
Its exposition is widely presented with canvases of Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Cysleigh, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the Al-Basé Ban, which is a few halls of ancient Turkish baths with dummies of visitors and bathrobes of the time.
In Caesarea, you should go to the unique private Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodina.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Entrance is free, and donations are not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - the children's memorial - is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
The stars are shimmering.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died sound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Healing
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the coasts of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, in the Red Sea swim even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and swimming there all year round.
By the way, this is the most extraordinary sea in the world is at the lowest point of the planet - 417 m below sea level.
Cote d'Azur water in it - brine, easily keeps afloat even do not know how to swim at all.
Landscapes around are unrealistically beautiful.
They come here to undergo treatment with salt water - rapture, and healing mud, and healing health for dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus to put the fragated nerves in order.
Touch the Mysteries of Antiquity
They are kept by an ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous Maritime Path, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived here for a long and happy life.
Tourists are very fond of wandering through the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of "your" sign, Fortune will become favorable.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries at a photo shoot.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of the Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The well-restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist for a note
Going to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $ 1. - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and in Haifa it is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower city with the Upper.
In fact, it is an underground funicular.
Travel in all modes of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can drive with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
And on Sunday morning begins the working week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes in which milk is combined with meat.
They offer a large selection of dishes of lamb and beef, soups and desserts, cooked on coconut milk, traditional Jewish paste hummus, a variety of sauces, ground chilled-nine balls - halal, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But a lot of fattened cats, which are valigatically "walk on their own".
In the evening they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murlyks love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost $ 37. (Hyundai Getz) up to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $ 15. in the day.
And the bike rental will cost 15 kilometers. in the day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Language of the numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most of all, citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and rest.
On the Promised Land from January to October 2012 visited 118.8 thousand. Ukrainian tourists, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
“Great and mighty” to Moscow will lead: migrants save money on the language
While deputies and human rights activists are arguing that will give a law on mandatory language testing, fraudsters who sell “fake” certificates have already appeared in the country
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to support families left at home.
From December 1, the law came into force, according to which every migrant worker will be obliged to pass an exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service, housing and communal services, household and retail trade.
However, over time, - promise in the FMS, - tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, you will have to pass not only the language, but also Russian history, and the basics of legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed for obtaining and for renewing a work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
People who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not covered by the law.
Benefits, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will work under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Peoples' Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass tests in all cities; already now more than 160 such centers have been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press a question: what, in fact, will it?
What will change the obligation to know the language for both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, representatives of the migration service respond, this will reduce the number of people suffering from “labour slavery”.
A lot of people are talking now about the protection of the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the representative office of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
Protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow to solve the problems of foreign workers by 90%.
Problems appear in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language that do not have a medical examination.
Without an understanding of the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of helping, will put him a “voucher” into a creepy cramped barracks, where he and dozens of his kind will languish without food and documents, working 12-14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“At home, they are promised one thing, and on arrival they are deceived, passports are taken, they do not pay the promised salary,” confirms Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Directorate of Labor Migration of the MC of the MC of Tajikistan.
Don't swear, nanny!
Nevertheless, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics, going to work in Russia, admit that not only do not know the language of the country in which they aspire, but also write with their own hands.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as a problem: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford even a sensible primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, not to mention decently dress, shoe and equip them to school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity go to work.
It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of the language, they admit.
"You feel humiliated and incomplete."
However, in relation to the law on the language, human rights defenders note one important point.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Outsiders are forbidden"
Many of the visitors claim that it is not so easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is in bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we mainly have false documents, there is no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
“They ask a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,” said Umed Khushkadamam, a citizen of Tajikistan, with journalists.
"Fly, not a bite, buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on the language, it turned out that not only migrant documents on registration were false.
Several “fake” certificates of passing language tests have already been seized by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not for nothing: each of the migrants, who hoped to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than twice as expensive as the procedure of official testing: it will cost an employment migrant three thousand.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that the “crusts” could not be simply bought, both government and human rights activists converge.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who have not been able to successfully pass the test the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes with the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law in relation to the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Press shots at weddings when there were no casualties, and the massacre, arranged by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, as a result of which seven people were killed.
Police want to ban the wearing of injuries in public places and raise the age at which you can get a license for weapons - from 18 years to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by “tightening the screws”.
An open letter appeared on the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand to abandon the "meaningless tightening."
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, said the Russian service of the BBC lawyer-forensicist Vasily Lesnikov.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, for six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered with the internal affairs bodies, while in just the same period, 1168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not put the criminal to go to the “black” market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims that they are monitoring the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is replenished through several channels.
There are five main such channels, says retired Colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff for ten years.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is “army or military trail”, that is, the weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“Weapons were dragged by both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon" - stolen by criminals from representatives of law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes both warehouses carried away from police officers and stolen from law enforcement officers directly.
Illegal "trunks" go on sale from military warehouses.
There were often explosions in many military warehouses.
“There are proven versions that some of the arson were made specifically – to cover the shortage,” says the former military.
Their contribution, according to Barants, is being paid to arms manufacturers.
“Now private arms factories are bred, which do not withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia was formed, which organized the flow,” the former military explains.
Where's the gun coming from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate fraction of each of the sources of illegal weapons on the “black” market.
The report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Management Design.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data of portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were found there “out of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are embezzlement at the stage of arms production, 5% are accounted for by “black archaeology”.
The salesman-consultant of one of the arms stores, who asked not to be named, assures that the weapon found by black diggers has not been buying for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, for the new batch, sellers go to a military warehouse.
Through the warrant officer, a person buys a unit, for example, a TT pistol.
He is discharged, passed through the fence.
“He transports her to the city and here sells 900 euros apiece with two stores,” he says.
“True, the police are aware of all cases, so periodically when the crime detection plan is burning, they carry out a control purchase from merchants with illegal weapons,” the consultant adds.
"Like a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, in blogs, until I responded to a comrade who offered to come to the "Tegg" platform, where there will be a person who will take me to the "corner", where we will bargain.
The price of the trunk I only found out there
Military Columnist Victor Baranets
To get a trunk, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but there also need to come, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to tell that the daughter had a tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of castes now through the man I'm sure of.
He's only supplying them to me too because he knows I won't turn him in.
Beginners are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990’s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The schemes, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album with photos where there was "anything."
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” recalls the military.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, don't just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, there are targeted.
“I am given the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon hits well, we begin to bargain,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet bring to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
This does not require any documents or personal meetings.
“It is enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the advertising cap on the website “Buy a combat pistol or a machine gun”.
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will the minors be sold?
“Without a license of course,” asks the user “Ivan” (the spelling is saved).
"I will buy TT.Moscow" - concisely formulates the request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now spread a huge network of fake sites and those wishing to buy a combat weapon rowing with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish for bait, and then extract coal in Siberia
Military Observer and Former Military Victor Baranets
I have heard about such schemes: the site is usually registered outside the operation of Russian laws.
People accept orders.
The buyer makes a payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send a photo and instructions where weapons are hidden,” says Dmitry Kislov, a spokeswoman for the Right to Weapon.
Victor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the site, you can be left without weapons and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now spread a huge network of fake sites and those wishing to buy a combat weapon rowing with a shovel.
“People go like a hungry fish for bait, and then extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $ 100
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can meet from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the organization “Right to weapons”, the Makarov pistol can be purchased for $ 100-300.
You'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from the warehouses of long-term storage by the management of these warehouses of the middle level.
According to the official statistics of the department, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, fast food and supermarket workers are striking
Through work at the McDonald’s box office passes up to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy and Kentucky Fride Chicago, have swapled in America.
So far, no one is to predict whether this wave will turn into a ninth shaft or it is destined to exhale in the early stages.
The shares are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising modest salaries received by ordinary Walmart employees and fast food systems, the goal of the organizers of the protests is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday”, when America was hit by an orgy of cheap sales, which captured millions of ordinary people and sometimes accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, which employs 2.2 million people around the world, left their jobs and picketed together with unions and left-wing activists, the corporation’s stores, whose merchandise is designed for people of humble and medium-sized wealth.
Walmart trades everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in its stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-wage Walmart employees are only at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell the goods to cheapery in part because he pays little to its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the “Black Friday” demanded to raise wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $ 30 to 100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee, who receives $9.5 an hour, this expense is not affordable, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $ 12 per hour, it will cost the corporation $ 3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than she spends on a salary now.
If Walmart completely shifts the growth of salaries on the shoulders of buyers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more expensive.
For the year they will spend on some $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters quite note that the protests took place in just nine states and did not cause the corporation to do not cause the corporation any amount of damage.
Black Friday continued in her shops from 8 p.m. on Thursday afternoon to midnight the next day, and during that time Walmart sold about 5000 goods per second.
In total, her cash registers produced almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
A spokesman for the corporation, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that jobs had left in total “less than five” Walmart employees, and that the protest was just another “another PR trick” of the trade union that organized it.
"Free cashier!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were not Walmart department stores (they are not favored in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), and McDonald’s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says he's selling billions of servings, and after that he doesn't even give you sick leave and doesn't pay you for a fair job!
Jumain Williams, member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York, is 7.25 per hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not much, and on average, their employees get $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one earns less of them in this expensive city.
How to live in New York with such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once through the "McDonald's" there were almost a quarter of American teenagers who worked for their shelves after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now I am constantly talking about an interview with McDonald’s employees, who complain that they should live on this salary and sometimes even feed children for it.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum, there is a commentary whose author notices that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them to.
Protesters, who began at 6.30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs start paying at least $15 an hour, more than double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be established in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from preventing and punishing activists of the trade union movement with quibbles and dismissals.
On the other hand, the administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult to cover the trade union with rapid food for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary turnover of personnel.
Dissenters
Noisy protests took place on this day and a number of other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action was in the middle of the day rally near the Times Square, which was made by several local Democratic politicians, in particular, a member of the city council Jumain Williams, who said: McDonald’s says that it sells billions of servings, and after that he does not even give you sick leave and does not pay you for honest work!”
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as Mayor’s candidate Bill De Blacio, who said that “we must join in support of fast food workers in order to achieve fair pay and economic well-being that every New Yorker deserves!”
As described by the New York Times, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food sector.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, and not all of them were workers of fast catering, in which tens of thousands of people are employed in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will generate a mass movement.
"While cheating the brain is average"
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the theme of augmented reality recently is accepted mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, at its annual conference, the current model showed Google, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was filed by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at the Microsoft Cambridge laboratory, Sharam Izadi shows that for scientists of this company glasses are a passed stage.
They are beckoned by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell us, please, in general, what does your research team do?
- We are engaged in human interaction with machines, but at the same time we try to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity is mostly stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking in them with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate drastic changes in this interaction.
For example, Xbox and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is not for sale without Kinect, because it is interesting for everyone to gesture control.
- What's next ahead of us?
- Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, much still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
Entering information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not so good yet.
We are trying to change this, we are working on a truly three-dimensional display systems based on a variety of technologies, including design.
We need to release the computer world into our physical, physical, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid helmets of virtual reality!
- What do you think about voice control?
It’s a popular thing, but isn’t it overestimating it?
- It is definitely not called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to notify others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in its niche.
For example, to manage devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought of gestures, but not over sweeping, but over such stingy, short.
At the same time, gestures were removed not by the camera of the device, but by a handheld bracelet, which recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
So far, it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future belongs to the mixed type of management, for example, gesture + voice.
- Is that what?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this soda jar?
You will say and show at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it'll be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to get users to adapt to what the machine can or can't do at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine the human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, it is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Do you lack permission, depth or something else?
In principle, the current generation is what can be started in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 k / s.
But it’s not about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds to the work of the designers of algorithms.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the permission according to the axes of X and Y, but also Z.
Also very important speed, number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 k/s is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Betises from our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much it affects the interaction of humans and machines.
I would very much useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, but does not require touches so that the frames per second would be larger.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second - the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
A potential greater number of cameras could solve the problem.
Or aggravate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the curvature of the camera and see how this will help in the three-dimensional determination of the position.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not give the public its points.
Don’t you think that from the point of view of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time to walk, holding the smartphone in the raised hands, not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transparent" augmented reality, when on the basis of a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and further everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (private things see only you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics often point to such an idea: there is no tactile review!
Hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction of a person and machine.
I think the eighth may well be a supplement of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
She's a great job of pressing!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these "pictures in the air" of tact - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic rays at a certain point where the finger is located, gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you were blew on the pads.
There are bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to cheat the brain?
Make him think he feels like he should feel at the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried to do that yet.
There is another task that will be fought for a long time - how to make a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is walking on an open, almost endless - we are also working on the concepts of treadmills (not really like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge balls.
While cheating the brain is average, work is still very much longer.
That's what makes working on a virtual reality so attractive to a researcher - many things in an absolutely infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already got bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" - shocking artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Cyril Miller - a bearded man dressed in all red, who is found at the Russian Museum, then at the Summer Garden, then on fashionable parties and vernissages.
The paintings of Cyril Miller always gather crowds of spectators wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical storytellers, creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's - the early 90's.
In addition, he is a man of the city, his appearance on the streets causing a smile among the towns, lifting everyone in the mood.
Recently, he took the charmanka and became a St. Petersburg sarch man, as he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why do you still walk around the city in everything red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the color red as a fashion designer, engaged in view and image.
In this world, the color red is a compromise between an artist, an image maker and a society.
Although in society everything that is slightly less gray, causes aggression and excitement of an unkind property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting the conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in the DC Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew it was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the postgazonevshchina, which led to Pushkin-10, and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into the theater, clothes, music, in all genres, except the word.
- And it all came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkin-10, and there, until there was repair, there was a music and arthistic club, a bohemian club, a house of St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOUH, Tequila Jazz, I remember the Schnura brought with the project "Earth of Van Gogh".
The cord and his friends sang light songs under the plywood, they were in a tight tight, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played alive, it became Leningrad.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs before Chali-Galivian times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received his basic education and upbringing.
Gallery "D 137", the club "Mriboyedov - these are echoes from the Art Clinic.
Our employees and regulars are gone there.
I was a hero of yesterday, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
In the nomination "The Artist of the Year" I was named, my culmination ended.
In new times, according to the old rules, it is inconvenience to work, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
Nowadays, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your works are characterized by a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, "Russian Museum in Clowns".
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being like this is painful and scary.
But in the clowns everything is smeared, the tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian dressing in an orderly manner.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on external mechanics, and not on the inner man.
And maybe you can't give him a hand and you need to spit on his face.
And the deception will be removed with the help of changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you as a city shamster. - The cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, it is.
- Maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be careful, tactical, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
Previously, people stumbled in flocks, one bohemian loved one, after all, another thing.
Now everyone has crashed into microcoms, now it is difficult for everyone to like it.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper to please everyone.
Now we have to think about who will like.
Now every cult hero has 100 fans.
- And Stas Mikhailov comes several thousand!
- Brorredsters come to him, there the sex and social sphere works.
And on cultural grounds 300 people will come, and 10 thousand. will not come, and in the end less management, money, everything will wither.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the gain.
In my youth, I wrote such pictures that one collector they were on the wall next to Falk and Larionov hanging.
I started with paintings that are usually finished.
Concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of culture of yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of drawing paintings.
I am for this culture.
- Kirill, what is the lack of St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: an official from culture.
But not every one of them can do culture.
Under the right kings, everything was not so, the kings may not have been very aware of the culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
Moscow is good consultants.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed, as we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and give them the way.
The taste is thriving.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is Pitt for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow there is much more culture, there is soil.
And on our stones it is difficult to grow the art.
We need cultural soil, and we have more writers now than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this layer of little end.
We need to make fashion art as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented at the expense of the grant of St. Petersburg
Birth in Space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with an asteroid killer.
Caravans of spacecraft with earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
To preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue its kind in conditions of weightlessness or on the same reserve planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"This is Venus and Mars," - said a senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg (GAISH) Vladimir Surdin.
But if on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus. in space.
Approach the questions of reproduction in space began from the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the in orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophil.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how the embryo develops in zero gravity.
We get an absolutely normal chick at the exit.
Then the problem begins.
“The problem associated with the fact that this chick must find a support, he must stand on his feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Not finding support, the chicks cried indiscrimen.
And after 10 hours, newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
And there was a problem that four days later they just died.
“And twice we hatched the chicks, after that refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” says the failure of the experiment with chicks in space Vladimir Sychev.
With animals, the last time a biological "Minister" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, on the biosatebU "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space with the fruit.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
“It was just on biosatellites, but again it is an isolated experiment, and such studies should be carried out,” notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But it is not possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space yet.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing, habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova was the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is a female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it will survive after a flight into space.
Will she be able to have a child after this flight?
“No one answered this question,” says Vakhtang Vachdadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolaev was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, who twice visited the orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are some astronauts, who after long flights everything went well, and a healthy generation is growing.
“And if more, it is dangerous even during orbital flights,” concludes the pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new paths in biotechnology, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrolaboratory CPC is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in the conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts practice their skills in outer space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still an alien environment, then for infant children - native element.
Little ichthyandrs seem to confirm that life on land has come out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months in the mother in the end-used liquid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bathing, takes only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget something,” says infant voyage instructor Marina Aksenova.
In short, if for a born child a weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman - gravity, gravity, gravity is necessary.
Very quickly in weightlessness, the abdominal muscles, the pelvis decrepit, the ability to push the fetus decreases.
All right, let's put this down, relying on stimulants of labor.
You can, of course, in a special cell to give birth, she will push him out.
"And what's next?" - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Not feeling earthly attraction, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
Newborn in orbit is impossible, like an adult, to wear a special loading suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what will be vital to him.
“And this experiment, which we will go to, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring a disabled person to Earth, a completely maladjusted person,” foresees the head of the bioethics committee of the IMDP of the Russian Academy of Sciences Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while, this will be a reality when earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet that will be home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main Control and Audit Department: The inspection of the Schwartz system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement industry, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the availability of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice President of the Supreme Control and Audit Department, from an interview for the website Aktuálně.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we do not have enough,” Kala commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of improper practice, Peter Necz’s approach to the so-called Schwartz system leads.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - does it go beyond or allowed?
“The law should be in any way established, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of institutions that are charged with the obligation to verify and enforce obligations,” says Kala.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you talked about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, within the framework of which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This is a parallel test that we started, probably two years ago.
Simply put, European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out, followed by national legislation and then also applied in practice.
All information was collected and, even with an unfinished inspection, interesting differences were found - more simply, the legislation can be "accurate and unmistakable", but in the practice of application we give in some respects to Germany.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more refined rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project really help you what it means to you?
It is this joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the appropriate thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the order limit.
Perhaps this system will be overflowed by “paper” so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction did not decrease.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our CRU (Overvision and Audit Management) or does it work differently?
As for the institutions, Bundesschnungshof, arranged according to our principle, also exists as our CRU, which works in a slightly different way, but basically both institutions function in a similar way.
In addition, the powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units and at the level of the federal states - this is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can manage only federal money, we have public funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal office.
As for local legislation, is it easier there than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be said that it is better in everything.
That's true because they're better at handling?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I don't like such comparisons.
But I must say that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't have got any advantage from working with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendment to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, somehow the consequences appear?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet manifest itself in our work to control.
Since we control the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we have begun to use our new tool "detecting the risk of economics", through which we drove through almost 14000 state contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will be manifested, because the restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders and so on change.
Do you think the adoption of this law will benefit or an additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will “tighten” and they cannot be observed.
In the operation of previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (e.g. regional operational programmes - with the regional council) in the fact that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think that's the way.
The system must exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let’s be aware that this path will not lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called Schwartz system. What does that mean?
Is the "Schwarz-system" prohibited or permitted?
The law should be in any way established, and if it prohibits something, the Prime Minister cannot resist the work of the authorities charged with verifying and seeking the fulfilment of obligations.
We can say: “We will change this law and allow it,” but we can’t say that we will pretend that nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains rather strict rules, how and what should be formally carried out, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it should be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and snowy.
They are mostly passable, but in some places with more caution.
Karlovy Vary
This morning in the Karlovy Vary area were passable roads, but in some places frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day should gradually warm up.
Snowfall in the region stopped, only in the lowlands lies a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Ore Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was a lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 high-speed highway and first-class roads in the region are currently passing without restrictions.
However, attentiveness is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain trails, are passable.
But on some of their sites there are still the remains of frozen and sometimes drunken snow.
Particular attention should be on the roads located on the hills.
Pardubic and Královegradetsky Krai
The management of roads and highways of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads of the eastern Czech Republic face ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on the hills, can be a dried layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about ice, which can be formed especially on the hills of the Pardubitsky Territory.
Ice can be near Lanshkrona, Usti nad Orlitia, Little Grin, Svitavi or Visoke Mito especially on the roads of the second and third class.
Roads I/43 and I/34 located at the victim are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkonoshe and Orlitsky Mountains.
The riding layer of snow is located on the roads located on the hills in the areas of Rikhnov nad Kneznhou and Trutnova.
In the Eastern Czech Republic today is variable cloudiness without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Pilsen Territory
Roads in the Pilsen region this morning are passable, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is frosty, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
Places drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now almost without restrictions, however, the road managers recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most of the roads of the first class have a dry and frozen surface.
In the southern Pzlzy and Takhov can be caught frozen areas.
Second and third-class roads are wet, and in this case there is a warning due to the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on low-used roads in the Sumy area.
Olo-outk Krai
Drivers heading to the elevations of the Olomouk Territory should take into account the snow porridge on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogresky saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlsky Krzyzh.
At night, the snowfall forced road workers to go out, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other areas of the edge, the roads are usually passed without restrictions.
“The remains of snow are on the hills of Schumper.
Drivers heading towards Yeselik should keep in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenograssky saddle, ”said today CHAN (Czech News Agency) dispatcher of the Supersky Roads control.
At night, their colleagues from Yessenik also went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after processing with chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, roads pass without restrictions, but in Sternber, drivers should be attentive to forest areas where humidity is still maintained.
Ustesky Krai, Liberetsky Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia reported that there are several difficult passages.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or fallen snow, a mountain road on the site from Telnica on Klintice in the Ustecki Territory is closed.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice are preserved on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - it was raining all day and snow melted, at night the sky cleared up and frosts began.
It is reported about the unfavorable conditions on the main highway and on the highway I/13 on the border of Ustytsky and Liberetsky Territory.
Due to the branches of the trees curved under the layer of snow, the branches of the road related to the road were forced to close the road to Telnica on Knicnica.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about that in less than a month the end of the world should come?
It’s just one of the many alarming news that we humans are so easily caught on.
Together with The Tap Tap, we constantly joke about this and say that we are the only group in the world that can collect enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you tell readers more about this?
We are talking about a nationwide fundraising event, which we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar has, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20, at 21:00, three concerts will start in parallel in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, the time zone of which will end 12 hours earlier than we have, the May calendar.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially, it was my idea, then we all came up with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think, together with the public, to think about the state of this world we will one day convey to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be purchased on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus also support us.
The band The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
Will the anthem that has already loved YouTubeists at these benefits concerts will be performed?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything will work out and the end of the world will not come.
It will be sung by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be played live in Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video Tomasz Ganak, participates in the performance of Xindl X.
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the return from the concert against the end of the world?
For the purchase of equipment for the STUDEO barrier-free educational center, for the sixth year we have been working with the civil association of Tap at the Jelchki Institute.
Teachers regularly attend students of the schools of the Institute of Julčki and hold with them fun and interesting events.
The students themselves have no means to go to the teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity.
Within the framework of the project of additional construction of the Institute of Julichka in the future, a building will arise separately, to which we will move with this project.
At each concert there will be several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to make a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with DAN Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suhi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grand activities” in the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the festival "Prague Spring" and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would be happy to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we were in the United States, I would very much like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
About abroad you have serious plans, you have already played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you deal with the road from the point of view of organization and logistics??
It’s not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large number of cargo and boxes with tools.
However, so far, they have coped with this without any problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airways Airlines have always been excellent for us, which surprised me how many times.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went without problems.
Thanks to traveling abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations to persons with disabilities and so on.
What have you faced by now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything is functioning better than ours, in Russia we have seen that in the east it is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and here is still the outlandish movement of a person in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, there are no such banal things as to give way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already public organizations that try to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And what, on the contrary, we must constantly catch up with advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of execution is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who concern it.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with a severe form of disability move independently on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, anywhere.
There is not very common the fact that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-free is one thing, but at the moment when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers will appear among us, then everything will really begin to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but back two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I entered the Judlicki Institute as a teacher, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I myself am a musician and play, including on the saxophone, together with my colleague he organized an interesting musical circle.
Well, over time, as our presenter Lada Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
This is true, we were helped by the fact that we began to join the famous singers and actively work on the propaganda of the group.
We came to the conclusion that a job that no one can assess, is essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Did you have a goal so well to promote The Tap Tap?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that imitate one another.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, is natural.
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all abandoned personalities that we should regret.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities do something, it is a shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Has the success of you are a strict leader, as many people think you are?
If we want to do the work qualitatively, we must be in many things uncompromising and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they learn that twice a week they should go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
Currently, the group The Tap Tap is twenty people.
How many were there in early 1998?
Only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have willpower and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 bands and other musicians of the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference at the time of the performance of the song of the group The Tap Tap "The End of the World is Cancelled".
The goal of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kroner for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edlicki Institute in Prague.
A concert ticket costs 400 kroner, for children under 12 years old admission is free. Tickets can be purchased in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and for the following years took an active part in a number of projects of the agency.
But the path to space Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights to space, but this did not always meet with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, the lecture A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented in the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory ideas from his pioneering work "Introduction to Cooperatives".
Ideas of a Young Engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Ence-Peltree Prize and André Luis Hirsch for Introducing Cosmonautics.
Dr. Jan Gadomskie (1899-1966), which was mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski became a world-renowned space propagandist, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925, a railway tribe equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a missile was to be used to disperse or for braking the trolley.
Information about this tyre is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Arms Engineering Section in cooperation with Professors Mecislav Wolfk and Gustav Mokzyk.
From the surviving materials it can be seen that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of the German troops, the work was interrupted.
In 1937, the intended printing appeared the idea of a photovoltaic fighter rocket, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, and the next year the work of the Air Torpedo and the Air Rocket-Bomb Aircraft by Levilya-Kvizhiblobitsky was released.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war, all the projects of military use of missile technology were carried out by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczaowy Komitet Doradzo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of its activity, the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Astronautics Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, the society is mentioned in the November issue of 1954 of the magazine "Problems", which publishes four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that will deal with space exploration.
At that time, projects of artificial satellites were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research is a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) has tried to join the international federation of astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn of POA became a full member.
And the following year, the first chairman of the POA, Kazimierz Zarankevich (1902 - 1959), became deputy chairman of the International Astronautics Federation.
In this position he remained until his death, which came in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of the very successful RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna) meteorological rocket, which became the first Polish missile to carry out a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The rocket, capable of covering a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 missile was tested on the Bledovsky Darylum.
This missile was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 missile could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The heir to the first RM missiles was a Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was conceived as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A missile had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1V - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1S - 0.62l.
The maximum flight range of all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor 2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a starting weight of 380 kg was able to bring a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then the Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the national committee of COSPAR two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercostorium after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the law on public works.
The ruling caused a lively discussion in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this problem from a broader point of view.
Liberally-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In fact, this means that individual economic subdivisions, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and free, unlimited movement of private capital along with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages), price voltage occurs.
By this concept, you need to understand a state where the manufacturer, through the delivery of a cheap commodity, tries to withstand economic competition by “throws” the value of a competitor in order to take a larger part of the market and, thus, increase its own income.
On a massive scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either to move production abroad, either cheap purchases abroad or extinction. As a result, unemployment is increasing in those in countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including the unemployment of unemployment, the unimposing expenditure of the state for social needs is increasing.
In general, the situation increases the reluctance of the masters of entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that specific statistics should not be provided.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create a situation at the level of economies of individual states, when governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population to private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The goal is to economically force their people to obey the dictates of private capital, primarily in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the case of prolonged unemployment and at the same time serves as an instrument for curtailing the rights of workers in the field of labor legislation.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany for several years there has been a public distribution of products to the poor, which are not able to feed themselves with their own work.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra in order for them to receive a subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all southern EU states undoubtedly lead to the same condition in which people who are under pressure from a catastrophic fall in social status are forced to either emigrate, as it was in the 19 th century, or to exist on a beggarly salary on the margins of society in the hope that someday private investment capital will come to the country.
However, the question is, where will he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, as the Chinese, Hindu, Brazilian, Turks, Moroccan, Egyptian, African still works for a share of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media state steaddle that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, which the managed economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere with the governing actions in the economy.
Next, it is necessary to answer the question, whether private capital is not acting, now practically managing policy and the whole state, for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
Proof is the existence of almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobby in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation manifested in corruption, ensuring mutual benefit, in legislation, where almost everything is punishable, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the development of bills to private law firms that are closely associated with industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-type constitution says, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly found in such a situation as described by Appian in the work “The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompey”: “The state has been disintegrating for a long time, and the departments are engaged in violence.
Bribes, illegal receipt of favors with the help of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the polls with a pre-sold voice. .. “We have seriously begun to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is the autocracy and the need to choose a vibrant man.” Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it was Caesar, who finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer essentially intended for public use.
The current result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper character.
So the cause of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes, we must seek in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19 and 20 centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the law on public works is not a solution or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both the international and national and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share participation of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing will come of violence, and can never come out" - Sting, the song "Fragile", where the main verse of the refrain is the words: "Do not forget how fragile we are."
“If my sons didn’t want war, they would not have been” is the dying Gutel Schnaper, Meer’s wife, Amschel Rothschild.
The last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has sparked many responses.
Some support Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that by the Israeli state’s racism, a genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the Israeli state is credited with the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to think about who in these recurring waves of killings are a criminal, and who is the victim, after all, today's citizens of Israel, including self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and have not witnessed the beginning of violence.
My goal is to offer readers to look after the curtain, to see who is primarily the current tension (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land of the Middle East.
Some of my arguments are reinforced by historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or which group of people is the main engine of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily the history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - whether these people always taken their steps completely independently, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to predetermined goals.
It should be assumed that we live in a period when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several persons, and that this concentration of money and the power flowing out of them could not have happened in the life of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families stands out one, which could be considered as the head of the octopus (I don’t know if anyone is standing above them, but this is not excluded) – Rothschilds.
They don’t write a lot about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) as early as the 1990s, to end the rumors that linked their name to criminal actions in the higher realms in which they were in the shadows, and which always led to the strengthening of their power, the increase of wealth, or both.
They have large stakes in almost all central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan, there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi, only four remained, but at the same time the Russian government took its country’s central bank into its own hands).
Anyone who has tried to resist this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to produce his own (understand government) money and was killed in the theater in 1865.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to cancel the FED (the federal reserve system), was killed in 1963. Deputy Luis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the great Major Level 33 Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction of the world population to about 0.5-1 billion. A person (such a number of slaves will be sufficient to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they will not consume many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism can be nothing but a prerequisite for such a project) and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, is to challenge the crisis and the subsequent proposal of decisions (order ab chao - order of chaos).
But these decisions are fake and always lead to a deterioration of the situation (see. the FED base, which was to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907.
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, unwarranted and economically surrender of Germany (no longer there was a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European Power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the unleashing of the Second World War, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, superimposing huge military reparations on Germany, which created a premise for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only to throw the Germans a sufficiently strong, rebuke, and offering simple decisions of the Chief, further creating a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was supposed to play, and really played the function of the fifth column, while firing the war.
At the end of the 19 th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to create a Jewish state, preferably in the field of the historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a premise for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
Terrorist attacks occurred on both sides.
World War II broke out, it is difficult to estimate whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by bankers, or everything he did, was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War 2, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war of the third.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of hostilities on the front line, now, together with the Arab or, more simply, Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only inside the country, but also at the international level (take only a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim of a Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment generates resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers slip people to vote exclusively on their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister of Israel, the Hashiel, Netanyahu’s typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran’s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to escalate into a global conflict, and given Iran’s control over the Strait of Hormuz, containing 20% of the world’s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles).
In what light is the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order.”
The new world order in their representation is the world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted at birth with a chip with which it becomes a creature under total control.
And makes all the small, the mighty, rich and poor, free and slaves, and to have a stamp on his right hand or forehead, so that a man who is not marked in the name of that beast, or by the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
That’s what wisdom is, everyone who has a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
"Operation Argo": When there is nowhere worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist demonstrators captured the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the U.S. revolution, who had been the patron saint of his regime for decades.
For the US administration, there was no positive outcome of the situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, it was not able to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by an unsuccessful attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations through the mediation of the Algerian government.
Their fate caused the houses a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments.
The defeat in Iran largely contributed to the defeat of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult vicissitudes, they finished their journey at the residence of the Embassy of Canada.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to take them out of Iran, with an extravagant organ of cover, according to which they went on Canadian passports as members of the crew, looking for a place in the country for the filming of a science fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, which was invented by the expert on “evacuation” Tony Mendes, demanded cooperation between Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be reliable, in specialized magazines it was written about the project of the film, press conferences were arranged, a fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation for a long time kept secret, the film, based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "film-cinepas", the story of a successful idea, a scam - an example can be a number of films about Owsen's friends.
The film constantly changing moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (credits show iconic historical photos of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood passages intersecting with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in costumes discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck managed to make a career restart.
From the ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his game ceased to be the object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" his third feature film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and Thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film, which is not shot in the director's hometown - Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that elevated earlier films of the director over the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows this in Argo, where Tehran is “playing” Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, during the reconstruction of real events - the introductory scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when the story suddenly changes somewhere suddenly.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in the stages of fictional (fake headquarters at the Tegeran Bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes thinks something - all this does not go so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at the airport of Tehran, and the pursuit of the runway looks quite far-fetched).
The disadvantage of Argo is the lack of distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck’s film lacks a bit of drama, a film that can be watched with moderate interest, evaluating the production and retro style, reassigning the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to get involved.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in a certain sense of living history, as well as to testimonies to how the ideas about the omnipotent and omniscient special services are exaggerated.
Rules of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.banknovipopalky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank fees, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd decree or a project from the EU workshop.”
“We were prompted by this latest event in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” Patrick Nagerer, the organizer of the questionnaire, told Pravda.
Among the absurdities already nominated for the nomination is the recent decision of the European Court to combine the rates of insurance premiums for men and women.
Until now, women have had life insurance benefits because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can put people for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will be held until the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The controversial EU orders include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result is harmful to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substances, or a cell size directive for chickens, as a result of which this year significantly increased eggs.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "sand-traw oil" or the withdrawal from sale of classic light bulbs.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a particular commercial or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (in this way, the Czech Republic is now even under threat, defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, bananas of the highest quality in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show “abnormal curvature”.
At the same time, the European Commission was justified by the fact that only harmonizes the existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, has relaxed the standards for fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives will lead to waste products.
The candidate for winning in the survey may be last year’s EU regulation, according to which the balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under eight years of age cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to U.S. studies that play balloons are a potential cause of death for children by suffocation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under 14 years of age, who are forbidden to blow into fair covers.
Funny ideas are born and at home
The rule concerning the European officials themselves is absurd: everyone who has any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, but should instead say “FYYRM” (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists, the Laissez Faire, proposed for voting, in addition to the above-mentioned absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food stocks in the territory of the member state.
The EU has established the maximum amount of food reserves that can be located in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened by a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for the fact that they do not have the sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for an application for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation,” then-Armas Minister of Agriculture Yaroslav Palas (CESDPO) said in the autumn of 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of so-called interventional procurement, the state had complete stock stocks that had to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic by organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that are landlocked.
Subsidies for obtaining a subsidy were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Nemz (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to go to a statement for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre orders are an exception
Although regulations in member states are easily criticized, EU’s regulatory efforts, as well as the more effective functioning and development of the European Union, according to many experts, deserve recognition rather.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the shaking of EU grants for projects that do not even have a hint of anything in common with the deepening of European integration, but that member states have achieved during the discussion of the budget.
It is also emotional among the Czechs that, as in other EU countries, the Czech Republic should fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians retained the name "Olomoutsk cheeses", but "Temese rum", the traditions of which in our country go back to the 19 century, our manufacturers were to rename the "Tuzemak".
Only can be called rum can only be products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous cheeses "feta" and "Gorgondzola", marzipan from the German Lübeck or Parma ham, already found themselves, for example, Karlovy Vary crackers, pogorzhellitsky and Troshbonian carp and Zhatetsky hops.
Also, the EU trademark can be proud of the pardubian gingerbread and Gorzhy straws.
People want me to protect the republic, but I am an amateur, - says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head of running for president?
I'm not thinking of becoming a senator or president.
If everything in our country functioned without problems, then I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch as the country has been plundering over the past 20 years, how thieves are fused, people are raised by taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a solution for how to change it.
And since I have already turned forty years old and I am an independent person who is not one of any party, I have no other way to influence things but to run for a senator or president.
You got to the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Aren’t you turning your back in this way on the people who have chosen you?
I kept saying that I would be involved in the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the result of the Senate elections.
Later I clarified that if I am elected a senator, I will run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool with which I can exercise my views.
So I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we murmur like a nation in our bar or at the TV, but at the same time are ready to trample anyone who tries to change something.
To this are added the media that denigrate a person, and who confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, they said about me that I was giving bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Parowbek.
Let’s move on to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle you began with the theses about the material and criminal liability of politicians and on the return property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You do not have such powers as president, and only a whole Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I lobbied as a citizen to ensure that the tours became a free business, it was possible to advance.
The problem is politicking – when someone comes with a good offer left or right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this restrains citizens.
As an independent non-partisan person, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take every party settling on the shelves, without looking at the dogmas, I can take from each party what is best for our country, and apply it.
Do you consider yourself a person who is more related to the right or to the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people refer me rather to the left.
It doesn’t matter to me at all – a little left or a little to the right.
It is important for me to move forward.
It’s not that someone is about the right, but someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any good solution for society whether it will offer HRCM or GDP, and I will also oppose a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And you're trying to get closer to that.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or they are spoken by prominent experts.
But without the support of the parliament, you will only have slogans.
And with this in politics you will not last long.
Or do you think that when you come out to people and talk to them, will you be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to lure them to their side so that we achieve ours.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast, in which I will appeal to the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, if refused, will have to tell you why they do not want it.
If there is a strong person who voices abuses, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take direct presidential election - it was a merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am a fan, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am only a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I try to promote things on my own; in the event that it fails, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
This sounds part as if Okamura must save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a savior.
I know I won't do anything alone, so I've beat a number of famous people with a proposal to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused in connection with the large amount of work.
I also also supported the investigative journalist Yana Lorentsova, who disclosed fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel myself on the scales.
Sixty percent of people did not go to the polls, and most of those who went to choose representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us in the Senate.
People have chosen the Senate so that the changes will be difficult to do.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking of the foundation of your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to check the purity of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money for it.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account only twenty thousand crowns.
You don't have any money?
You talk about property declarations, but how are your own business with this?
Personal property is estimated at about 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, a collection of works of art for about 10 million, Aston-Martin for 3.5 million and Skoda Superb for a million, and a few million more on account.
By the way, Aston-Martin showed up because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, had a gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive on Aston Martin, own property for 60 million and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to get into debt?
I have invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors indicates that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my own pocket.
The cost of the campaign will actually cover the senatorial salary.
But with this money, I would not live, for example, could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand monthly.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run anywhere.
So, then you will continue to engage in entrepreneurship so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut this?
But it does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activities.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like to be a disinfected person who would keep the republic.
But I also need to live on something.
How many, as an entrepreneur, are you used to receive monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further.
And if I had become president, I would have finished my entrepreneurship.
You will find a full interview on Saturday's issue of the newspaper "Right".
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Spikenisse and its newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“It seems to me that building seems fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lisette Verheig, a passerby on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermont, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, said: "No, this building is really beautiful."
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Speykenisse, a unremarkable sleeping town near Rotterdam, owns an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and build seven fictional bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of picturesquely painted miniatures made of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the fathers of the city realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Viny Maas from the Rotterdam Architecture MVRDV, a master of bold column diagrams and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical buildings, treated the task with his usual equanimity and appeared at a competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the jury members were puzzled and shrugging, the daring Maas folded a pyramid in size from his original gift and completed a speech in defense of his project with the following words: “Dear citizens!”
Here it is, my sentence: "Book Mountain" in Spakenis, the so-called Bukenberg!
Nine years later, this 30 millionth mountain has grown.
It is part of the revitalization project, which also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent houses and townhouses for a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, the "Book Mountain" was awarded the second prize of the contest "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, the faceless suburb, which previously could not offer anything but the postmodern pedestrian zone and the surprisingly ugly town hall, the white facades of which suggest the idea of the dairy plant, became richer in one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly, in Spakenis appeared the first in the history of this town public building for cultural purpose.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the hood for cheese.
There is only one elevator that passes in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and readings will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glazed on all sides of the room - bright and easily foreseeable, the floors made of burnt brick and elegant street lights unmistakably create a sense of public urban area.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
The look is involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and football-playing boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
“Usually book shelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Viny Maas.
We put the classical configuration of the space on the head and pulled the area to read from the inside out.
The interior of the book mountain is used skillfully: the center houses offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical rooms.
Especially pleasing is the black bookshelves that serve as the decoration of the walls, then parapets, then stairwells.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are lost in guessing what kind of unknown material it is.
“We sought to work with secondary materials,” explains Jop Traubrest, project manager representing the Spikenisse community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at one agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and in the fields in the Netherlands as a lining for roots used artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness.
It is cheap and saves time.
Subtle textiles last one or two seasons, after that it can be discarded.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was compressed in a four-centered panel.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbachoplast (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material, smelling a little resembling a new car and a little sneakers.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Whoever overcomes the path of almost 500 meters long will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only a fantastic view of the city, but also Dutch croquet and tree ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
Costs of a New Soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Troubrest.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain stands under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a while.
Wide glued wood farms, located perpendicular to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above the skeptic from the IT sector, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was already here.
As well as the teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cinny Bogard, who called Buckenberg “the soul of Spakenis, which has long been lacking.”
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his own collection.
These books were to take empty places on the shelves of the not yet fully staffed library - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are forced to the top.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vinny Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident is now connected in some way with this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it serves only for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal problem, which in professional jargon is called the creation of identity.
Spakenis wrote his literary story.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is only the starting point for building an identity.
Stake: "The Germans have to play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and Europe, doing so, Berlin balances on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian bid to obtain observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained in the vote.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support the actions of the Israelis in Gaza.
Germany needs to be careful in connection with its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - without speaking too critically towards Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone for flights.
As a result, NATO made this proposal.
Is Germany difficult to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, it is moving from a policy that, so to speak, was governed by the United States, to German foreign policy itself.
In addition, the situation is complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans are again between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only groping their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy that France or the United Kingdom is pursuing.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from a German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position independent of the position of the United States or European partners in their national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policies, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany’s economic interests are largely different from the interests of other major states, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Did these economic interests affect the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has major markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in the Arab countries.
Either way, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t give it too much importance, it’s not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relationship with the United States by abstaining in making important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I am sure that in Europe and even the United States, the understanding of the German position prevails.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic as it was in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even acquire a certain respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be considered.
There are different views in Europe about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the contrary, was clearly in favor of the veto.
Is there a divergence of views between the United States and many European states?
Due to American domestic policy, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama government has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly occupy such a position.
I believe that significant differences of opinion are not at all as significant as it always seems.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all happy with Netanyahu’s policy.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that’s what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be somewhat easier for the Germans if there was a single, consistent European policy, but now it is not.
They are therefore unable to act as part of a broader approach and are forced instead to act on their own vision of the situation.
This is what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of ties with Israel.
This topic has always been sensitive.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it really take on?
Or is the leading role still difficult for Germany?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes an important role, a variety of anti-German feelings appear.
The Germans are not just about to cope with this.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult situation than the United States.
It should take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, U.S. influence in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will have to play a bigger role.
Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or strengthens dislike for you - this is life!

“Protection protection” in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani - world-renowned trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren - too.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms whose names it is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the original names are sued.
But it is also clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
“It is increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a Taylor Wessing lawyer specializing in trademark infringements in the Far East.
On my desk every week appears in a new case of this kind.
It is enough for imitators to add only a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So Gucci turns Lu-Gucci out of the Lu-Gucci, you can register Prada-Kny instead of Prada.
In the same way, German enterprises are legally copied, for example, the manufacturer of sports goods Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the trademark registration department in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark there, an artificial name, which also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is known.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
But Pattloh's case is not like that. On behalf of his clients, he opposes that Chinese enterprises have completely officially received trademark registration from the department the right to use the name, which is already being protected somewhere else.
The Chinese call it "ban mampai", a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ba dakan".
This is the name of women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not admit guilt
“It hurts the business, it needs to be fought,” Pattloch said.
"The trade mark is blurred, the unique position is lost, the image suffers very much."
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated at millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China with sales of 15 billion euros per year is the third largest and fastest growing luxury goods market.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of dubious entries in the register of trademarks, and it is expensive.
The process can last up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about the cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, since after a long time the appealed name became the “regime of the market”.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he caused damage to his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the jungle law rules here.
There are also famous cases of graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with the manufacturer of construction machines Sany, an enterprise that soon acquired the manufacturer of concrete pumps Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo-branded Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo that reminded BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashionable goods Lacoste lost in China to simulators from Hong Kong and Singapore, from which the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves guilty.
The CTMO trademark registration office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 due to the lack of personnel and equipment of the premises there were difficulties.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency in the working process to the norm.”
Thus, the number of unprocessed cases on objections decreased by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, 81.500 claims are still awaiting production in the department.
Dealing with this is expensive
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China for the tenth time in a row topped the list of new registrations around the world, the department reports.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees was paid.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It is worth protesting many times more, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarator.
The Germans managed to ensure that the illegal production of counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the simulator secured the Chinese rights to the trademark Freudenberg.
It was its own omission, as the names in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Wetzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark registration department rejected the claim of Munich.
True, in both subsequent instances, Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues to fight until now.
You need to be on the alert
The issue is currently under consideration in the Supreme Court.
Wenzler hopes to bring the matter to a good conclusion and praise the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes away a lot of time, money and nerves from us.”
Domestic costs are hardly amenable to accounting, the company’s archive had to look through even the acts of a century ago to bring evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing side a “big six-digit amount in euros” for the settlement.
“Overwhere it is clear how expensive it is for us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Namely, if the simulators register unprotected trademarks there.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this, it was able to prevent registration.
“You have to be on the lookout,” Wentzler says.
Both Pattloch’s lawyer and lawyer recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark protection regulations, rather, foreigners should be “anything worth protecting in any way, also registered in China,” says Wenzler.
Otherwise, it can cost much more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposite side license fees for their own name, explains Wentzler.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in the disputed segment.
World AIDS Day: trampling, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice in this.
The history of relations that covered the distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, the heating is heard: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, ladies' boats and men's slippers pick up the barbecue on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
Only after that, the voices of singers - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly increase - they come, fascinate and follow each other.
And Fita Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his cloth shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
Monday night, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir rehearses a new song.
Fifty participants of the choir from 23 to 69 years old came to rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
"Om"Bani is a difficult thing, every voice of the choir has its own text, moreover, in a completely foreign language: Zulu, spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Assistance for Self-Help
According to UNAIDS, United Nations AIDS programme, there are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245 000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 per cent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitzhani, the association Voices for Africa found chefs in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares for further training.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take over the patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniforms and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulus mean a narrator or a praiser.
In this hall do not speak a run-buta, but they know how to sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: to the south of Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Infected forty-five percent
About 2000 people live there, some are still in simple clay and straw huts, among residents there are many children.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the HIV virus.
In Esitzhani, miniature reflects the disease of the whole of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the foreskin in men, which has proven reduces the risk of infection by half, among the population is almost not accepted.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before the participants of Imbogni saw a lot of children on the streets, who lacked not only parental care, but also just everything: food, clothes, education.
Without schooling, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants - for a few euros a year to send a child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot meals once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voices for Africa association, which has since almost professionally cares for AIDS orphans in Esitzhani.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and trypper (gonorrhea).
Frequent viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes and hepatitis.
Pubic pediculosis and scabies belong to parasitic STIs.
What are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four of every five cases of syphilis registered in Germany, transmission occurs as a result of sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
The spread of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low - but about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections are significantly more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We also have a human papillomavirus among young people.
How does the number of cases of infection change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
Syphilis disease, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
There were about 2700 cases in 2011.
That’s about one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
In infectious diseases, ulcers in the genital area, complaints of urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, as well as bubbles or seals can occur.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can I protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not give one hundred percent protection.
After all, partially pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also spread through contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend a regular examination, especially with frequent change of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and avoid long-term consequences.
Chefdom, donations and not least fees for the performances of the choir throughout Germany allow you to collect something.
"In total, we have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitzhen," says Annete Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is managed by Tsodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also cares about the fact that the orphans were well suited, for example, one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as they call Zulusian old women, is the support of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and take care that children in uniform every day appear in the classroom in time.
Those who have no relatives do not go to a haven with a shelter for a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks, who prepare for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, the Voices for Africa association organized a clothing school, built two chicken coops and, together with the American health organization, PSI organized a curatory for HIV testing for many villagers.
It is difficult to imagine, but the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 Wifes
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because he’s associated with sexuality.”
Pretty unusual for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also blamed for the fact that the HI virus has spread so quickly in previous years.
But it also lies on the stray workers who spread the virus around the country.
There are free condoms literally on every corner, says Annete Lennartz, "but they are almost not used.
Another culture is flesh to the flesh.”
To maintain a little culture exchange, the Ibmogney choir every two to three years makes a trip to the south of Africa and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-consciousness, which many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites that sing songs in black - such a confession not only brings a good mood and joy, but even, it happened, caused tears in the eyes of the harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitzhani, where singers attend sponsored children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the Etsulveni River valley it is more than known.
“Go to Esitzhengi, there is a light,” say the people here.
And after the 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the stomping singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light burns also here.
NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover can have a thickness of up to 20 meters.
The US space agency has proved the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, as it can be seen from three studies published on Thursday in a special journal Science.
The Messenger probe found evidence that the region of the planet is constantly in the shadows covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the scientific director of the probe Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life have come to other places in the solar system.
Imperceptibly for the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as "Phoenix", explore the depths of the Universe.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small windows in endless distances.
The image comes from the camera, which was developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, who orbits the Sun after Neptune, Ceres, by the new definition of the international astronomical union of 2006, is not a “planet.”
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a “family portrait” of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue points, it is more difficult to identify pink “newborn” stars in the stellar circle.
This region of star formation - scientists unromantically call it W5 - discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6500 light-years.
This englared heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA's Spitzer telescope.
A ring similar to a doughnut consists of a material that the star threw away in the process of dying.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5400 light-years away from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer telescope took this photo of the galactic maternity ward.
The Staring Cluster of the Pleiada, also called "Seven Sisters", can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with the telescope, the colors are better.
As a red eye wins the observer the Snail Nebula on this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
Resemblance to the earth's continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive color reproduction.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they arose is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are the fragments of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the greatest and clearest images of the Hubble telescope: the whirlpool galaxy
Depending on the color reproduction, the images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the picture shows the Trifid Nebula removed several thousand light years in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-long, three-part), as dark stripes of dust are divided into three parts the hot heart of the cradle of stars.
In the constellation of the Ophiuchus, astronomers photographed the harbinger of the cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies rush towards each other and will inevitably collide.
This birth of a star, the Hubble telescope shot in the spiral galaxy M83.
One who does not like technical abbreviations can call it nicknamed "Southern Ginging Wheel".
A photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, which is 1400 light-years, consists of dust particles, the size of which is from ten to one hundred times less than that of ordinary house dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 30 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies called Arp 273 was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars of our Milky Way.
The starcrax is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosetka nebula, also constantly creates new stars - at a distance of 5000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly luminous galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views in the universe: the most important telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeem - even before Galileo Galileo went on to observe the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more and more and deeper than the spaces available to their gaze.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at the Palomar Observatory under San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, a "Big Binocular Telescope" has been installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
"Grane Telescopyo Canarias" has a giant internal structure - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Great South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of reducing the cost.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened to the vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-collective ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world's largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Extraterrestrial Intelligence Search Project (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing its computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands "A very large telescope" - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate the middle infrared in the visual tube.
The establishment of the European "Very Large Telescope" is also planned at the ESO Observatory.
Its main mirror should be set at 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected until 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
Telescopes "Kek" are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them looks into the sky also with the help of the Subau and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
You can see the illustrations here.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying pictures of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system - primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it should in the light of the first stars and galaxies look for the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest that at the south pole of Mercury there is ice.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the "Messenger" rotates closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the probe "Messenger" launched in 2004 - the first that rotates around Mercury - scientists are now sure of this.
Drink the oil every day and live up to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach the venerable age in biblically.
There is even a museum of longevity.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach the venerable age in biblically.
There is even a museum of longevity.
The search for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem relatively young.
The trip through the Talysh mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus with thundering rolls along the winding road past the thickened hills, turbulent rivers and ordinary peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you might think you were in Schwarzwald.
But this is the southernmost region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers from here.
Talyshas live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, which is known a little, except that they perfectly say in Farsi and Azerbaijan and are distinguished by longevity.
The end point is Lerik.
The small town boasts too heavy architecture of Soviet times, which does not harmonize at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe almost do not come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tedious.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes its oil to the Caspian Sea, here, to the province, has not yet reached.
However, Pilat Fatulyayeva (48) is convinced that Lerika has something to interest tourists.
"In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest festival - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulaeva said.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the biography of about eight dozen Talysh from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulyayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shed of Shirali Müslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
Birth certificates, however, are not.
And given the fact that the oldest person whose age is confirmed by the documents was 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
“He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,” explains Fatulya.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did Chaban Muslyumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of centenarians in Central Asia.
“Atcharom a lot of elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz says, “Agrief heavily live in Sardinia, a lot of very old people.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is impossible, since there were no registers of civil status.
Every day a glass of ghee
However, there is a fact that people in the Lerik area are strikingly often reaching the biblical age.
Now there are 20 people over 100 years old.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this by special genes of the Talysh.
The director of the museum, Fatulaeva, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of food.
Talysh like meat, bread and dairy products most often, many of them drink a glass of dung oil every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people youth? In Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzoev lives.
At the age of 97, it is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasian region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which is tirelessly rolling back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of his sons and daughter Mirzaeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
Two kids are also riding nearby.
In the kitchen, guests are prepared tea, which is served in typical bastards of Armuda.
Mirzaeva has perfectly flat and strong white teeth, under a head scarf she hides long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I'm always my hair with milk, so they never fell out and kept the color.
“And I never used a shampoo,” Mirzayeva said.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew up in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I've never bought food in my entire life.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest was after World War II.
But it became better when the “favorite father” Heydar Aliyev got at the helm.
Propaganda does not often sound in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan, knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham accepted the reins.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elders.
230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of the euro) Mirzayev receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this amount is an amount that can be well lived on.
And, perhaps, the long-grown son Mirzaeva is also right: "The elderly in our culture enjoy deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounded by care and happy.
What is not the reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word “human right” is not in the Constitution
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo indicate a deep split in the country.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, met with a fierce rebuff.
The Egyptian president did not stingy on pathos.
We must create a transition.
“And his success lies with my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly disunittivated in the confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of the religious state on the Nile at the grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said that he temporarily reduced the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence to “save the revolution.”
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of strength?
In fact, 234 articles were dragged in a 15-hour night race with obstacles at an Islamist constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the trial is based on “principles of Islamic law”.
But what do you mean, "principles"?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and we can fear that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal outlet arising from it for a more rigorous interpretation of the Shariah.
At least, one new article hints at this: in all matters relating to Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamist institution of the country, which enjoys great authority throughout Sunni Islam, should be involved in the council.
This should not, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, that the de facto would have a consequence of the restriction of the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is the subject of interpretation
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians must be maintained for the military court.
These courts during Mubarak’s power period served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect the “true essence of the Egyptian family” and “support its morality and values.”
Legally, this is so vague that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature.
In the open text, this means nothing more than censorship.
No article does not explicitly establish the equality of men and women.
But the other forbids insulting and denigrate the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished, remains unclear.
It is also a doubtful wording that “insulting people” is prohibited.
Will there be enough caricatures of the president or jokes about the jurist?
The question of interpretation, like much in this project, which Morsi offers for signature and which, according to him, “very soon” will be submitted to the Egyptians to a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For several weeks, the opposition has been formed against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in the unusual unanimity of Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document even before it could come into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the international atomic energy department, Mohammed ElBaradei, said that the draft constitution is a place “in the dusty haven”.
Through the short news service Twitter, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead a “putch against democracy.”
“If he declares a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw it away,” said opposition leader Yasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been taken away,” said the Egyptian media, opposition politician Khaled Ali.
Many judges also said they did not want to watch the referendum, which would make it invalid.
"The Quran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for an opposite demonstration, but, as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayers on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the covers and adherents of Salafists, who shouted: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded from Morsi: "Purity the country!" And they assured, "The Quran is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, on which it all began, provoked the state of almost civil war.
Morsi’s followers obviously didn’t want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke loudly and clearly.
Now it is time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
The majority is for the Islamist project, this is considered a settled matter.
“The concept of ‘human rights’ is never mentioned.”
Hafiz Abu Saeda is furiously from this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the Egyptian human rights organization (EOP) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison under Mubarak or brought to trial.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words “human rights” are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with “Welt am Sonntag”.
Expanding Morsi’s influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent a clear blow to the democratic rules of the game and lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto annulled it,” Saeda said.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
The Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even an international community that looks at the ideological struggle of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a reckoning for that.
The Tahrir Demonstrator warns: “You are creating a monster that you can’t control.”
Norwegian ractirisk: the worst-smelling fish in the world?
Norway’s five million population has one of the highest living standards, not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Perhaps the mystery of the success of this country is somehow connected with the local addiction to one extremely sensual fish dish?
Take some overripe pieces of cheese.
Pour them into a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a bunchy smell of racptics - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, a three-hour drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air is poured indestructible characteristic smell.
Rafficcus is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandering in water for up to a year, depending on which long-grown.
As the twilight and cold, the crowds of Norwegians gather at the festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this, let’s say, breathtaking dish.
“It is eaten raw and washed down with a glass of aquavit, local cumin vodka,” explains Harad Hardwarsen, a local firefighter by profession and part-time “Rakfician general” who leads the festival.
Everywhere around us, people eat fish cut into small cubes and wash it down with considerable portions of alcohol.
“Someone likes aquavit more than racketeering,” Haward said.
This drink can kill the smell.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under the nose, then everything is not so bad - little different from the portion of sushi, which you have been carrying with you on the bus for a long time.
Raffis is a Norwegian product from completely different times, of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish in the fall were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water.
Then in the deep winter, when the fish was already well and thoroughly harbored, it was extracted and, muffling the perception of alcohol, was eaten.
Even in the memory of the previous generation is the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants who are attracted to jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago and a much more prosperous neighbor) come to work here en masse.
Rafficus is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat fetid element of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or sandwich will cost you 9 pounds sterling ($ 14).
Norway rarely appears in the world’s news, and most of the country’s residents seem to be satisfied with it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and a right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called “July 22.”
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peace-loving country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
At the heart of today’s prosperity of Norway is the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“However, oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, carrying herds with a sustained racper, a woman with long blond hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are such a people, as you call it, judicious.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks English.
We don't like to show up, we're not boastful.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry are invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone lit up with money they didn’t have, Norway calculating all costs.
“While you can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, this is enough for happiness,” says Anna.
“And there is a rakfix,” she adds with a carefree laugh.
I'm standing in the snow in line for some food - I'm enough to reliance.
Here is a hamburger with alder meat - this is certainly an exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for an even more and more fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel has a special Christmas dinner dedicated to the rakpisque, during which visitors by voting determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There is a direct television broadcast in which the presenter is shown in a tie-butterfly surrounded by plates with ractias.
It's like a Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor-Jürgen, what rating did you rate for the best fish there in your mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair, maybe overdoing the aquatic.
Or maybe just inhaling the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto will have an unfairy start of his career.
While the newly elected President of Mexico Enrique Peña Nieto is preparing to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will have to face, and mixed expectations of the population of his country.
Road traffic in Mexico is now in a particularly deplorable state.
This city is overloaded with transport and at the best time, and from Monday, steel barriers were erected, cutting several key highways to the capital and causing chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not in order to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from reaching the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will put on a presidential bandage and take the reins of the country.
He faces a difficult task.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calderón, who is now shifting its powers, but the country is mired in the war on drugs, which in six years has already claimed about 60,000 lives.
“My government is telling the people of Mexico their willingness to fight violence,” Mr. Peña Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the White House oval office earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Before such statements, next to the President of the United States, the political career of Mr. Peña Nieto developed as governor of his native state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state, surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Recrepit man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bruce, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents make him credit the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are strikingly different from the roads with potholes and yamas that were previously on this site.
Tablets with his name hang on a modern building of the sports center and on an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We have hopes for real and serious changes to him,” says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvere Hernandez, a congressman of the state from the Peña Nieto-led institutional-revolutionary party (PRI).
We expect real and decisive changes that our country is so urgently needed, primarily in the field of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous stay in power, the PRI party was supplanted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvela admits that after his 12-year absence from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Henrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of meaninglessness, which the opposition put forward to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman, and above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nesawalkoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast with the cobbling streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the overpasses of highways, it in many senses is a suburb of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also the harsh nature of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops were involved in the direness of drug-selling gangs in these areas; and violence against women was particularly acute.
In a vacant lot near a vast landfill in the last two years, several dozen bodies of the murdered women were found.
More than a thousand women were killed in the state of Mexico City during the governorate of Mr. Peña Nieto - this is much higher than this in the unfortunate city of Ciudad Juárez, whose name became a household name when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Peña Nieto’s opponents, it is at best that during his tenure as governor, he failed to cope with the problem of killing women.
At worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring this problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated area, Irinaya Buendiya hardly holds back tears, showing me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of Mariana in 2010 committed suicide.
However, her family believes that her roommate killed her.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body washed before,” recalls Ms. Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already numb.
Mariana’s mother recounts this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, on which only one word is inscribed: justice.
This, according to them, was denied to this family.
“The state’s officials treated me like an old gossip, dissatisfied truancy violator.
They want people to just accept everything they say and keep quiet.
But this is wrong, so it is impossible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around,” she says.
Wearing the presidential bbw on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on with her without much responsibility.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have affected violent crimes, and the new president has promised to make this problem a priority during his reign.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president as the governor,” said Olvera, a congressman from the Valle de Bravo party.
However, this is what the families of the victims in Ciudad-Nesa fear most of all.
Bradley Manning did not complain about the ill-treatment, the prosecution said.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning’s statements about the bad conditions of detention.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning’s stay in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense demands to close the case on the grounds that the conditions of Manning’s imprisonment were brutal.
The U.S. Army is accused of kidnapping several thousand classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of the many opportunities to file a complaint about the ill-treatment he said he had to endure while in a military prison.
During a cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, military prosecutor Major Ashden Fein said that recordings of weekly visits by prison administration officials for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, do not contain complaints of mistreatment.
The cross-examination in the course of the defence’s motion to dismiss the Manning case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were severe and in themselves a sufficient punishment were carried out the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of information was Manning.
During a Friday hearing, Attorney Féin, along with Manning, reviewed the reports that were filled after Manning’s visits by the administration during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was on a strict regime of imprisonment from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Attorney Féin asked on Friday reports, Manning admitted that he assessed the appeal of the prison administration as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized”.
The reports considered do not contain complaints of mistreatment, despite the fact that Manning was directly asked about the conditions of his content, says Fein.
Manning replied that he had expressed oral concern about these problems and that the administration members visited had discussed these problems with him and stated that they would be taken, but had not been recorded in writing.
“They recorded ‘there weren’t any problems, but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise the issue in conversation,” Manning said.
The warmagapist, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain of misuse of him in January 2011 during a meeting of the commission that he had expressed in writing a few months before.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to get him to remove the “injury prevention” regime and softened the terms of imprisonment.
Representatives of the military leadership explained that the limited regime of detention - a level lower than the supervisory regime in order to prevent suicide - was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as for the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I was all right to cancel the trauma prevention regime. to improve my level of life, from my point of view,” explained Manning.
On Thursday, Manning testified to his arrest in Iraq and a transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that the thoughts of suicide appeared in him in Kuwait, and that he once lost consciousness due to the intense heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is decided, and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to the Camp-Arifjan base, to the size of my prison,” Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in a small cell – at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day – all alone.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, as they used to sleep or even just lie in the daytime forbid the rules.
According to Manning, during his sleep, he constantly beats him light penetrating outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned in the bed at night, then, according to him, he was awakened and forced to turn over on his back.
Manning’s lawyer formally objected to Manning’s ill-treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Lewinworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge asked Manning about the statement he made during his testimony on Thursday, that after one night he was forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at the morning check.
Manning said he was unable to cover up with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to the judge’s questions on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard’s order that he had to leave a blanket that he could hide behind, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to leave him.
On Thursday, Manning said the previous night he was forced to sleep naked because of his attempt to show the officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer he could use a elastic of a pantry or flip-flops to injure himself, but he didn’t.
That night, according to Manning's testimony, his underwear, the flip-flops and glasses were taken from the cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he had to endure during his detention and significantly reduces the sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court to begin consideration of his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty for less serious crimes, and others to challenge other charges as excessive.
The resumption of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held in Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of those arrested with the most stringent regime.
Among the charges brought by Manning are aiding and abetting to the enemy, illegal assistance in publicting the Internet, transferring information relating to national defense and theft of state property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he may face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is a Mexican-American story.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind residents of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navaretta believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the corridor for arrivals, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The signs were pointed to two queues: one for Mexicans (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California, and I've been called Mexican all my life.
It's just a conventional name, just like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends from New York consider themselves Italian.
Later, I settled on a complex design of “American of Mexican origin”.
But I was here in Mexico.
Here, in the homeland of my grandfather, there was no need for conditional names or complex designs.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than native speakers, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
So I got my American passport and stood in line for Extrajeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago, when the newly elected President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto was happy to speak of the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which the Mexicans are now, just as well as possible to stay in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and fulfilling old grievances.
Most Americans never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and at gunpoint forced its leaders to abandon half of its territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for any US statesman to say at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elite of Mexican society, there are immediately complaints that the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of its neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence.
At the same time, the most difficult is the relationship between Mexico and more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about offenses?
They're enough.
In Mexico, there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities for themselves in this country, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, there are so many people of Mexican origin for only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone - a father or grandfather - had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often, it was Mexicans of a certain type - swarthy, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, it is seen differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got a job for good work, but we will not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confusing and unclear, but we know which country to consider its own.
United States of America.
In addition, we know that most of the representatives of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We respond to them the same.
They see in us a reminder of humiliating lesions and treat us as second-class people as non-stupid Mexicans.
We don’t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
We would not be behind the Silk Curtain, finding a well-fed life in the United States, but having lost spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican descent - Mexicans are more clear about their national identity, and Americans of Mexican origin are offended.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of my familiar Americans of Mexican origin do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we love Bruce Springsteen.
Getting the best of two worlds, you inevitably lose roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relationship is not confusing enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as Mexican ambassadors and represent its interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
It's not gonna work.
Too many grievances in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rument of corruption and the drug trade, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can’t forgive the United States as it did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still offended by how most recently in Mexico treated their relatives.
Yeah, yeah.
Perhaps we have more in common than I thought.
Old Battles in the New Middle East
Israel-Cross ceasefire agreement and Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for further peace
Is it possible to have a lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes to the conclusion that such hopes are futility.
The seemingly lack of debate about who started first; many buildings have been turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians have been killed, most of whom were civilians, and six Israelis; for the first time in the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly bogged down in their perennial conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated differently, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have been entrenched in a rebellious storm, and the Palestinians and the Israelis failed to stay away from the vortex that shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give rise to optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes that took place this week only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, who came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will claim that they forced Israel to retreat, despite the losses suffered by them.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million residents are blocked in one of the most dense and problematic corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is building up its popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the More Moderate Fatah Movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
Turkey, which was once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, supported Hamas, followed by Qatar, one of the richest and dynamic Gulf States.
The celebrating Hamas supporters say that Israel has created an Islamist crescent over Israel, from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the Hozbollah paramilitary group, to Syria, in which more and more pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow the power of Bashar Assad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities are threatening the allies of Hamas.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where under President Mohamed Morsi strengthened the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who did not pay special attention to the support of Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization that is largely similar to Hamas, and their leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic spaces, Hamas can become a significant player whose voice will not be able to drown out even Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
In a military sense, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost of creating it and successfully destroyed many of Hamas’s missiles launched.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained faithful to its unaltered position; many European countries also blamed the beginning of the last round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, which largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004. Approximately 30 Israelis have died from rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has been able to minimize the problem of suicide bombers, in part by a wall that enters the territory of the West Bank, a significant part of the unrecognized Palestinian State, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party – in preparation for the January 22 elections – has united with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of indulging the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If you give up all the power in the West Bank, will they begin to launch rockets from there to Israel, as their fellow workers in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and strictly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps supporters of the “hard” line will win; however, their calculations can be refuted in the Arab spring.
Despite the fact that the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and other countries do not experience the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
The defense part of Israel’s budget is greater than that of all its Arab neighbors combined.
The outbreak of war with the regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economy.
The pagmatism of the President of Egypt, Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama on a ceasefire, is a good sign and can mark the beginning of change.
Israel must, to no lesser, take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes come in the Arab countries, depriving the Palestinians of the right to self-determination is a time bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like a bus blown up in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of a democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic dimension - the rise of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
For the bloody operations, which are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement, it is necessary to pay the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse
There remains the only solution that is relentlessly called upon by sensible representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper: the formation of two states and Israel’s concession of territories in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, the hope that a ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, which is long overdue to decide to block arms shipments to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, have a lucrative position more than ever to convince Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an upcoming vote at the UN, which could result in the recognition of the virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama has to play its part in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he had not submitted his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still demonstrates the reluctance to join the solution of this problem.
This is a disastrously short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the law on unified packaging for cigarettes came into force.
Warnings about the dangers of smoking and the image of the affected body parts are contrasted on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first Australian law in the world on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same dragon of dull-and-flower color with eerie pictures of body parts affected by the disease and images of children whose health is undermined by smoking by their parents.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions warning of the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced mandatory from this Saturday - the names of stamps that are printed in the same small print.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the registration of tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says the purpose of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving this bad habit of fashionable status.
This decision is based on the results of studies that showed that people who have not started smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
“Obviously, even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey with the help of packaging,” explains the Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek, referring to studies that showed that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess in the logo.
Australia is one of the world’s least share of smokers, so these changes will not particularly affect the profits of transnational corporations, but the possibility of taking such measures is already being considered by other countries.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will sell cheap and affordable cigarettes.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those that have been conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply much more such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of a small family-owned company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigarettes and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on packaging has grown rapidly (almost from scratch) since two months ago companies such as British American Tobacco, British Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the case in a high court of Australia, where they tried to appeal.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesale companies and expects a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After the adoption of a number of laws in Australia that made illegal television advertising of cigarettes and their support for sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers from exhibiting cigarettes in a prominent place, advertising of tobacco products moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing ads online, but it cannot limit foreign websites.
“If you’re selling tobacco products and you have only this small loophole, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting to you,” explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in the number of trademark reviews written on behalf of alleged organic users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared his strength and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind this?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco claims that the industry is now more engaged in adapting to the new rules than advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry even took measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states make claims under the World Trade Organization, stating that trade had been unfairly restricted, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Thani Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packing laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory posting photos warning of the dangers of smoking.
Now this rule is adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively disposing of innovations.
These pictures don't hurt me.
I just don't pay attention.
“Just grab a cigarette and hide a pack in your pocket,” explains Victor El Hig, who buys cigarettes with a photo of a tumor of the oral cavity on the pack.
Honestly, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the tobacco store King of the Pack in the center of Sydney, claims that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on the shelves
“I used to have an hour to unload the new batch, and now it’s been four hours,” he complains.
“The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it’s over, close the store,” he says, throwing up his hands.
Bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane found mechanical problems and replaced with another plane, which we waited for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of boredom.
I won't lie to you.
Half a day at the airport in anticipation of the flight is really boring, and here neither books, nor magazines, nor iPhone, nor even duty-free shops will help.
However, recently, more and more scientists and specialists in children's development are in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, for us and for our children, not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we should strive for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time not.
We'll get back to that.
I used to, like many, I believed that boredom is an invention of recent times, when people have more free time.
This is not the case, says Peter Tui, a professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, author of the book “Brigged History of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls in Pompeii found Latin inscriptions of boredom, dating from the first century.
At the same time, the question remains that we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an adjunct professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
Having studied the research on this topic and asking a question to the target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want, but can’t do what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person does not do something that he would like to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main point in the experience, he says, is “violation of attention and the associated deterioration of the mood and the feeling that time is stretching slowly.”
According to the description of boredom, it may seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we feel like we’re bored when it’s really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study, “Unoccupied Mind: Definition of Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment, the participants of which listened to a voice recording that read the journal.
Some participants also heard loud sounds of a non-customer TV program included in the next room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so that they could barely be disassembled, and the third group only listened to recording the voice without an extraneous soundtrack.
Those participants who heard a low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or fascinating task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fensk, an adjunct professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, “for example, peering into the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.”
It is believed that when people start swaying on a chair or drawing scribbles on a piece of paper, they do it from boredom, but now we know that in fact such actions simply help not relax physically.
“The study has shown that children who are not forbidden to be fired and spinning learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly,” says Professor Fensk.
At some point, we all feel bored: with a flight delay (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting film.
However, different people demonstrate a different degree of inclination to boredom.
In the 1980’s, researchers developed a “scary of a cupclotheign scale” to measure such individual features.
To determine the assessment on such a scale, questions and statements are used, for example, “A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous” or “I’m too much interested, so there is not enough time for anything.”
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys are often bored with girls, - says Stephen Vodanovic, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially with a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers often miss.
In 1991. Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was associated with the help of a pager with almost 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He obtained the following results: 32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such boredom would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adoster has a peak inclination to be bored,” mainly because children and teenagers are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s go back to my original question: is it good?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, it shows, it can push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling or abuse certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who devoted more than two decades to study this problem.
“So our brain tells us to do something else; it’s boredom,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what to do.
If you get bored and direct this energy to the guitar or culinary experiences, you will make yourself better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will get better only for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop bored, but he will not learn to fight boredom on their own or in any other way to manage your time and employment, says Professor Fensk.
“And such self-regulatory skills are used in a variety of situations,” he says.
Your child learns not only to self-employment, he also learns self-control at all.
I don't think it's a big deal to be praised.
However, it is not worth considering it a bad either.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of actions and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“We see it in such a way that we need to experience more often, despite the fact that boredom is an extremely unpleasant, insatiable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In the modern world, we are accustomed to constant excessive stimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when there is silence, we are lost and do not know what to do.”
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana in Colorado will be applied
Anthony Orosco, a nineteen-year-old football team player and a student at a community college in the southeast of Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offence that it will soon be completely legal throughout the state: possession of a small portion of marijuana and a pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosko says that one day in September, he and his friends were in Lamar and was driving a prairies near the Kansas border while police stopped.
After the policeman found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orosco was sued for possession of drug possession and the possession of a drug use device - minor offenses, for each of which a fine of $ 100 - and the date of the court session is assigned.
“We are treated like criminals,” Mr. Orosko said.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that continues for several weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small quantities for entertainment, the decision of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as on the place of consideration.
Charges of minor offenses related to marijuana are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington state, which took a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped pressing charges against people aged 21 and older for possession of small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as a couple of weeks the law comes into force.
However, in the more conservative counties of Colorado, prosecutors have decided to consider existing cases related to marijuana and are still prosecuted for possession of this drug.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, they are voting to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
“It’s all evolving so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” says Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in the town of Aurora in the east of Denver.
Representatives of the regulatory authorities in Washington state are also puzzled by scratching their heads.
They will have to formulate rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this needs to be done before December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or badly, is ahead of most other states in resolving marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes and now for entertainment.
“In Colorado, a more orderly market, so they will serve as a good example,” explains Brian Yi. Smith, representative of the Alcoholic Manufacturing and Marketing Board in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits than put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
“We have no real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The Washington state bill, named I-502, will enter into force on December 6 and plunge the state into a state of uncertainty for a whole year, when state licensing systems are not yet there, and the right to own marijuana has already been legalized.
And there are still difficult technical aspects that need to be solved during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state’s order on “adequate access” to licensed marijuana, banning its trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be especially difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses in cities, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” explains Ben Livingston, a spokesperson for the newly established Marijuana Legalization Research Group.
On 21 November, the Oates Police Chief from Aurora sent a message to his subordinates by e-mail that the city prosecutor’s office would no longer hold the age of 21 to be held accountable for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police stopped cuddling people in these irregularities “from now on.”
Police chief Oates said police would monitor compliance with the city ' s rules governing the activities of marijuana-growing medically and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and distributors.
Weld County Attorney in the north of Colorado, Ken Buck, is a stricter approach to the issue.
After the vote on the bill, he stated that the prosecutor’s office would continue to hold marijuana possession, mainly in order to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
At the moment, 119 persons are charged with possession of two or fewer ounces of marijuana, although many of them are accused of other violations.
“The duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places like the villagers of Mesa, where the voting participants rejected the proposal to legalize marijuana.
The police of the Grand Janksh, the largest city in the district, no longer prosecuted adults for owning a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger upheld this decision, but also decided not to withdraw charges on already open cases related to the possession of marijuana.
“I believe that ensuring compliance with the law until it changes is our direct responsibility,” he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported this decision, the inclusion of marijuana use for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different places of the state revealed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state experiment with marijuana.
“The district attorneys have a cultural barrier in this matter,” explains Sean McAlister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of marijuana possessions, and a local representative of the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
“They have been persecuting people for so long for this that they can’t really accept the fact that it’s no longer a crime,” he said.
Colorado and Washington – the first states to have a small amount of marijuana in the same way as alcohol – are destined to become an experimental field on a national scale to test the very idea of drug legalization.
Proponents of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time they are wary of instructions from federal authorities, who still plan to consider selling and growing marijuana as federal crimes.
Proponents of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Justice Department will cede to this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of traffickers and patients who had been used for medical marijuana, the federal government in most cases has given the go-ahead for the medical purpose trade in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Agents of the Drug Enforcement Bureau are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to the recreation marijuana stores regulated by the state authorities, which are allowed under the new law, says Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug adviser in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores, which would not have been able to open earlier than a year later.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western state, put forward a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in this position that we’re giving someone a license, and then it will cause serious problems at the federal level,” says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronela Wyatt: I survived from Oxford for being a conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
As long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium, laying two foundations of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the Faculty of History of Worcester College Oxford University in the late eighties, I collected my bags and left that resulted in the first real scandal in my life.
My father could not stand it and cried.
Friends were confused.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates had sex in the next room.
Writer Norman Wilson joked that I was leaving because I had to drink from the screeched cups.
It wasn't really that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, she ran away because I was systematically poisoned and intimidated.
Not because of my rather unusual name or that I was in a private school.
I was poisoned for only one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You may ask, why remember this now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students, holding center-right views, is subjected to the same persecution.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred of Oxford-conservative students is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as the one provided to persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from the college Buildus Christie College in Cambridge say that they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and make themselves feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the College’s Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recently released BBC 2 documentary about the student policy “Land of miracles: young, smart and right”, in which the conservatives were presented with eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, who travels into a rolls-roy, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver brothel.
In other universities, conservative students complain that they make “scapegoats because of the increase in tuition fees.”
Luke Black, 20, vice president of the Conservative Association at the University of Nottingham, said in an interview with one of Sunday’s newspapers that “in the university environment, the skew towards leftist views is increasing.
People who don’t even know us in advance consider us arrogable and unpunished by the rich children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student of the School of History of Corpus Christie College, which was asked to strengthen protection, calls this atmosphere “uncomfortable”, and Stephanie Ceyll, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says that the attitude of members of the student club to the carriers of center-right views has deteriorated significantly.
“This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply for the normal life of club members,” she says.
For the first few weeks in Oxford, I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, a timid and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish against hatred of the conservative party.
A year earlier, the university was voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
In the first days of the week, when students get to know each other and with teachers, I first felt what was waiting for me ahead.
I did not know that teachers not only looked through their fingers at the persecution of conservative students, but also enjoyed participating in it.
Political issues - the strike of miners, the privatization and disagreement of the government to apply sanctions against the government of apartheid in South Africa - penetrated through the walls of the classrooms sheathed with wooden panels.
At my first seminar, I needed to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
“Miss Wyatt,” said the teacher, now the late Harry Pitt, “please translate the first paragraph.”
The text was hard for me, I stucco.
Harry Pitt was a very bile man with a face-like face.
"Thetcherists basically don't teach French or do they just lack brains?" - he asked.
Other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few initial lessons of French in your free time, unless you are, of course, very busy in society,” Pitt said.
I went back to my room completely miserable.
That night, I was in college alone at lunch; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the English Language Faculty, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservative Association.
“I know who you are,” he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Anyone who is suspected of sympathy for the conservatives will be bullyed.
It's not easy for me to myself, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be harder for you.
Most conservative freshmen pretend to be Labour.”
Later, in the local pub, I was cowardly trying to hypocritically.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick failed.
The first-year-old of the faculty of philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied in Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious.”
Other students picked up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
How do conservatives have sex? - I asked one of them.
- They're pounding each other, aren't they?"
I felt as homosexuals must have felt before the criminal prosecution was abolished in the sixties.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour Party and hide my real beliefs?
The three years I have come to be a hell of complete persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher at my college, who did not hide his conservative views, was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He hardly appeared in college.
He depied him for provinciality, petty and adherence to the Marxist-deterministic view of history.
In 1997, he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he told me.
I started going to Oxford from a parental home in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased capital friends.
I told my father I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were accepted there.
“But it’s the best university in the world,” he said in a complaint.
- There's not capable of this, but not in the city of sleeving spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably.”
His moist eyes were clouded.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you leave the university."
I was exhausted by regular trips to London and my emotional protection was weakened.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and abandoned his convictions.
Next week, during the seminar, when the next history teacher seriously called me “the enemy of the people”, I decided to do the same.
In my soul, I was burning with shame, I admitted that “military brains were washed by my parents,” and called them “old fools.”
The respite was short-lived.
The last nail in the cover of my career in Oxford was destined to score my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for publications belonging to Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't leave, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed up a suitcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a cliff and a rag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation in the educational institution.
The sadder is that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Toy prime ministers, but to this day is hiding behind an undeserved reputation of the university, in which equality and freethink are valued.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the exhibition "Valentino: sewing master", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bouremica and other well-known clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, the only place in the British capital worthy of accepting the Valentino Garavani exhibition.
The designer admitted this during the opening of Valentino: a sewing master, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is “il Silor” by Garavani, but it could not be written without his eminent clients.
Valentino always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first hall of this exhibition, opened until March 3, abound in personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga-Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Shantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social upsurge: from a modest tailor from the city of Voger in northern Italy to the idol of the international “elita”.
Being in love with the royal court is nothing wrong with that.
“They at least do not extinguish the cigarette butts of your gorgeous carpet, as do some beautiful pop stars,” says Baroness Fiona Tixen-Borneitsa.
In the 60's and 70's we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an unparalleled host and receives guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all really liked to come in his chalet in Gstaad,” explains Haini’s ex-wife Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugene Niarchos.
Valentino always preferred elegance to fame.
And despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Matzza, representing Valentino
Argentine model Valery Mazza remembers the charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner with his home, it was after the fashion show on the square of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
The style of Valentino was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her decoration, in food, in music.
“Each of the guests Valentino made you feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during the Fashion Week in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
Parade of ancestral
The life of Garavani is a story not of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Somerset House galleries was turned into a glamorous subium of sixty meters in length, which offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of models and must defile the subtitle, making the "snakes" of dreams that sparkle with masterpieces from Valentino, such as the dress that Jacqueline Kennedy chose for her wedding with Aristotle Onassis, a suit that the costume that the costume that the costume that theEmpress Fara Diba.
In this public, names such as Sybilla Luxembourg, Gloria von Bund DTaxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg are brilliant.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember him beautifully.
These were pants, a shirt, "vill" and a jacket from the collection of autumn-winter 1971-1972.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the designers’ muse.
“I prefer him to others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,” adds the former duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they “fit” to his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and modinal lawmaker Patricia dévala Giovampala d'Arenberg also can not forget the first time she was dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have age and a reason to wear one of his evening toilets.
The hour came at the end of the 90's.
I bought my first vested Valentino dress to wear it for a holiday at my cousin's castle, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with a frills, a "corsage" in the fold and a cutout without straps.
“It was a dream that came true,” says Rodrigo d’Arenberg’s widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps his festive dresses from a fashion designer with "maximum caution... because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories accompanying him.
"King" of fashion
The great finale of the exhibition in Somerset House - Marie-Shantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding with Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "girls" (as the fashion designer calls his seamstress) to make this ivory silk outfit with inlaying pearls, twelve species of various lace and a plume of four and a half meters.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress is a milestone of high fashion at the end of the 20th century, “the return of clients from the upper world.”
Intoxicated for many years, the “style of life” of the elite, now Valentino himself is her best representative.
The Grand Cross Chevalier (the difference of the highest rank in Italy), the Chevalier of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literature, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“Always my attention was attracted by his sophistication, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance,” recalls d’Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée of Orsay.
He was sitting at a table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my big friend.
"He was impeccable, time does not exist for him."
If the princess says that...
The most difficult profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health, dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep stony trails
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them are Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn a living by sulfur mining in the Kawah-Ijang volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day Anto descends to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfur gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when in contact with the air.
Coupling huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, it puts them in two bamboo baskets, puts baskets on the shoulders and carries them up on a steep stony road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2.386 meters, is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for the emaciated loaders to rise in a turtle step, with difficulty keeping the balance and gently vigilantly groping the road so as not to stumble and not fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step could cost them a life, as happened to a tourist from France, who fell off the cliffs of Cavach-Ijen a few years ago.
Chemists from Kavakh-Ijen earn 5 cents for every kilogram of sulfur that is mined
Once upstairs, they pave their way between tourists who photograph them as if they were monkeys from a circus and, it is tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1.850 meters.
We are talking about the RT Kandy Ngrimbi, a plant that has been operating since 1960 this volcano and, it is better and not to say, its employees, with which it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical production, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for sugar whitening.
“Since the norm is the carrier of 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems like a miser for such an inhuman effort, it is three times more than what he would earn in the field.
“The fee for miners is very high by local standards, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid for coffee collection (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly earnings are equal to two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the loader who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not as heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuvangi, a town near a volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl with Bali, where some Hindus, and brought her to Java so that she would accept Islam."
In Anto asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes get watered because of toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years, risking himself in Kawah-Ijen, whose sero has already begun to affect him despite the presence of a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and his eyes get watered because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I will work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or a porter at the hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
Divide a dirty wooden hut with other porters, it rises every day at two o'clock in the morning, because sulfur does not cease to leak out at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and shines among the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating his way with a small flashlight connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters drag baskets with sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur mining to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work in their account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even get parts of 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) collection for photography, which, along with an entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), the guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to take a picture of the volcano and its mules.
“This work is for livestock, not for people,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old stocked porter who spent three decades in Kawah-Jeden since he left college.
Able to raise up to 110 kilograms, he assures that he will tolerate the work “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to retire, I'll die here because the volcano is my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches miners in the tight pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that none complains about their serious diseases. more serious, obviously, than their usual breathing problems, arthrosis, knee pain and ulcers on the shoulders, which were deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on the back, Unaynik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day, he and his comrades take out 15 tons of sulfur from a volcano that three trucks transport to a warehouse in Tamansari, covering a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among thickets.
“I’m not going to retire, I’ll die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unaynik said, opening a mouth wide that lacks a few teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, 30 years old, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult activities in the world: what human mules from Kawah-Ijen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame careers, stress and housing prices and education for the absence of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a husband a patriot, you are my wife a patriot, fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of the advertising of mint cakes, but despite this – or perhaps this – this video has become a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of rap that uses local sayings like “let’s put a bao (bun) in the stove” to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining form.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do their “national debt.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in the reproduction of our own kind, so we felt that this is the topic that we should touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, such as launching perfumes with pheromones or organizing fast dating parties (blitz dates).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but not necessarily worked.
So we thought, why don’t we do the most creative thing possible to solve this problem, namely to compose rap?
1.2 children
Whoever doesn’t take this so lightly is the Singapore government.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to give birth to more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to 15,000 dollars per child, extends maternity leave and provides tax benefits.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-city in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservatism and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population administration, is currently at the level of 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - which is known as the percentage of substitution - in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tanwei Ming, director of the Policies Division for Married Pairs and Families of the National Population Administration, says that the reason for this is “an improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond marriage and family creation,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and the birth of children, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to sharply increase immigration to counterset population reductions, is indignation among the local population.
Singapore has websites that thrive barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping salaries low and unwilling to integrate.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that Singapore’s ruling party received the worst result in elections since independence last year.
After the elections, there was an attempt to solve the problem, with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has a known impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, spending on medicine and immigration policies, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts to ensure that so many small housing is not built.
For example, this began to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development guide has moved to the control of the number of small apartments known as the “shoe box” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are sold very well.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a idling lifestyle and deprive developers who want to build large family housing.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of the EL Developers dormant, says their “shoes” are sold much faster than more spacious specimens.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are sold out for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash receipts are increasing.
However, he recognizes that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers who were previously harbingered if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too overt voltage
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules could be a step toward increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the central’s financial quarter, it seems that they won’t have much effect.
“People are very overstrained, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people are putting it off,” says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another young man for 20 years.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and housing prices and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, the last word rests with Singapore.
Personal in offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of Spanish, we are talking about the property of a private or “sphere of privacy that have the right to protect against any interference.”
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when discussing on the Internet situations that he probably wouldn’t share outside the Internet?
elPeriódio interviewed five children from ten to 15 years old, frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very mine”, in the personal plane, and “password and username” when applied to social networks.
“I wouldn’t upload my biggest secrets,” says ten-year-old Jorge when trying to explain the meaning of personal sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail, and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,” he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine or someone who behaves stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or to write offensive or furious comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 friends at his FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother knows, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re answering me, I’m just loading them,” he adds.
“Social networks are entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or with my friends in a quick way,” he points out.
Without hesitation, he answers that he would never have accepted a request from an unfamiliar person.
I wouldn’t reckon with someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his friend list.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If they put pressure or demand on me, I’ll just remove them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experience of what is known today as a cyber-mobbing.
A friend of my friend was blackmailed on the social network.
He was threatened and excavated with money.
“He never found out who it was,” he assures.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the account.
“Only included confidentiality.”
Then he explains the sequence of steps to configure the account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I don't like a person or if I want it.
“Although I know it’s cybermobbing,” he said.
Key issues
Marieros Porras, an English teacher and a specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, you need to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet appeared as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she notes.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy from Yale University and author of Labor Digital Aborigines and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain this phenomenon.
Digital aborigines are they, children and young people who were born in the era of technology.
“We are digital immigrants who have to teach them, while we are still learning,” she says.
Explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is not enough for it.”
“Also that they are selective, while the most important thing for them to be popular is to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them reflect.
“To tell them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: There are things that you would not tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like it if you posted a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign pictures from parties, do you ask for permission from other people to celebrate them?
And one more thing, do everyone need to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they have to behave online as they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, so should be on social networks,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, professor of primary education and a counsellor on education, explains the need for heads of families to read social media policies in good faith.
By understanding each of the items, they have good reasons for talking with children about the prerequisites for opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,” he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson “do not talk to strangers.”
UNASUR summit ends without promulgation of the Lima Declaration
The 5th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the promulgation of the Lima Declaration, previously and theoretically signed by seven mandatory participants.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VI next meeting of Heads of State and Government of National University, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the homepage that it would be transmitted after closure, but then confirmed that it would be published on the Peruvian Government website at some point.
To questions about the text, they pointed out that the content was stated by the President of Peru, Olalt Umala, during brief statements for the press.
Journalists’ access to information about the Summit was always limited.
During the day, only was broadcast, in the press hall, video of the presidential assembly without the sound with the message "closed meeting, sound is prohibited."
The little information circulated among reporters was provided by the press secretary of some UNASUR governments attending the meeting, but not Peruvian.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused discontent among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an electronic media message with the “final declaration” of the summit, but we are talking about the statement of Umala, and not about the official document, which ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the 3rd South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and at that time, despite the fact that the press insistently required, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not distributed.
On the official website of ASPA, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but would limit the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague Court, which will resolve the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Oliantha Umala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the International Court of Justice, which begins hearing statements by both sides in Auge Monday, as part of the charges that Lima had put forward against Santiago.
“We will abide by and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently presenting to this international court,” Umala said.
“Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful resolution of differences, pacts and international tribunals,” Pinier added, and greeted Umalu’s hands against the backdrop of the flags of these two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents of the fact that they would obey the International Court of Justice came as soon as Colombia appealed this week to the Bogotá Pact, according to which it recognized the subordination of the verdicts of this international court after the decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in NATOSUR has been suspended since 2011 after the impeachment of its former president, Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollianta Umalala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and for closing the summit, a little later than noon Limsky time.
The head of state read the final document, which reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the directions of action on 31 projects among South American countries were approved, the amount of the expected investment amounted to $ 17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the residency agreements.”
He said that action was being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens’ insecurity and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America and to take into account the cumulative and effective risks of natural disasters.”
Since Europe is in crisis, “the economic union (Latin America) should not have a triumphant foundation, but should serve to expand our production foundation and anticipate a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give privileges to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connection of the spaces of South America, especially in the rustic and border zones. uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five belonged to Peru, and were limited to cross-axles on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and the two were aiming for a large link with Ecuador, but it did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations”, from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace would be united, and have good relations between neighbours, was another topic emphasized at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said before proceeding to participate in a regional meeting that he hopes to meet with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City for negotiations in a respectful form of maritime dispute as a result of the verdict of an international court dispute contested by Bogota.
“The day after tomorrow, maybe I’ll meet with President Daniel Ortega,” Santos said.
“We will revise all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua,” he said.
“I hope I can tell him President President that we will be able to cope with this as possible civilized and respectfully as possible,” Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they have the presence of a new president of that country, Enrique Peña Nieto, in office.
Also within the framework of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc tentatively met for approval of the Action Plan for 2013, which is aimed at strengthening dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Chile, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the latter's participation has been suspended.
Peru has a provisional presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe in the issue of the integration of citizenship”: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which “South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.”
Correa, who participated in the 6th presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans “threatened each other during the Second World War” and in other clashes, “but now they are almost one fatherland.”
He defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which is approved by the countries participating in NATOS.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian President has also shown himself to be a supporter of the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premine of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those who signed the San Jose Human Rights Pact.
Those who lecture never make any commitments, and we, South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and is funded by the United States,” he said, hinting at political asylum, Ecuador-based Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because he did not betray his principles with him, but respected his “deep values of democracy and human rights.”
He added that at one time “there were some suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and the process would not be respected.
He criticized, in addition, Swedish justice for demanding to arrive on its territory for questioning about the alleged sexual offence, while “the Swedish legislation itself considers it possible to implement it through a video conference that could be made from the Ecuadorian Embassy in London.”
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of a deterioration in Assange’s physical and mental health.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a small pulmonary problem, nothing serious,” the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What really is is the danger of deterioration of his physical and mental health due to imprisonment in small space without the possibility of doing exercises in the air.
“It affects the health of any person,” he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum issue granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of immunity that will allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary and stressed that there were negotiations in London to find a solution to the problem of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not negotiating human rights, we do not use the word in this case, but there were constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, is conducting a number of trials in various European instances,” he said.
“If the UK provides a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden, as her legislation perfectly allows her and, as she has done in other cases, interrogates Seignor Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or question him on Skype, tomorrow this problem will be exhausted.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate “mediocrity, unscrupulousness and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not spoiled politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this aspect, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, “neither bankers nor the bourgeois hegemon dominate Ecuador,” and added that, being re-elected, “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay’s veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization “must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the mask of legality,” because in reality “it destroyed the legality of Paraguayan democracy.”
The Ecuadorian President also considered, in addition, the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which was in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not respected.
This is a problem between the South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
You need to process them together in order to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good end to the dispute over the maritime borders, which is conducted in the same court of Peru and Chile, and expressed that “it is correct for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be.”
As for the opportunity to act as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for a third consecutive term, he said that he considers this possibility “with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult.”
Correa assured that if he loses in the elections in February 2013, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement considered that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so we have to recognize this responsibility,” he said.
If it would be my last term as president, and then we leave public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me he went for a treatment that had already been scheduled, routine, and it is expected that he will miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean exacerbation of the state of health of President Chávez,” he explained.
The head of the Equator State took part today in Lima in the VI Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
Deaths from AIDS today - the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was told that his AIDS test had yielded positive results.
“It’s like I’ve been drowned out,” he recalls that difficult, despite the whole doctor’s beat, the moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were fulfilled - he has already celebrated his 43 th birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the “oldest” patients of the hospital Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got in 1994, overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90-ies it would be difficult to believe - too few treatment options existed at that time, too little knew about the disease, too biased against patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a cut."
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it without worsening the quality of life.
However, not knowing about their illness, so far many people come when the virus has already caused damage, “depleted” their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the introduction of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, “a great achievement at the moment is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same,” said the head of the HIV department of HCG, Jaime Andre Viljanueva, citing the fact that this information was confirmed in April this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectious and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Viljanueva, explained that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system available in patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with the best life expectancy of those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with CD4, and up to 50 years, when reported 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that someone who receives a diagnosis of HIV-positive at the age of 25, according to these terms, “supporting control, will be able to live without problems up to 75 years,” he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is an average of 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS’ annual report), it is also true that 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died since AIDS in the advent.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths by May of this year have already been reported; however, it is claimed that there is widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatalities?
- Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
So I imagine it, this is how things are in our hospital.
At least the last 12 years we have not had a lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected state, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: “nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to conduct a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a massive scale, for all people who will ask for it.”
In their proposal, experts and officials of the State AIDS Prevention Council in Jalisco (COESA) agree on their proposal, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory, motivated only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancerous tumor.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they'll die, and they don't want to know anything.
“If I’m going to die anyway, I’d rather be able to fight three times a week,” they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, I take medications.
To date, his parents only know that he has had cancer.
I live a normal life like any other.
“I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to encourage their statement to those who are now, in the context of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person being responsible.
This message summarizes the AIDS response this year.
Condoms behind the shelf
The gulf between health programs and a simple citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who has been dealing with HIV-related issues.
And the biggest prevention is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, “in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages a hundred percent, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to the condom,” he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are teenagers.
"Why do you need them?" This is a popular issue, with echoing and condemning, from social workers, school consultants, pharmacy employees and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; so that condoms are not just behind the shelves and that a hundred of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
This is not an encouragement of promiscuity.
It’s not about paying for beer and motel, Governor Emilio Gonzalez replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity,” he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state ranks 4 in the national ranking for new and cumulative cases of AIDS and 13-th for HIV.
92% of infections are the genital tract, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal pathway.
It is estimated that 50 thousand people can live with HIV, since there are from 4 to 5 people who do not know about it for one registered case.
Given the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals, a decision that annulls the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through a competitive proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that procedures in support of the survival of firms that are permitted by Mexican laws are not valid in the country of bands and stars, in contradiction with international agreements.
In the practical sphere, the approval of the decision made on June 15 by Judge Harlein Hale in the bankruptcy court of the northern district of Texas leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of seizing their property on the other side of Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to the lead velofactor of glass in Mexico to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, citing three inconsistencies.
As an incursion, while the case judge notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says the main proceedings relate to the bankruptcy proceedings considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the verdict establishes that without inter-firm voting, recognized in the critical mass of the bankruptcy proceedings of the debts that Vitro branches had before the parent company, would not have been achieved the majority necessary for approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme is accepted.
There are half-dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Industries.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of the branches, Vitro creditors, who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely the vultures funds like Aurelios Capital, Alioness Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have reached a majority.
Voting would be 45 per cent vs. 37.
The Court of Appeal omits this data.
On the other hand, he accuses Vitro of the difficult situation that it has faced since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that the United States has overtaken by punching the country.
So far, the Gonzáles Sada family firm will appeal the decision to the court of appeal itself, so that the vote will reach its plenum, that is, five judges, due to the fact that only three voted.
In the event of failure, an application for a certificate will be made, which will require a review of the trial by the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government to the role of amicus curiae (“friend of the court”), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competitive Proceedings Act, signaling that it absolve itself of compliance with agreements signed by both countries to associate it with Article 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has been subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambole from two sides: they hit Vitro and beat the country.
The overall balance
Taking into account the several months of complaint posted on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Askarrag Andrad, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union Association of Aviators pilots has already discovered a bottleneck.
The court, headed by Carlos Días Cávez Morino, has just filed a criminal order against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to submit reports to the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Republic regarding the operation performed by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust fund of the IXE 198 million pesos, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be used to buy shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Askarragah Andrade is the main shareholder of Posadas hotels.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
After meeting at the weekend at a forum at the Caribbean University, a group of local and foreign environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of a common civil society approved the creation of a wide front to confront the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant center for sale and distribution in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean products of an isolated country, with a residential area near the employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, the Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that leveled part of the protected areas with the ground and put forward serious threats against the industry.
Death of ACTA
Regarding the government’s rejected Senate’s claim to explain under what circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Trade Agreement to Combat Counterfeit, known as the abbreviation in the ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, has already gone to the archives of the Mexican Institute.
As you know, the action was accomplished, despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as violating freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to repay long-term debts, without affecting short-term, the Home House housing developer places exchange certificates on the market for 500 million pesos.
The output is the first of four identical, with a payment offer of interest every 28 days.
Competival is born
Formed by NYCE, e-Quálith and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just been born, its goal will be the market for software cluster services in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Avid basketball traveler Hector Hetin Reyes was more than 60 years connected with this sport and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico keep in mind so many basketball stories as Hector Hetin Reyes.
And after all, before the brain hemorrhage caught him in a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the Higher Basketball League, an authorized and head of BSN with the Bajalon Covboys and the president of the Basketball Federation.
“I have performed a lot of roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time as when I was president of BSN, CEO of the National Team and president of the federation in the 1990s,” Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamon, where he lives with Isabel, his loyal wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball was my life.”
Reyes is not exaggerating, making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all the adorned with photographs and memorable things collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, starting from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old in a co-agent or contract agent.
“It was my best years I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cowboy championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent, or leader.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Minsie's debut at BSN.
Since then, Kuko Ortiz has been led by Kuko, who was a great administrator," Reyes said.
I remember Jean Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, “I have a very strong player for you, a height of 6’7.”
"You Want To?"
And that was the beginning of Minsci, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if Minsi brought Bayamon's championship, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and achievements of Minsi in the national team.
I remember how we won for the first time from the United States during the Olympic qualifying tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not for the Canadian referee who forced us to beat the final game, Reyes said.
That team since the 1990 World Cup is the best team you have ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one that she won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and defeated the U.S. national team, which was quite similar to the one that won our bronze at the World Cup.
In that team, not only again played Minsey, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico Lopez and Piculina (Aurina), but also young (Javier) Tonyito Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario Quichote Morales, who could not participate in 90 due to a knee injury.
The team, which may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic qualifying tournament in Neuken, Argentina.
With role-playing players like 'Canito'' Nivez, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hurruitner in return for players suspended for the mess in the Pan-American Mar del Plata Championship, we won gold despite all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance at international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico did not dominate this level as Piculin did.
And this is without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
This is a very difficult question.
We had a very good young, including Julio Thoreau, Flora Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you think of your main achievement in the federation?
Participating in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 1990s BSN had up to 17 teams of the season.
What do you have to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, regionalizing smaller categories.
For example, that boys from Ponce play only in their field and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and that’s too much.
At least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and course for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, the sky, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his lead role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the Dallas television series, in which he embodied a businessman without principles, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil predatory farmer Jar Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980’s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. In the new season of Dallas, died on Friday evening due to complications caused by cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., by the studio produced by Dallas.
“Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, again playing the iconic role that he liked the most,” his family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was next to Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to everyone who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, affectionate and talented, and I will miss him very much.
“He was an original person and lived a full life,” Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted that he drank for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and he underwent a transplant.
Long before Dallas, Hagman gained fame on television thanks to his role as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie girl played by Barbara Eden, and begins to live with her under the same roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies who rarely aired, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included roles well-accepted by critics in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it is his workshop interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. Hedman brought Hagman to the top of fame.
The drama series of the CBS channel about the Ewing clan and other characters in his entourage was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot at J.R.", conceived to create hype around an episode full of emotions in which the Character of Hagman is almost killed, gave rise to international discussions and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped to attract a record audience to the series at that time.
When the answer was given in the episode of November 1980, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second number of views entertainment program in history, after the finale of "MASH" in 1983, attracted 50 million viewers.
It was a fellow J.R., Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. She was interrupted and then threatened to blame her for prostitution if she did not get out of town, but others also had reasons to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupt official with a charismatic smile: a dishonest entrepreneur and unfaithful husband who wanted his wife to be an alcoholic, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), placed on treatment.
“I know what should be on the J.R gravestone,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, “Here is an honest citizen J.R. Eugene."
That's the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also the heroine of the original series, recalled on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who are lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new issue of Dallas were shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT has not yet made statements about what will happen to the series after the departure of Hagman.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who shone in such classics as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theatrical stages of New York in the early 1950s, and then served in the British Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met a young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he named his memoirs, "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life.
“I didn’t turn there anything that would find it capable of hurting someone or in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients experiencing fear.
“I give them advice, give them courage, meet them when they go to surgery and after,” he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer some consolation, like "don't be afraid, it'll be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Begins course, which explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students investigate apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses, and bacteria, and global warming.
In this semester, when Professor of the religion Stuart Sharme decided to read the course about the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible lure: the end of the “long countdown” of the Mayan calendar, on December 21, which many people seized as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Sharma had no idea what was expected of him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a financial crisis that some call it “dolgoharmadeddon,” and the growing conflict, where Israel is involved, a place where Christian theorists at the end of time believe that the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it would be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University (New Jersey) this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world at present, as if we only had 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that the bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic way of thinking.
And he’s not the only professor who offers ‘end of the world’s “end” in this semester, theoretically the latest in history.
At Templa University, adjunct professor Barry Wacker reads the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way to which hypothetical scenarios that cause certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war may break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I tried to tell the students what might probably be plausible and impossible,” Wacker said.
At the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restalle and his colleague Amar Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, came together to read a course called simply the “End of the World”.
“We’re not adding ‘2012’ to always be able to read the course again if the end of the world does not come,” said Restalle.
Despite the “imminent destruction”, students must study, prepare projects and take final exams.
In Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students no choice but to work “until the very night at which the end of the world is supposed to come,” said Restalle.
The courses were quite popular.
“The seats ended in two hours,” said Restalle of his course for students with a high average score, which was signed up by 35 students.
We received emails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to console themselves,” said Bridgehead Robinson, a 23-year-old student in the Department of Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Vakez, a 25-year-old student at psychology and nursing, said he had seen all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a course that I’d teach,” he said.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed – not to mention the professor – said that he believes in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
“Our first project touched on the Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old retired student at Templa University of West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key moment in the calendar, said Restal.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic concern in Western culture, which dates back several centuries, where people react to changes around themselves, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
“In other places, people don’t think about it,” he said.
Mostly in the English world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at the University of La Salle, who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knows about any course about the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines is not taking part in the end of the world,” he wrote, hinting at the order of the higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
The restalle drew attention to the fact that for a long time it was talked about many days of the last trial, and said that if nothing happened on December 21, “people will immediately begin to think about the next date” or philosophize that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are careless about this date.
Some said they were going to go to the "end of the world" parties.
“Maybe I’ll call someone from friends to laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student at the communications faculty.
