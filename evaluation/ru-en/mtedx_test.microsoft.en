Yes, hello!
I am very pleased to be here, because I am actually a graduate of the Higher School of Economics, so I am doubly glad to see you.
Yes, I graduated from political science in 2007, and I'm very surprised at how many students there are on Friday night.
(Laughter) I, to my shame, especially in my first year, wouldn't keep you company.
(Laughter) My speech is also about the future, and I'm a little bit of a parrot of you — about a slightly gloomy future.
Do you know the company I work for, Kaspersky Lab?
Audience: Yeah.
Anton Shingarev: Okay, nice.
To understand the context: we are an international company, Russia for our market is only 20%.
We are one of the three world companies in the field of cybersecurity, consumer, and therefore my presentation is about such a global world. We are one of the best, thanks to our programmers, thanks to Russian education, in understanding the threat landscape, and we see the big picture.
I will tell you about the future from our point of view, about a slightly gloomy future, to be honest.
My presentation is called "The Digital Middle Ages" because, in our opinion, the era in which we now live, if you look at it from a digital point of view, is close to the Middle Ages.
Many things have already been invented, developed, but we still do not understand how to use it.
There are constant wars, attacks, in general, everything is quite sad, but it will be better.
It's for understanding the landscape — in general, what's happening in the cyber world right now.
This is data from our systems, from our library.
Over the previous 20 years, we have detected 1,000,000 samples of new viruses, now we are detecting 310,000 per day.
That is, everything that humanity has accumulated over the previous 20 years, if we talk about malicious specimens, we are now detecting it in a week.
In cyberspace, there is an explosive, very dangerous, serious growth of various viruses.
Users are being attacked more and more often.
Almost two-thirds of users were attacked in one way or another in the previous year, according to our data.
This is a serious figure.
Well, how many people are sitting here?
I don't know, 100?
Here, probably, the sample is not entirely correct, but if we take the global sample, two-thirds of users are attacked constantly.
Protection against these threats is becoming more and more complex.
That's our job, but it's getting harder and harder for us, because if it used to be just a relatively simple antivirus — a product that protects — it's a whole story now.
Now, to protect ourselves from these 310 [thousand] threats a day, we need to work hard, hard and seriously.
One more thing... All operating systems are at risk.
People often think that if you have a Mac, then you are out of danger.
It's not that. Of course, most threats are for Windows, far beyond 300,000,000 threats.
All other operating systems are also under attack.
Here it is worth paying attention to this system - Linux.
Few of the ordinary users use it - it is, rather, industrial systems and professional users.
This is very serious, and I'll talk about it a little bit later.
And a couple of other interesting numbers.
It's the damage of cybercrime.
The first figure, 400 [billion], is the data of the insurance company Lloyd, one of the world leaders.
$400,000,000,000 a year is Russia's two budgets this year.
If you count in the Sochi Olympics, one cost $50,000,000,000, that's [eight] Sochi Olympics.
And that's just for a year!
These numbers are growing and growing constantly!
A couple of stories about the attacks that we've seen.
This attack is called "karbanak".
A very interesting attack, if you can talk about criminals.
These people managed to steal almost a billion dollars in two years.
You know, when in Hollywood movies people imagine hackers, usually such a rather romantic image - a black hoodie, Red Bull, (Laughter) you sit, write code - this is all in the past, this is no longer the case.
This gang consisted of several dozen people.
They worked for a paycheck.
They had a five-day work schedule.
These people were hired via the Internet.
It's an organized criminal company, only it wasn't developing something good — it was stealing money.
These people managed to... This attack was mainly against Russian banks, Western European, Eastern European, around the world, but mostly Russian banks suffered.
These criminals managed to get into the very center of the protective circuit in the banks.
They infected the computers that are responsible for managing ATMs.
They could program ATMs so that they would give out money at a certain time.
With the help of webcams, they monitored what was happening around them.
They took screenshots of operations that bank employees did in order to then learn.
That is, they could monitor a particular bank for a month without robbing it.
For months, they watched him as everything happened.
Then, within a few hours, tens of millions of dollars were stolen.
A second interesting attack occurred on the Central Bank of Bangladesh last year.
It's pretty ironic.
We say it's the most expensive typo in history.
Learn well, not to steal, in general, to make mistakes badly.
The criminals were apparently illiterate, And English was their mother tongue.
And they made a mistake in the word "foundation" in the payment order: they missed a letter.
The clerk who processed it was a little surprised, because it was a payment in the amount of a billion dollars, and managed to block it.
But nevertheless, the "pathetic" 80,000,000 dollars managed to steal.
The attack was on 1,000,000,000, 80,000,000 were stolen - that's one attack.
And just think about it: this is an attack on the Central Bank, that is, because of one attack, $ 1,000,000,000 was withdrawn from the financial system of one country.
That is, this is no longer just crime, but a matter of national security and financial stability.
That's where we are now.
I'm not even telling you this now, it's about what happened a couple of years ago.
Now let's move on to a little more serious things.
Don't worry, I'm a political scientist, so I don't understand much technically.
It's all so roughly, both for you and for me, it will be clear to you.
APCS is an automatic process control system.
How does a modern factory work?
Of course, for example, steel – these are people, you know, do not pour everything with their hands.
There are computers everywhere.
A factory is one big computer.
I was very surprised, I have a friend who is a meat technologist, that in one of the last factories that he launched, where they make raw smoked sausage, there are 15 employees, half of whom are security guards.
Everyone else is a computer operator.
The modern pilot of an airplane, especially an Airbus, if we are talking about Airbus, is a computer operator.
There, the priority of decision-making in Airbus is on the pilot.
This, by the way, is what distinguishes Airbus from Boeing.
APCS is all about it.
Here is a module that converts the digital signal into an electric one and instructs the turbines to spin, the pistons to walk, the oil to be injected, and so on.
It's all called APCS.
What does it look like?
For example, this. Specifically, this is a nuclear power plant, but in fact, anything can look like this.
But in fact, the APCS looks like more than just that. This is also an APCS.
This year we were in Livigno, skiing.
And it's a home brewery.
Here, please, everything is controlled by a computer.
That is, computers are everywhere: a projector, lighting in the building, electricity, speakers.
Computers everywhere, computer systems everywhere.
Everything in the modern world is controlled by computers.
They sometimes get it wrong.
Here's a very funny picture.
Ports, of course, are modern – also computers.
All these giant cranes are controlled automatically.
The crane made a mistake and here... (Laughter) Here we were trying to figure out where it was, we assume it was either Hong Kong or Singapore, because, you see, the driver managed to jump off, (Laughter) when he realized that something was wrong.
That is, apparently, he jumped off - on the right the door, respectively, probably, right-hand traffic.
What's so bad?
Criminals attack ics TP.
They attack production, they attack transport systems.
An interesting story happened a couple of years ago in the port of Antwerp.
This is one fairly large European port.
In cooperation between Latin American drug cartels and European criminals – by the way, criminals are very good friends, this is a separate topic for the speech: if geopolitically Russia has relations with Ukraine, then criminals cooperate, exchange information, in general, everything is fine with criminals – so European criminals hacked the computer management system of the port of Antwerp.
They knew that the cocaine was put in one container.
The criminals knew in which container the drugs were placed, and unloaded it to a safe place using a computer, after which they calmly left.
That is, they hacked technological systems.
What does that mean?
This means that the next step, unfortunately, is terrorism and sabotage.
Because what do we have?
Highly professional computer gangs that can hack into the most serious systems.
Criminals hack into process control systems.
The next stage, unfortunately, is terrorism and sabotage.
There have already been several stories when real physical processes were attacked with the help of computer systems.
Perhaps what is most relevant to us is this attack: last December, a number of physical companies were attacked in western Ukraine, as a result of which equipment was physically destroyed due to a computer attack.
The criminals were able to completely erase all information about the customers of energy companies and reflashed the control system.
Fortunately for Ukraine, Ukrainian energy systems are quite outdated, as well as Russian ones, however.
So they just sent the mechanics to switch the levers.
Thanks to this, several areas were de-energized for only a few days.
If such an attack had taken place in Europe, it is difficult to say that the weeks would most likely have been without electricity.
Why are we here?
I painted a pretty scary picture.
All the systems we have, especially electricity, are all at risk.
Why is that?
The fact is that if you look at the cycle of creating innovations, when everything is created, we are somewhere here now.
That is, the systems that surround us: telephones, transport control systems, power plants, all this was created without thinking about risks, without thinking about computer security.
My colleagues said that it is probably the property of a person, when you think about the future, to see opportunities.
We unfortunately see the consequences of people seeing only opportunities.
You always have to weigh the risks and think about the possible consequences, so we're here.
Of course, this cycle will continue.
It will take some time, we will protect everyone, quantum computers will come up with them, I don't know, they will come up with many other things, and this cycle will come again.
But unfortunately, we are now in a world that is extremely vulnerable.
This is the kind of matrix that we have drawn for ourselves – a threat model, so to speak.
We divided into three areas everything that surrounds us: physical equipment, data and communications.
And according to the level of complexity, they were also divided into three categories.
The most important thing — the one on which the security of the country depends — is here.
And all this, unfortunately, is extremely vulnerable.
We have already seen attacks on the stock exchange with the aim of playing with the dollar rate.
This means that as a result of a computer attack, it is possible to adjust the financial situation in the country, or in the world, or in the region.
We've seen attacks on banks.
If I said about a billion stolen from the Central Bank of Bangladesh, and if I stole 10 billion?
And if it's 100 billion, what happens?
Transport, electricity and power grids.
Why is energy the most important?
Because if there's no energy, there's nothing.
And unfortunately, all the computer systems in this industry, they're outdated.
I don't want to scare you too much.
I hope I scared me in moderation, it's not so bad really.
Despite the fact that the government, let's say, those parts of the government that are responsible for the attacks, are already there.
We're sure they've already developed the means of attack, but it's not so bad until they're attacking, because it's a weapon that can be used once. We, as a company, see our task in protection.
And why am I telling you all this?
Just to make you wonder for a second what a fragile and interesting world we live in.
And I don't know which faculties you come from, probably from different ones, but, for example, in my field, I am always surprised at how much everything is dense and underdeveloped.
If you are lawyers , a lot of questions on jurisdictions, on responsibility, on intergovernmental agreements.
I am a political scientist, I am extremely interested in working in this area.
Mathematicians, economists, this is an extremely interesting area.
And think about it.
Think sometimes about how important it is to protect your data if you're a user and you're there, and behave accordingly.
Thank you, and I'm not leaving.
If you have any questions afterwards, please come up.
(Applause)
My story is called "365 Days."
I want to talk about how this year has changed me, changed my people and changed my country.
This story began exactly one year ago.
Yes, on the same day, June 20, 2013, I was sitting at my work, writing another note, and my colleague, Sasha Akimenko, came up to me and said: "We need to talk.
It's a very serious conversation."
What Sasha told me was very disappointing.
He told me about the impending deal and that tonight it will be announced that the Ukrainian media holding and Forbes magazine, in which I worked, is acquired by Kharkiv millionaire Sergey Kurchenko.
To say I was upset is probably an understatement.
The fact is that six months ago we wrote the first story about Sergei Kurchenko, about his rapid growth, about how he was engaged in smuggling petroleum products, how he robbed the state budget, about how millions of state money went into someone else's pocket.
And so, this man comes and one day buys my favorite publication, my favorite holding.
It actually deprives me of my job.
And, yeah.
At 23:30, the news about the purchase of the media holding appeared on the Forbes website.
What's next?
At that time, not quite pleasant processes in the media market were taking place in the country.
A month earlier, TVI journalists had resigned because of a raider takeover.
Then there was the deal to buy Forbes.
It is clear that the magazine "Correspondent" was also under attack.
We understood that the zone of freedom of speech was narrowing and that there were probably fewer publications every day where we could write.
And I wanted to write.
I had to write.
And there was already a story among journalists: my God, what are we doing?
Why are we doing all this, all these investigations, if no one needs them?
If the Prosecutor General's Office turns a blind eye to the facts of millions of losses of the state, and your holding company comes and buys the person who stole this money.
And you, at the same time, put your life in danger.
You endanger the lives of your loved ones, you are very worried about it.
You work day and night.
But the most important thing is that your articles do not find any response from people.
That is, society does not care and society does not understand that this is their money, which is stolen from their pocket.
I thought for a long time whether I should stay in the profession or not.
I had options to go to the United States of America, or get an education there, or find myself in another profession.
Sometimes there are stories when you are motivated by stories from a past life.
In my case, it was the story of my school.
I studied in Kerch, in Crimea, where I was the only Crimean Tatar woman in the class.
And she was subjected to harassment on the basis of nationality.
It was very hard and difficult for me.
And in ninth grade, I asked my mom to transfer me to another school.
The documents were ready.
In principle, the issue was resolved already, a day or two.
And my mom came into my room late at night and said, "Did you really decide you wanted to do this?"
I said, "Well, yeah, I can't do it anymore, I don't want to.
I can't stand it anymore."
And my mother said to me: "You understand that if you leave now, you will show your weakness, show your weakness and they will remain winners."
And then I decided to stay.
And I thought, if I accepted the challenge then, being a fifteen-star girl, why can't I accept it now?
The second story is the story of the book.
When I was eight years old, I read The Little Prince for the first time.
I loved this book.
I understood everything, except for one story - a story about a lamplighter on the planet.
And I went up to my parents with a book and asked them to explain what this lamplighter, this story, meant.
I understood everything, I like everything.
My mother, on the one hand, was glad that I read such serious books already at such an age, and on the other hand, I upset her a little.
She said, "How could you not understand that?
This is the most important story.
Go think."
So I read this book dozens more times, and of course I understood the story of the lamplighter.
It's about the fact that no matter what, this man lights this lantern every day, although he does not see the point in it.
I thought, I'm the same lamplighter on my planet.
Why shouldn't I light this lantern?
If I know how to write texts, why should I stop writing them?
And so I decided to create my own project.
It so happened that we announced HUBs on the eve of the revolution.
Then everything was absolutely incomprehensible.
We announced the project on November 25.
At that time, the protest was peaceful, only the Euromaidan began, there were hopes for the signing of the Association.
A lot happened in the next three months.
The state actively put sticks in my wheels, because I was not issued a certificate of registration of the media.
They wrapped me up, sent me some letters that the commas were incorrect, that we could not give you an application for registration.
When the dictatorial laws were passed on January 16, I thought that this was probably the end of it.
Because I definitely do not want to work in Belarus and, probably, the project does not make sense.
Do you know when I got my media registration certificate?
It is dated February 24, 2014.
That is, at the moment when Yanukovych fled the country, some person in the state registration service signed my certificate.
On February 24, another interesting event took place.
When my colleagues were fishing the documents of the escaped Yanukovych from the Kiev reservoir and drying them with hair dryers, I was rummaging through the garbage can in the Arena shopping center.
It looked like this. What was I looking for there?
The fact is that together with Yanukovych, the hero of our investigation with Sasha, Sergei Kurchenko, fled the country.
He ran so fast that he threw out in his shopping center, his employees threw out 40 bags of documents passed through the shredder.
This, of course, was a treasure trove for a journalist.
That's why I called it "golden garbage."
But I understood that in order to restore these documents, I would probably need to spend a lot of time.
I didn't understand at all whether it was possible to restore documents from a shredder.
Of course, I watched the movie "Margot" and saw Iranian children reconstructing photos of U.S. embassy staff.
But this story had a continuation.
Because, just a few days later, my colleague, Denis Bigus, took these documents, organized volunteers and created the stationery hundred project.
And just a few weeks later, I came to the Stationery Hundred.
I saw dozens of volunteers pasting papers that I found in trash cans.
I remember well a seventy-five-year-old grandmother who, with huge glasses, huge lenses, sat and glued these papers on a sheet.
And I thought, damn, a year ago I couldn't imagine this, because I thought that no one needed articles, that our society was passive, that I was doing some nonsense.
And then Grandma came and glued.
Did she even know a year ago who Sergey Kurchenko was?
I couldn't imagine it.
As I could not imagine that the first text on our portal will be the text "The last day of VETEK".
It was very symbolic.
But even more I could not imagine that at the same time in my native Crimea, three days after I finally launched my project, these events would begin.
But these events allowed another project to be born.
When the building of the Crimean parliament was seized on February 27, my friends Alim Aliyev and Tamila Tasheva and I gathered and decided to create the project "Crimea SOS".
We didn't know what was going to happen next.
We didn't understand at all what this situation was going towards.
At first, it was sent to inform, but then more and more volunteers joined it.
We began to help refugees, displaced persons, the military.
The history of Crimea SOS is not a story about us, really.
It's a story about you, about people.
Because I never in my life could have imagined that this story would resonate with thousands of caring people.
Because when you receive 600 letters a day, with the addresses of people who are ready to accept refugees, or when they call you from unfamiliar numbers and say: "Please accept 6 bags of potatoes from the city of Kovel at the Simferopol railway station", it is very inspiring and impressive.
On March 18, 2014, Crimea, my homeland, the homeland of my ancestors, from which we were expelled 70 years ago, became part of the Russian Federation.
The anexia of Crimea has officially entered into force.
Two months later, my people were banned from holding a mourning rally dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the deportation.
But people, despite this, came out on this day.
And helicopters circled above them.
People prayed.
People found strength in themselves, came and paid tribute to memory.
Did we stop our work after Crimea was annexed?
Of course not.
Just like I did a year ago, we continue to practice.
And thousands of caring people write to us every day and worry.
I don't know what will happen next, I don't know what will happen to Crimea next year.
The only thing I know is that even the faith of one person, the faith of two people, can do very incredible things.
Not to mention the faith of hundreds of thousands of people.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Our whole life is a continuous marathon in the dark.
You and I can only dream, believe and assume what our day will be like tomorrow, our life in a year, 10, 20 years.
And in order for all your plans and dreams to come true, you need to leave your comfort zone every day, expand the boundaries of what is possible and step into the dark, believing that there is a stepping stone.
There's an expression that if you want to have something you don't have right now, you have to start doing something you've never done before.
11 years ago, at a karate demonstration, I had an accident that led to a spinal injury and loss of movement on my legs.
For several weeks, different doctors gave me different diagnoses.
At the same time, I was prescribed a large bag of magic pills, but it didn't get any better.
And the psychological shock of realizing that my active, busy life with grandiose dreams, with plans, may not happen, covered me with my head every day.
Every morning of the new day, I was greeted with a choice: either accept everything as it is and adapt, or fight and believe that I can get back on my feet.
And then came the moment when I made a choice.
I threw away all the pills, I stopped listening to the sad conclusions of the doctors and began to look for a smart specialist who could help me.
And I found it.
Thanks to the knowledge of this doctor, thanks to the knowledge that I received at the institute – and at that time I graduated from the Academy of Physical Education and received a diploma in the specialty of a rehabilitation specialist – we began to recover.
There were different procedures, mental training, meditations, exercises.
And it took time before this whole system began to work and bear fruit.
And here is a very important thing: it is important to be able to find the strength in life to move on, to move forward, despite the fact that, it would seem, everything you do is useless and does not bring results right now.
In fact, I am grateful to God, I am grateful to the Universe for the fact that this incident happened to me, because a new level of understanding of human power and capabilities has opened up to me.
I discovered the knowledge through which I now help people.
And I made one very important and powerful discovery for myself: the choice of being, every day of your life, creates your actions, and your actions create results.
It's your life, it's what you have today, it's what you have every day.
To be, to do, to have.
And I encourage you to always take big peaks, always strive for dreams and pose great challenges.
And to do the deed, and to act every day.
And you know, the Bible says, "According to your faith and your works, you will be rewarded."
And it is. For 16 years I have been engaged in coaching, I help people realize sports fitness goals, I help to rehabilitate after injuries and diseases.
I just fall in love with sports and a healthy, active lifestyle.
Two years ago, on the eve of the Paralympic Games, the international organization BlazeSports America, which develops Paralympic sports around the world, held a two-day seminar in Moscow.
A good friend of mine threw me a link, thinking that it would be interesting to me as a coach, but, you know, this event - it opened a completely new milestone in my life and the lives of at least thirty other people in our country.
The seminar brought together athletes with different categories of physical limitations, as well as their coaches.
We, literally being in the shoes of these people, were able to try every sport and learn training methods.
There was basketball, wheelchair shuffleboard, volleyball sitting on the floor, goalball and football with a ringing ball for blind people.
a bocce game for people who have a strong degree of cerebral palsy.
It was very difficult, just unbelievable.
And you know, these athletes were amazing in their character, their will, their strength and perseverance.
I will even say more that their destinies and lives are real textbooks on authorship, leadership and team play.
They are always ready to support each other and they are very attentive to people.
At the end of the seminar, we were shown a documentary about how amateur Paralympic sport is developed and maintained in the United States of America.
No borders, absolutely everyone is on an equal footing.
Sports and fitness centers are adapted for everyone.
A large selection of sports clubs and sections, a large selection of competitions, an organized transfer.
And absolutely everyone can afford to engage in their favorite sport and lead an active sports life.
You know, I sat among our guys and I saw, and I realized how they missed all this.
Even tears streamed down my cheeks from understanding the problem.
And how much this environment is not developed and supported in our country, how difficult it is for these people, but they still struggle, do not give up.
And there are only a few of them.
And that's when I had an absolutely clear intention to change this situation in our country.
The idea of creating an organization that will develop and supervise Paralympic sports in our country is very firmly entrenched in my heart and in my head.
And I began to think about where to start.
Stumbling upon a video on the Internet about how two people - a blind man and his leader - together finished the Ironman distance in the triathlon, and this is - so you understand - 3.8 km of swimming in the sea in pairs, after that without a break they ride 180 km of bicycle race, and immediately after that without a break they run 42 km of marathon.
And that's when I knew where I was going to start.
In our country, there are about 13 million people with disabilities, about 400 thousand of them are people who do not have vision, or have some kind of vision problems.
Just think, this figure can be compared with a whole city in Russia, such as Sevastopol, Sochi, Nizhny Tagil.
And this figure: 70% of this population are young people of working age.
People of this category are cut off from the world as much as possible.
It is difficult for them to find a job, to realize themselves in life.
Many sports sections avoid taking such people to classes, because there is a lot of fuss with them: the organization of transportation, the search for leaders, volunteers, the difficulty in training, because these people do not see.
Both society and parents from childhood form the attitude of such people: you are disabled, and your life is appropriate.
You can't, you can't, you don't need to.
And that's when I came up with an idea where to start.
I decided to find a blind man who does not have sports training in order to prepare him from scratch for the marathon distance and run it with him in a pair.
Thus, the social project "Marathon in the Dark – from Omsk to Moscow" was born.
A young man Sasha Menshikov from the city of Omsk responded to my search.
I understood that such joint work would bring both of us to a qualitatively new level of personality and that for Sasha this marathon should be some big and important dream that would motivate and inspire him in difficult moments.
And so it was: Sasha dreamed of a marathon for 10 years.
He appealed to sports organizations, he wrote to people, coaches, he sought support, but he did not receive it.
Even friends and relatives waved their hands, said: "Sasha, you are blind, you will not be able to."
Although it was thanks to Sasha's inner ambition that at the age of 28 he received a higher medical education, studied to be a masseur, and now he works in a clinic and restores people.
He lifts children with a strong degree of cerebral palsy to their feet.
At the time of our acquaintance, Sasha was already living separately from his parents, renting a room.
We started with Sasha on December 6, 2013.
To date, he has three 10-kilometer races and one 21-kilometer half marathon behind him.
And on September 20 this year, at the Moscow Marathon, we will overcome the cherished 42 kilometers.
Surely you will ask: "How did you prepare?" Sasha is in Omsk, and I am in Moscow.
You know, here I will tell you a very important thing: when a person has a powerful vision, there is a dream, from the realization of which goosebumps run through the body, everything is found: there are opportunities, ways, people and most importantly – there is energy in order to act and move every day.
We have gone through a very difficult path of intrapersonal struggle with Sasha, in building relations between us, fighting with the attitudes and mentality of society and local authorities, in order to organize Sasha's training process.
Sasha became an incredibly open, purposeful and risky person.
He learned to trust himself and people.
He learned to think positively and smile and ask for support.
Six months ago, Sasha got married and moved to another city.
Now he lives with his wife in Yekaterinburg.
And just a couple of months ago, Alexander was able to catch up and detain a criminal who attacked him and wanted to take away his phone.
(Applause) (Cheers) This was written in many newspapers and Sasha was awarded an honorary award and a medal.
And now we have the finish line.
After the marathon, Sasha will reach an even higher level: he will have the experience of completing something very large and, it would seem, terrible and impossible.
And this experience he will be able to use further in life and bring it to other people.
And as a coach, as a leader, I will have tremendous experience of what I can be, so that this person succeeds, so that he entrusts his life to me and can realize his dream.
After all, when a blind person runs with a leader, he trusts him with his life, and for him this is a big risk, and for a leader it is a great responsibility that he can cope with.
Surely you will also ask: "Why running?" When a little man is born, he first learns to hold his head, sit, crawl, walk - stand, and then walk.
And then there comes a moment — everyone knows him — when he runs.
And at that moment, it's happiness for him.
It's life, it's joy, it's the state of "I can do anything."
Now imagine that a person could never do that.
In addition, running - it does not require complex equipment, only sneakers and a person nearby.
Running in a pair of leader and blind is about teamwork.
And two people is a team.
A team that has two main things: trust and support.
In addition, marathon running teaches day after day, step by step, to overcome difficulties, to endure and move towards big goals and dreams.
For the blind and the leader, running is a powerful tool for personal growth and transformation in life, and their results are an example and inspiration for ordinary people.
I gave you an example of one such fate, one person.
But our project "Marathon in the Dark" has existed for a year in Moscow, and in the near future there are other cities of Russia, and the development of amateur Paralympic sports for other categories of physical restrictions.
It is very important to me that you take two main things out of my statement today.
First.
Every day of your life you choose with your head.
It is in it, only in it, that you make absolutely all decisions.
[Choice in the head] In it, you choose actions or laziness, authorship or circumstances, strength or pity.
It is in it that you risk or fear, believe or doubt.
Remember the law: choice – being – action – result.
And so it is every day of life.
And then you will definitely succeed and absolutely everything will be possible.
Limits, impossibilities and limitations – they are only inside your head.
And the second thing.
Be in focus on the world around you.
Think of those who live in your or the house next door, those with whom your children study, those with whom you work.
Walking down the street, pay attention to passers-by.
And I'm sure you'll remember or meet people who need your support.
In our country, many people lack the simplest, but at the same time the most necessary thing is the support of their neighbor.
And then wings grow, and faith appears.
[Focus on the world] And if life is a marathon in the dark, where, taking a new step, you do not know what awaits you there, you do not know, but you believe that everything will work out, then believe me: together, three, to run this marathon of life is much easier and more effective.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hello, dear friends!
Yes, all this is true: the stages were not easy, but I coped.
And now I stand before you.
It's not that I want to tell you about all the stages of my formation, about future plans and so on; I don't think it interests everyone that much, although maybe it does, but it's going to take a very long time.
When we were thinking about how to characterize and explain my appearance on TEDx, we went through some musical themes, the connection of music with something, words with music, rhythms, all sorts of sounds, meanings, etc. and decided that we would talk about contourbabimus.
What is contourbabimus, you will find out a little later.
Maybe someone, of course, knows.
This is the connection of sound, words with musical sounds, with rhythms, and how sound, even if it does not have a specific meaning – for example, for us the word "contourbabimus" does not make any sense now – but it already has a certain mood, and it is this mood that often gives new unexpected musical thoughts that you could not predict in advance.
Moreover, the word "contourbabimus" has a very specific meaning.
But today, during our performance, compositions will be performed in which words mean nothing at all.
And it's not because I don't have enough verbal abilities.
Let's say that's not the case. And this nonsense, as it would seem, it makes it possible to focus the attention of performers and listeners on the combination of sounds, words incomprehensible, some allusions that these words give.
It's this kind of amazing, something new that, in general, is not there.
We are not the first – I speak on behalf of a group of people, because we are now going to perform with a small choir of my friends – we are doing this, but it seems to me that we have achieved great heights precisely in singing meaningless words to incomprehensible proto-ethnic motives.
And we'll start with a song called "Manig": it doesn't make any sense at all, it would seem.
But in fact, the meanings are so deep that I think you will be shocked now.
I'll invite my friends to this stage: it's a choir and a pianist.
(Applause) So, Manig: penetration into the intimate, immersion in the bottomless.
(Music) (Applause) So, we continue to talk about the connection of words and the completely unexpected achievements that those words of the unknown give.
When I studied for a short time at the Merzlyakov School, we had a wonderful teacher Konstantin Korzun, who went on unique folklore and ethnographic expeditions, explored all sorts of songs in the depths of Siberian ores, brought recordings of both sheet music and canine recordings – all this was terribly interesting.
And in his book, which he showed us, I dug up an amazing motif that I had never heard, and I don't think many people had heard it, because everything that was in this man's books, no one had ever heard.
And it was amazing, although the music is wonderful.
And on the basis of this motive, there were a few words at the beginning: "Oh, the head hurts ...", and the meaning was not very clear at all.
And in general, I would like to say a few words about the fact that often the meaning of what we sing, a song is much better sung, if you do not understand the meaning.
That's always been the case, at least in my case, with the Beatles.
I rarely understood, especially as a child, what was going on there.
And even with age, I thought: let's sit down to figure it out, I began to understand, and somehow this did not give me any additional inspiration.
And often many people have noticed that in translations many songs sound very strange.
And they sound strange not because the language is bad, but precisely because this language sings this music worse.
Like some famous (Sings) Che gelida manina, se la lasci riscaldar, and in Russian it sounds like this: "Cold stream, you need to warm it."
Well, I mean, that's not the case at all.
(Laughter) Therefore, despite the fact that there are all sorts of successful translations, in general, the language itself often dictates the rhythm and melody of things.
So it's amazing to watch it and get into it and to participate in it is a separate amazing interest.
Now the composition I was talking about, "The Head Hurts", will be played, composed, developed, and in it just these meaningless words, they create some amazing vague proto-folk-ethnographic mood, which at first fascinated me, then all my friends, and now we will present this song to you.
So, "My head hurts."
(Music) (Sings) Oh mommy, my head hurts, Oh my head hurts, oh my head hurts.
My head hurts, I want to walk, Oh li oi lyuli, but I can't.
My heart is hot, I want to love, Oh or oi lyuli, but I don't know who.
Ay in the field I will go, where the sun is rolling, Maybe in the field he will meet me.
And the third part of our story is about a very amazing experiment.
Once upon a time, my mom said to me, "If you have nothing to do, read Thornton Wilder's wonderful book, The Ides of March."
I began to read, I was carried away by this wonderful language in letters.
And there I found the three-verses of Gaius Valerius Catullus, which, of course, I heard myself for the first time, and it made such a deep impression on me – just poems in Latin – that I memorized them.
Now I'll prove to you what I memorized.
It's a piece: Soles occidere et redire possunt, nobis, semel occidit brevis lux, nox est perpetua una dormienda.
Probably, many of you know that there are two different schools: St. Petersburg and Moscow, how to pronounce Latin.
As we all know, St. Petersburg residents always have their own view, Muscovites have their own.
St. Petersburgers, I will explain, always read "c" as "k", and Muscovites - as "ts", if there is an "e" or "i" after them, or as "k" if "o", "a" or "u".
That's the difference.
Of course, there are still many differences, but we decided to stick to the Moscow school of reading the language, because we decided that it, of course, is better.
(Laughter) (Applause) Thank you!
I knew I would be supported in this room.
The Moscow school is better.
And then, after a while, I remembered it again, found all the text on the Internet, read it, found translations of it.
It amazed and inspired me in an absolutely amazing way how beautiful it is to sing in a language that you don't understand at all.
The fact that there is a translation there, you still do not correlate what is written there in Russian and what is written in Latin.
Therefore, it is this state: what you sing in an unknown language, some amazing phrases, it, in my opinion, gives some additional musical and semantic delight.
And that's why we now want to present you another lyric-dramatic etude called "Vivamus".
In the middle of this immortal work will sound the word "contourbabimus", with which we have titled our speech.
So, "Vivamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus": "We will live, my Lesbia, for now..." – unfortunately, I did not learn Russian.
"We are alive as long as we love."
So, come on, Olechka.
(Music) (Applause) Thank you very much, dear friends!
It was our small excursion into the combination of sounds, words, rhythms and meanings.
Thank you!
(Applause)
I've already been introduced, and now it's my turn to say hello.
I'll start by saying hello to the 30,000,000,000,000,000 bacteria present here.
I don't usually do that, but today is the case.
And then I'll say hello to 300 listeners.
Those 30 quadrillions, 100 trillion for each of you, are in your gut, and in addition to all the other bacteria that are present here, let's just say it's going to be the electoral majority.
So, guys, hi!
Like contourbabimus, there's a word that's not yet known to you, microbiota.
A microbiota, or microbiome, or metagenome, sometimes variously called, are bacteria that live somewhere.
It could be the cheese that these bacteria make.
It could be the gut that I'm going to talk about.
Forests, meadows, seas – we are accustomed to the fact that bacteria live everywhere.
We will have a live broadcast from the MCC: bacteria also live in space, in those places that are difficult for us to imagine!
There are studies about bacteria that can live in nuclear reactors, that is, wherever there is at least something that can be digested, our friends settle down and digest it.
Why is this important to us now?
The first bell rang in the mid-2000s.
Here is written about epidemiological obesity in the United States: from the 90s to the 2000s, the proportion of people diagnosed with obesity rose from 10 to 30%.
One group of scientists suggested that perhaps this is due to bacteria that live in the intestines.
The result of the work of these scientists was that bacteria are directly related to what is happening.
It seems that the widespread use of antibiotics in everyday life leads to the fact that bacteria die a little, function incorrectly, and people gain mass even from the modest amount of food that Americans consume.
This is very similar to the subtherapeutic effects of antibiotics that are used in animal husbandry: you give animals some antibiotics, and they gain mass.
Then the same meat comes to us.
No natural resource supervision, Russian, American, can notice these subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics.
And we continue to gain mass just like these animals.
Another reason why bacteria can die, die, and why I remember and talk about it here, are preservatives.
On the screen is the 137th day of the project "Happy Mil".
The food, as far as I remember, looks about the same as it did on Day 1.
Why?
Because it is not eaten by bacteria, it does not rot, does not deteriorate.
If this food gets inside, the same thing happens with our bacteria.
They don't eat it, they rather die.
And the take-home message is that it is worth eating that food that spoils, but before it spoils.
It is very interesting that in our culture there is such a thing as hygiene.
[Hygiene theory] On the screen is a well-known illustration, a classic version.
Now the theory of hygiene is being put forward in Europe, where they say that a huge number of allergies, food allergies, eczema and diseases of the younger generation are associated with the fact that in childhood they are kept in complete purity.
It turns out that our microbes train our immunity after we are born.
And if we do not encounter them, then the immune system becomes unable to perceive all sorts of substances in adulthood, and perceives all this as enemies.
There are positives.
Even in Russia, they do it: a microbiota transplant or a fecal transplant is a good headline for news feeds.
Its essence is that the bacteria of a healthy donor are cleared of feces and a patient with acute diseases receives them.
Now this is how acute forms of infectious diseases are treated, which are no longer amenable to any treatment.
And only by populating the intestines with healthy bacteria, you can drive out the bad ones from there.
And another no less interesting fact, which has so far been mastered only on rodents, is the influence of ... and there are also women who ate yogurt, but I'm doubtful (Laughter) - ... microbes were transplanted from rats that behave passively to rats that behave actively.
Everything was done qualitatively and painlessly.
And rats that were passive became active, gaining a microbiota, and vice versa.
There have also been changes in the brain that lead to this.
Two weeks ago, The Wall Street Journal cited very good scientific work by American colleagues who collected microbes throughout the American subway for 36 months.
It turned out that these microbes give us all the information about what is happening in New York.
If the station flooded once upon a time, marine microbes live there.
If one of the important routes of pizza carriers passes through this station, you will find there microbes that live and make cheese in pizza, for example, make Parmesan cheese.
And for 36 months, they observed the bacteria that Americans get sick with when they go to work in the morning.
The story is that our microbes contain all the information about the environment where they live.
That's pretty much what we do.
And what's more, we perceive our microbes in the gut as a new additional organ of the human body.
We are researchers all over the world.
What were we interested in at first?
Track microbes in the gut as humans moved across the Earth.
Will we find differences or something special from the Chinese, Russians, Americans, etc.?
As a result, observing the change in microbes on different continents, we have created a technique that allows us to look at the adaptation of these microbes to different environmental conditions.
The important thing I would like to say is antibiotics.
We can see that the microbes in the picture on the right adapt very well.
We have patients before and after antibiotic treatment.
For example, you have harmful bacteria in your lungs, you cure them.
In the intestine, resistance to these antibiotics appears.
The next time you get sick, antibiotic resistance is likely to be passed on to lung bacteria too – parasites will be difficult to fight.
We also see adaptations to all sorts of chemicals that are not found in nature, it seems that microbes save us.
They help us remove heavy metals from ourselves.
Chronic inflammation – these are, for example, intestinal diseases – microbes adapt to these harsh conditions of chronic inflammation and help us live in this moment.
One of the great works that I like, I don't have time for this, is that microbes adapt to the high doses of alcohol characteristic of the Russian Federation.
(Laughter) I was invited to TEDxMoscow a long time ago, and I kept thinking about how to connect everything I like and talk about it.
I found that the slogan of TEDxMoscow is "possible is everything."
It turns out that this is very similar to the slogan of one sporting event in which I take part – "anything is possible" – this is a long-distance triathlon race.
You must first swim 4 km, then pedal 180 km, then run a marathon for 42 km.
Here's my picture at the finish line.
Really anything is possible.
I, not a sporty person at all, finished in 13 hours and 20 minutes – it took up the whole daylight hours.
Why was this possible?
Largely due to the huge number of gadgets that are now used in the training of athletes.
In the picture is what I have: pulse, pressure, number of steps, torsion speed on a bicycle, power, etc., that is, there is a feedback, focusing on which, you can develop and train.
The new word derived from feedback is biofeedback.
Biofeedback is used mainly in cognitive sciences, where, with about the same thing as I have on my head now, you can exercise with your brain, recognizing different electromagnetic waves, and reach a level of self-mastery about the same as Tibetan yogis.
And I thought, cool, I'm going to tie it all together now, the microbiota, Iron Man and meditation.
Do we have a similar way to get feedback about our own microbes in order to develop such a natural self as possible, as in the picture on the right?
And it turns out there is!
That is, indeed, what we are doing now, scientists and young entrepreneurs, we are creating such methods of biofeedback.
There are several companies abroad that do this very coolly, some of them crowdfunding, where people themselves invested money in the beginning to get the first test results.
All this will now cost less and less, and in the near future we will see it abroad and in Russia.
Ohmygut.ru is our own project.
The site does not yet work, like any beginning projects, but if you write it down, I think tomorrow it should appear.
(Laughter) Here is this FSBUN and several commercial companies that are engaged in the production of high-level medical kits and the creation of information analysis, they create something similar in Russia.
Maybe it will be even better than foreign counterparts.
In conclusion, there are only two slides left, and I have 1 minute and 47 seconds, I would like to say about one of our pilot studies, which shows that we are what we eat.
We took residents of Russian cities and real deep villages up to the Old Believers – these are people who have not encountered industrial food.
Yeah, we've been trying to find some.
And it turned out that those people who live in the city, they have microbes exactly the same composition as Americans and Europeans; that is, the food genocide to which we are subjected as a result of globalization leads to the fact that the microbiota becomes poorer, thinner, bad, and it is about the same all over the world – this leads to the widespread emergence of all kinds of diseases.
People in each individual village live with their traditional composition of microbes, feel very good.
And maybe that would be the way for us to go to the countryside, live there quietly, turn off Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp... And learning to listen to ourselves: smelling ourselves, feeling hungry when we're sick — it's better to sleep when we don't want to eat — it's better not to eat.
If it's food, we want to eat it — we eat it, if not, we don't eat it.
In the modern world, our path of evolution, it seems to me, is aimed at the fact that we must learn to listen to ourselves in these conditions, when the flow of information is absolutely huge around us.
Perhaps now it is difficult to do this without special devices, so why not use them?
And in such a super-city of the future, it's really possible is everything, and I think the key is that we have to learn to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions and listen to ourselves with or without devices.
Good luck.
And don't get sick.
(Applause)
Hello!
An impressive performance about pigs.
All the way, as I watched, I thought how much more convincing it would be if there was a pig on stage that talked about its own achievements.
I have two sons.
A few years ago, they asked to be sent somewhere to study football.
Not in the sense that they had the idea of becoming footballers, but in the sense that they just wanted to learn how to play football: hit the ball, give a pass, that's all.
And I began to study the sections, what is there at all.
And it turned out an interesting thing that there are professional academies: "Spartak", "Dynamo", "CSKA".
There are some district sections, but they are all arranged according to the same principle: "We need a strong, successful player at the output.
To do this, we give children maximum physical and psychological stress.
All weaklings are eliminated: only strong, agile and hardy are eliminated."
That's understandable logic.
It worked well in the Soviet Union.
She worked in Europe 40 years ago.
They invented it in Sparta, where it also worked perfectly.
But it stopped working in Europe and America and now it has stopped working in Russia, simply because society has changed.
Imagine yourself in the 50s, in a small town like Manchester.
You have a child and options: either the child grows up and goes to the factory, or you give him to sports. No other, what is called social elevators, practically did not exist.
Universities are for the rich, so go work in a factory.
Therefore, parents, for the sake of a ghostly chance that their child would grow up strong, dexterous and become rich, were ready to endure the fact that their child was shouted at, and he should experience pain and everything else.
But society has changed.
And now when a teenager, having invented some application for the phone, the next day can wake up as a world-famous billionaire, there are countless ways to get rich, become famous, achieve success: they are just appearing.
Universities began to take not only the rich, but also the smart.
Accordingly, now parents do not want their children to be yelled at, to be beaten, to make the child feel bad and all the rest.
What you see is a quote from the boy Roger, ["I was the worst kid, I didn't obey, Threw tantrums, almost all the time I was yelled at and kicked out of training."]
who remembers his childhood and talks about his sports.
You all know this boy very well.
His last name is Federer, he grew up and became the best tennis player on the planet.
And this boy, Alexander, his memories are similar.
They know him much less than Roger.
"I hated those workouts.
We had one exercise: you drive the ball and hit the goal.
No one could score.
I scored.
The coach said I was leading the ball like a piece of shit."
This is my friend, journalist Alexander Borzenko.
And in fact, what unites them is not that one became a champion, and the other went into journalism.
It's something they both faced with: "In order to become an athlete, you have to go through very serious psychological and physical stress."
I wasn't ready to give my children to this, and I wondered how it could be arranged and how it works in Europe.
And in this sense, the example of Belgium is indicative.
The Belgium national football team suffered a number of shameful defeats in the late 90s at the qualifying championships of Europe and the world.
And then in Belgium they thought and realized that the problem is not in the "bad players".
And the problem is that they create "bad footballers".
They adopted a program: they hired a foreign company that once a year certified the academies of all football clubs.
Everything was taken into account: infrastructure, the number of children, the happiness of children, the progress of children, parents' feedback, whatever.
If the academy scored high, the club received privileges in the form of taxes, premises and everything else.
If the academy received bad grades, the club was deprived of privileges up to fines.
The system isn't perfect, but it has created competition.
And competition has changed the system: the system of "we take children now and in 10 years we have to give a superstar" turned into a system of "we have children, there are a lot of them, and they should be happy, and we also teach them football."
The happiness of children and their feeling of what is happening has become much more important than what will happen to these children.
This was not taken into account in the attestation commission.
And in this regard, the following happened: for 14 years in Belgium, a generation of the most talented football players in Europe at the moment was brought up.
They are young stars.
They play in the best European clubs.
And the Belgian national team at the last World Cup reached the quarterfinals, which included eighteen 22-year-old boys.
There is another team that failed in the late 90s at the championships quite shamefully.
Some of you may have watched the Russia-Japan match on Manege Square.
But, in general, as you know, nothing happened to this.
And when it became clear that the happiness of children works in professional football, I wondered if it could work in amateur football.
Is it possible to create a center where children would come just to learn football without the goal of becoming a football player?
Is it possible to make a place where individual achievements will be more important than collective ones.
Is it possible to make a place where a fat, awkward girl scores a goal for the first time, and it's as important an event as when an athletic boy scores 5 goals through himself in a fall?
And my friend Sasha Borzenko and I, whose memories you saw here, made such a football section for our children and the children of our friends.
Quickly enough, we discovered that not only we needed it, but also some other adults and children.
We had a lot of kids.
And we found the gorgeous and beautiful Alla Filina, who is a professional football coach.
She's as crazy as we are, because she also works as a development director for a large company.
But in her madness, she went further than us and received a professional coaching education.
And together we made a football center, where a lot of children come, and who learn football from us.
And then we discovered the amazing.
Very different children come to us, these children come from very different families.
Most of them would never have faced football, simply because... well, who in attendance would want their child to be a footballer?
Not "played in Bayern", but "was a footballer"?
We found an amazing thing: when you give a child the loads that he can withstand, without requiring him to make super efforts, then he begins to make these super efforts himself.
And we formed a group that we called the group "Love".
These are children who study with us for more than ten hours a week.
They go to competitions, to training camps and everything like the real ones.
But they are not shouted at, they are not required to make super efforts, if they themselves are not ready for them.
And it seems that this whole thing really works, because when Manchester City and Bayern Munich came to Moscow, they, among other things, this is a separate story, visited us.
They looked at our children.
And now by agreement, we are waiting for some time until the children grow up, and we will show them to Bayern Munich and Manchester City, and maybe some of them will go there to play.
(Applause) That's not all.
But thanks anyway.
And what all professionals who train children in Russia actually say is that if a child is not given high loads, he will never cope with them himself.
And there is only one chance.
And in this regard, I want to tell the following story.
Here is a photo of a black boy who was transported from Africa to Europe at a young age.
He played for..., from nothing to do, for the children's team, then for the youth team, then played in the 2nd division.
And he was unremarkable at all.
He didn't succeed, he was already 24 years old.
This is the time when footballers end their careers if they don't succeed.
But then he started to succeed, he suddenly started scoring.
He became the top scorer of the second division, then moved to the first French division.
He became the top scorer.
Then he was bought by the football club "Chelsea", and then together with "Chelsea", becoming the best football player in England, won the Champions League.
His name is Diego Dragba.
He did so at an age when professional footballers end their careers.
This story is about the fact that, in fact, each of us has his own time for chances and his chances in life.
And do not rush to them, they will come.
The last photo of a child I want to show you is a boy Grisha, he is 8 years old.
He's been working at the center we've done for 2 years now.
And he is engaged in the senior group.
He plays against children who are 2-3 years older than him.
This is my son.
If he is offered to play at Bayern Munich, I will be happy about it, but if not, if his football career ends with such a sport, I will not be upset, but hope that his memories of sports training will be a little different.
Thank you!
(Applause)
In general, not everyone knows, but I am 16 years old.
Many of you were probably 16 years old.
(Laughter) You know, it's such an age, there are different problems, all the cases.
And one of them... Let's say my day... in general, I myself do not know how to wake up.
It's a normal morning.
My father wakes me up and says, "Osman, good morning!
Who are you going to be?" Okay, okay.
I go to the kitchen.
Dad puts scrambled eggs there and asks, "Osman, who are you going to be?" He walks me to school and then, "Study well.
Who are you going to be?" You know, this question has been bothering me for days.
This has been going on for several years.
I think my father got his way.
I finally thought about his question.
That was a few years ago.
As an ordinary teenager, I decided: well, why do I need parents?
Why ask them for advice?
Why do I need relatives and adults?
I went to my friend's house.
I was in ninth grade somewhere.
I approached Kolka.
Kolka is an eleventh grader.
Me: "Kolka, you're a smart adult.
Can you help me in some way?
I have such a problem."
He looked at me with his gaze, "I, Osman, am smart.
May I help you.
You're going to need intelligence, hard work, diligence, love and alcohol."
A what?!
What for?!
I was just waiting, of course, for alcohol.
But my father is sitting in the audience.
So I'm going to skip this topic.
(Laughter) I hope you understand.
(Applause) Then the question arose for me: how would I solve this problem myself.
And the [obvious answer] to me was, let's see the future.
I think in five years, literally, economists will be right there.
I'm going to get rich.
Everyone in the economists will want to.
Everyone will need economists.
Economists will rule the world.
But!
How could I say that?
The world is changing so fast that I don't know what will happen tomorrow.
Suppose at the age of six I could never imagine that people would be able to play with their toys, computers, anything and make money from it.
So what now?
E-sports, YouTube, all this is developing, and people earn huge money on it.
Kids go to computer clubs, think: "Now I will play a game and earn."
That's how the world has changed.
Then for me there is a second way - I don't know how it is for you - working.
Then I think: I have a year left to finish my studies.
Dad will come up to me, of course, under the 11th grade and say: "Osman, hold on, here's a one-room apartment for you.
Live.
We give you canned food, pickles.
You're going to have everything, everything's fine."
It's cool!
What's the big deal?
That's cool.
I won't have to sweat.
But I'm not that kind of person and I wouldn't want to hang around my parents' neck.
I think you do too.
So for me, that way is dismissed.
Then there's a third way for me: do what I like.
With this motto, I lived somewhere from the first to the sixth grade, in general.
(Laughter) It was you know what?
I'm sitting in first grade thinking, "Yeah!
Basketball, basketball.
I'll go play basketball.
I love that."
Once abandoned, two abandoned.
So a year passed, I quit.
Oh my gosh, Osman, you're as short as you were.
Why would you do that?
I don't like it at all.
To hell with basketball.
I decided, I'm going to go to the music room.
I'll play something on the guitar.
The soul of the company, all the affairs, as everyone thinks.
I played like that for a year. I played two.
Well, almost three — and quit.
Why would I do that?
Then I felt sorry again.
I went back to some sport. Swimming, sort of.
And a year later, I literally quit it again.
And for me, that's the problem of that way.
If I continue to give up what I do, what I like now, it will be useless in the future.
And maybe each of you has encountered it.
I don't know about you, but I don't have the passion of life that I'll be engaged in forever.
And then I decided: we need to fundamentally consider this problem.
And how to fundamentally consider the problem?
Back to childhood.
Let's say this cube, I hope everyone sees, this cube — let's call it "Osman".
He is so good, beautiful, born in 2000.
What happens to him?
Anyway, how was that?
He was a year old, two, three.
So what happened?
He saw the TV.
He sits on the mat like this, watching TV there.
God you are mine!
He looks at the cartoon "Toy Story", and sees: this is my hero!
Buzz Lightyear, that's it!
I want to be Buzz Lightyear.
I'll be Buzz Lightyear.
And at that moment, the cube of his life, the Cube "Osman", turns.
Ten minutes pass, he watches the next cartoon: "Well, wait!".
Looks: Oh, wolf, oh, hare.
I want to protect hares.
Turned the cube again. Watching another cartoon, the cube turned again. Watching another cartoon, the cube turned again. And so it goes on until first grade, until his sixth birthday.
And the Cuban Osman walks into school and hears from his friend Petit: "Osman, basketball is cool.
They make a huge amount of money.
They're athletes.
Go basketball."
I think, well, great.
I twist the cube.
Then he hears about ten minutes later at the next break from his friend: "No, basketball is not a high at all, they earn less than football players.
Let's play football," the cube turned again. Then his parents gave him to the music room.
The cube turned again. Spins, spins, spins, spins... And he gets to 11th grade.
The cube is already disassembled.
Actually, I don't even know how to assemble it.
And you know what's scary?
I'm in tenth grade now, and I imagine what will happen in one year.
I have graduation.
All happy, all the chores, the costume... And at some point he will say, "Osman, go!
Make money!" (Laughter) You're laughing, but what about ... (Applause) And what forbids some CEO in a computer program to say: "Well, programmer, go, go.
Your work is extinct.
Robots do everything there.
Go!" nothing gets in the way.
We're similar in that.
Each of us is at some point, say, A and is afraid that, having moved to point B, his profession will no longer be in demand.
I'm 16 years old, I have time to experiment.
(Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) And then I thought, "Osman, we need to come up with a brilliant way.
Something so cool that you and everyone will like it."
And at that moment, I thought about it.
Suppose in a year or two, maybe four years, I will receive, say, an economic education.
Do you see that line that's in front of you?
It will be an economic education.
My red diploma, maybe blue, I don't know.
And if I, after graduating from my university, continue to work for several years as an economist, then I will continue to twist one line.
I'll twist and turn and get to retirement.
That's it.
So what am I going to do next?
I forget about this part of my cube that I played basketball, swimming, guitar and the like as a kid.
And a hot topic... (Laughter) The actual thing at the moment is - a good example: there were two guys a few years earlier, I don't remember exactly.
They were engaged, for example, in economics.
One facet was their economic.
Another facet of them was neurobiology.
And the other, third facet, was engaged, for example, in psychology.
And these guys, combining the three facets of their cube, created a new science, like neuroeconomics, which is now developing quite quickly.
There are new professions, new places.
People appreciate neuroeconomists, they are in demand, they are needed.
And so, I would like to show you that instead of looking, choosing some profession, you can create your own, where you will use every face of your cube as efficiently as possible.
Realize yourself completely.
And, having created your profession, you will not need to choose.
Thank you!
(Applause)
In 2012, there was an event that completely changed my life.
I was riding in the Moscow metro, and my grandmother was sitting in front of me.
My grandmother stared into my eyes, after a while she lowered her gaze lower, then she smiled, got up from her seat and said: "Girl, sit down, you still need it, you are waiting for the baby."
I, holding my future baby, sat in her place, and that's how I reached the final station.
On the one hand, nothing strange happened.
Grandma just gave way to a pregnant girl on the subway.
But in fact, everything [was] completely different, because when I sat in her place, I was holding not my unborn child, but 133 burgers, 838 sandwiches, some unreal number of pizzas that I just ate over the past few years.
This is what I looked like then, a few years ago, and you will ask that there was such a terrible thing in my life that I brought myself to such a state.
In fact, everything in my life was fine.
By the age of 25, I graduated from the Faculty of Journalism of Moscow State University, I worked in Moscow, I was a glossy journalist.
I talked to all the stars from Keanu Reeves to Alla Pugacheva, I had my own show.
And my last place of work was the project "Top Model in Russian", which was led by Ksenia Sobchak.
As part of this project, we went to New York, Miami, London, everything was just wonderful, but inside me there was always a feeling that this was not my life.
And I constantly felt like my real life hadn't started yet.
And then, after this cult grandmother gave me a place in the subway, I just packed my things and left for my hometown of Ufa.
There, as they say, I searched for myself for several years, conducted research, got slimmer, completely changed my attitude to life.
I lost weight, got rid of bad habits and now I help other people achieve personal changes in different areas.
And now I want to tell you how to take this first step, the most difficult step.
Sociologists interviewed 12 thousand people 65-70 years old, and they asked them one simple question: what do you regret most in life?
And it turned out that all people at the end of life regret the same things.
Let's take a look at the regret rating.
So, all people regret that they worked in an unloved job, lived with unloved people, traveled little, played little sports and did not eat well.
Mind you, no one regrets drinking little or posting enough photos on social media.
No one regrets that he did not post enough photos of food on Instagram or that he jumped with a parachute.
Everyone regrets the same things.
Only about the fact that I did not have the courage or strength to change our lives and start living the life we want.
I have identified for myself 2 main "stops" that prevent us from starting this new life.
It's the expectation of a miracle and fear.
As for the expectation of a miracle: in my past life, despite the fact that I was fine, I had such a dream.
I dreamed that one day someone would call my life, I would open the door, there would be a beautiful young man who came in a Bugatti, and he would tell me: "I am a courier from the Mikhail Prokhorov Foundation.
Mikhail found out that you are a terribly talented person, and anonymously he gave you 5 million rubles: this is for you to find yourself.
Do not deny yourself anything: buy a card to a fitness club, go somewhere on the islands, do what you want, just because you are so talented, you do not need change, "says the courier, gets into Bugatti and leaves for the sunset.
I walked for several years, thought about the fact that this courier would come to me or someone in a blue helicopter would fly, although in Russia, as you know, only Shoigu flies in a blue helicopter, and then only in emergency situations.
In general, no one came to me.
I even came up with an alter ego that lives with each of us. This man's name is Tomorrow, he looks something like this. He's the kind of Superman who lives in us, he's willing to do anything, he's ready to conquer the world, but tomorrow.
Tomorrow he goes shopping with us, he chooses sneakers because we want to start running tomorrow morning, of course.
But for these sneakers, Tomorrow came up with his own insidious plan: he had already found the darkest, dustiest corner in the pantry for these sneakers.
And tomorrow morning, when we are just about to take this first step and start our new life, he in the morning, gently hugging us by the stomach, says: "Listen, let's go tomorrow!" And so our life passes day after day, and then we become 70 years old, we find that for 40 years we worked in an unloved job, that we lived with an unloved person,  that we have cholesterol plaques on the heart and that in principle, of the main achievements of our whole life, only that we have 123 "likes" on the avatar "Vkontakte" and some kind of grown farm in applications.
That's it.
So, about fear: I really like the idea that businessman George Eddair expressed.
He said, "Everything you need is on the other side of fear.
There is a chasm between your present life, the one you want to live, and the life you are living now.
And the only way to bridge this gap is to believe in the result.
And in order to believe in the result, you need to take a step into this abyss. "
No one I know has succeeded without this step into the abyss.
It needs to be done, and we are all afraid.
When I left Moscow, I had a very big fear, like many people who suffered early success.
I had a fear that I would run out of money.
In general, in our world it is not customary to say that you do not have money, because if you are 25 and you do not have money, then you are like a loser a little.
So I was very scared that I was going to run out of money.
And they're really over.
But at some point I realized that no one died, no one got sick with consumption, nothing terrible happened.
I just learned to go to the store with my bags, to change the heels on my shoes myself.
And everything was just fine!
I was just doing what I was looking for, what I like to do for real.
So how do you take the first step toward a new life?
For me, the perfect metaphor for change is a golf ball.
Why is it so remarkable, a golf ball?
If at the beginning of its trajectory it deviates literally by a millimeter, then by the end of its trajectory it can reach a curvature of several meters.
In the same way, a person does not need to make any grandiose changes now in order to get a brilliant new life after a certain amount of time.
It is enough for a person to take a small creative step now in order to get 100% of the changes in a year.
A friend of mine had this problem.
He was 34 years old, his business collapsed, his wife left him, and he, as he himself says, was so stooped that he even stopped brushing his teeth.
And at some point, he decided that he needed to start doing at least something, at least something creative, in order to rise from this bottom.
And then he decided for himself: "I will just brush my teeth normally in the morning and in the evening."
And he started brushing his teeth.
Then behind these teeth came the strength to do exercises.
Then he started reading books that he really didn't like to read.
So he had a new environment behind these books.
And in the end, the new environment led to the fact that he rebuilt the business, found a new wife and was very happy.
Sociologists conducted a survey and found that two hours [a week], on average, an adult spends thinking that in life it was necessary to do something different.
That is, two hours a week, we think that we are losers.
If you use at least these two hours to take a step towards a new life, you can achieve amazing results.
For example, the author of the novel "Gone with the Wind" Margaret Mitchell wrote her novel for 10 years.
She just wrote "Gone with the Wind" on some napkins, pieces of paper that she came across.
After 10 years, she had a huge pile of these pieces of paper.
From these pieces of paper they then made this novel, which became a classic.
Abraham Lincoln didn't have the money to go to school.
He was a watchman in a warehouse of goods.
He also studied law in some spurts, and you know the end of this story: he became one of the most famous statesmen.
It was the same with me.
I just decided to spend an hour a day figuring out what I wanted to do.
The rest of the time I was lounging around, just walking, reading books, talking to people.
And after six months of such a pastime, I realized that I like to inspire people, read and write books, I realized that I was good at it.
I did not think how to make money on this, I just started a group "Vkontakte".
Of course, I still thought that the doorbell would somehow be called from the Mikhail Prokhorov Foundation, but this never happened.
I am sure that each of us is a natural resource.
And if you have the talent of a brilliant comedian, but at the same time you are sitting somewhere in the office and making an investment report, then from the point of view of nature you are a bad natural resource, and, most likely, you will not wait for support from the world.
Only by doing what you love — I'm pretty sure of that — can you succeed.
So, in the end, I just led this group on Vkontakte, and one day my doorbell rang, it was again not a courier from the Mikhail Prokhorov Foundation, it was acquaintances of my acquaintances.
They said to me, "Look, you're thin, you've started your own band, you're writing there, you're peeing periodically.
And let's get 15 people together, please tell them how you started doing all this, how you did it."
I say, "Come on," because it was a great chance for me, because 15 people is pretty much the whole world. And we gathered 15 people, and then we gathered again 15 people, and then again 15 people.
And one of those 15 people came up to me and said, "Look, I like what you're saying.
And let's get 150 people together!" I say, "Let's get 150 people together!" And we got 150 people together, we talked to them about change, we talked to them about how to take the first step, how to keep the fire going to a new life.
And then we got 250 people and another 250 people, and then I was invited to TEDx.
I don't know how it works, really!
I don't know how the universe works.
I don't know why that is.
I only know that if you follow the call of your heart, everything will be fine.
I know that a courier will never call our door, will not offer money.
I know that there are no miracles except those that we create ourselves.
And I know that many of you are now on the brink of the very abyss that lies ahead of your real life.
And the only way to not regret at the end of life is to believe and jump.
Take this step.
(Applause)
your own education, regardless of your age.
I'll start with this: When do you think the radius of the earth was first calculated?
When approximately?
When what events?
The Middle Ages, 1840, thousand 2 years ago.
A very strong audience, usually the first version, of course, when Gagarin flew into space.
Mind you, there's reasonableness in this version, why?
There is an impression that if I look at something from the outside, then I can explore it.
So, of course, when Gagarin flew, we were finally able to see our Earth from the outside.
This, of course, is not true, otherwise he would not have flown.
Then there was the 18th century, the 17th, it is not clear what they are attached to.
Usually associated with round-the-world travels of the 15th century - also logical.
What do we think?
If you go around something from all sides, touch it from all sides, you can find out, and this is logical.
That is, we want to explore something, twist it from all sides, look at it, go around it.
But, it turns out, this was done much earlier, by a certain Eratosthenes of Cyrene, in the third century BC.
That is, he, not that he did not fly into space.
Here's what his map looked like: What do we see?
That's all he knew about the Earth.
I will convey to him your applause, he deserves it.
Look: the Mediterranean Sea, a little bit of Europe, Asia quite a bit, Africa fragments, Australia is resting, there is no America at all.
And look, a little man sits for himself, he does not know much about the world, but somehow he takes, thinks and calculates the radius of the Earth so accurately ... Now, of course, we know more precisely, but for that time it is generally incredible, the third century BC!
The key mystery is that someone can, he can, and most of us can't.
That, in my opinion, is the challenge.
What is it related to?
Notice that when we are engaged in education, mostly in school, in university, we study someone: here were smart uncles, they did something, and we study them.
This means that we can only be second, we have no chance of being first because we study them, we are always second.
This is a very sad thesis, if we get an education the way we get it, we are guaranteed to be second.
I hope some of you want to try and practice yourself first.
What is the principal thesis?
To try to be the first, like Eratosthenes of Cyrene, you need to act where no one inherited, where there were no clever uncles yet, otherwise you are just second again, you run after them.
I want to talk about the group of projects "Educational Extreme", I have been doing this for about 20 years.
The most active points now: Krasnoyarsk, Tomsk, Novosibirsk, Moscow.
I'm going to talk about just one line, generally speaking, there are a lot of projects.
The key thesis is as follows: education will take place only when you go to the limit of your capabilities, and sometimes even to the boundary of the possibilities of this cultural sphere that you are engaged in.
That's education, and everything else is called chasing someone.
So, if we work with our world, somehow explore it, train our convolutions, then, unfortunately, too much has been inherited in it.
Eratosthenes of Cyrene has already done, and now you can read, by the way, I recommend reading how he did it, even carefully sorting it out.
Google has it.
But even just after reading what is written there, to imagine how it was done in detail - it will not seem enough, I highly recommend.
It is necessary to act not with those worlds that have already been traced by clever uncles.
We need to train, we need to build problems about possible worlds, these are the so-called Noogen problems.
I want to show a few examples and show you how to train myself on them.
So, the task: to build a flat world in the surface of the cube.
I took the cube from my friend in the morning, I mean, she has a small child.
So, imagine a cube. It's not someone walking on it, it's not interesting, you live in its surface.
Imagine yourself as a scientist of this world, there are many things in the world, maybe there are natural objects, trees, maybe grow, some creatures: smart, brainless, different, and you are such an intelligent scientist.
Now look, it is very important: the scientist is small, and the world is huge.
Just imagine, the radius of the Earth, as calculated by our famous ancestor, 6400 approximately, total width, diameter closer to 13 thousand.
How many times is our planet larger than a tall man?
I hear the right numbers: many million, 6-7 million.
It is fundamental that the little man is very small, the world is huge, he cannot quickly run away, look around the corner, how to look at the house, no, the world is huge.
You're a scientist, you live in it.
Can you learn to measure distance?
You're not looking from above, you're crawling inside, can you introduce time, landmarks.
Here we have someone, again, once thought of the east, the west; we still use it.
How did he figure it out?
Try, enter.
Let's go, how are we going to navigate there?
It's very difficult, because when we studied all this in school, it seemed so elementary to us that it does not even occur to us.
More complex questions: Can this scientist know that the world has a cubic shape?
At the same time, once again, he can't run off to look.
There may be gravity there, he does not leave here at all, like Eratosthenes of Cyrene - he did not fly anywhere, did not even swim.
Can he do it?
Can he build a map?
And, look, the map is not visible from here, but, you are flat so inside, and how do you see the world?
In segments, one-dimensional, and so the map you can build is most likely one-dimensional too.
How can it be built?
When you begin to solve this problem, all everyday thinking comes out, you will learn a lot about yourself if you decide.
What do I mean by everyday thinking?
Do you know that anecdote?
- Dad, which is closer, the Moon or Zhytomyr?
- Well, Shoma, what's the big deal here?
Go to the window, do you see the moon?
-See.
- And Zhytomyr?
This is everyday thinking: what I see is true.
A professional thinks differently.
Very rarely now, in these very difficult times, is the truth clear.
I see the moon, I don't see Zhytomyr, but Zhytomyr is closer, this is a very strange fact.
So, try to build a map.
Do we kind of know what a map is?
I think everybody is sitting there right now and thinking, "Ha, five minutes to work."
You'll see, if you build a map, that there are no key requirements for the map: no scale grid, no landmark system.
We do a polygon, immediately give this map to a traveler, and say, "Go through."
The traveler dies after five minutes, because, as a rule, the map is not tied to the terrain.
And it turns out: what we study in school, it seems to be understandable, but at the same time, as soon as you transfer knowledge to this world, it turns out that we do not understand anything.
By the way, to the word "map".
Now in many areas of activity this word arises: a map of business processes of the enterprise, a map of competence, a map of resources, now a lot of such words arise.
Have you tried to check: is there a map or a list?
Is this a map of business processes or, excuse me, a diagram or a picture?
The map is the greatest tool of mankind, and most of our so-called "maps" do not catch up with these cards.
As a rule, we have lists.
Do someday, it's very interesting.
We are now very spoiled by the fact that we can fly and look from above, it turns off thinking.
We think that the "map" is when you look from above like this, the brains rest and send hello.
Eratosthenes of Cyrene, not being able to see from above, not being able to turn the corner, was able.
Therefore, it is on such simple toys that you can train the ability to discover something that is incredibly greater than you, you are included inside, and, it would seem, you can not see anything, but you can.
For humanitarians.
You understand that fairy tales and legends are also special here.
We solve the problem in groups: small children, big children and even adults.
The most interesting, of course, is to decide the composition from 7 years to 60.
Most of the restrictions are related to sixty rather than seven.
Here's what Arthur says, this is that grown man, solving a similar problem: "When you finish school, university and start working, the variety of your tasks is incredibly narrowed.
Yes, you are cool, you solve these problems very well, but there are so many of them.
And so when you see a task like this, you just find out that you've long forgotten how to do it, or maybe you never knew how."
Therefore, it does not matter at all what age, it will not seem enough.
In a flash, everyday thinking comes out, we find out whether we see the Moon or Zhytomyr.
And an adult, as he claims, again, a successful businessman, in general, sometimes needs to move these grounds, to which you have long been accustomed.
I'll give you some more examples of tasks.
For psychologists, sociologists, fans of the theory of generations, about the digital generation; very interesting task.
We trained on ourselves, tested, assembled three generations, checked: could the next generation be twice as smart as us?
We found out: not yet, we still have ten years, but no more, it seems.
The task is quite adult, solving this problem, you can go to the lecture of Alexander Auzan on economics.
As a rule, property is additive, that is, it consists of pieces.
What does that mean?
If I have 100 rubles, then if I give you 5 rubles, then I will have less, and therefore I will not give.
And while the property is like this, it is very difficult for us to transfer: "I will not give a penny to your tower, I will have less."
But there is information and knowledge that relates not to additive property, but it is often disposed of as additive property.
I'll stop at this point, ask if it's very interesting to solve this.
Now look, gentlemen professionals, as far as I understand, there are no schoolchildren in the hall, there are people working here.
Eat.
Schoolchildren, we have already talked about you.
So, working: you work for someone, you do something; in every field of activity there is a basis.
How can you deeply understand these foundations, and even better, for example, expand, overturn, make innovative.
If you mess around, again, with what's already created, you'll be second.
Maybe catch up someday.
If you formulate such tasks in the field of activity, and solve it with a fun company, you will get a lot of really innovative moves.
Because such tasks force you to work with the basis of concepts.
Not superficially: tie the bow, rename, but with the bases.
Such a tough thesis.
Every professional should once a year solve such problems in his field of activity, then his brains, as they say, are pumped.
We have recently solved the problem of personnel management with representatives of small businesses.
Normally, some moves quickly open up that do not come to mind, if you just sit and think about personnel management.
A few recommendations before you go to gather companies.
As soon as you start doing this, you immediately want to read books.
I hope you will read about Eratosthenes of Cyrene.
There is such a good game "Catch up with the ancestor", it is interesting to dig up directly how someone in your field first did it, why is it suddenly?
Everyone was looking out the window, and no one was bothered: the Sun is small, the Earth is big, why did Copernicus even strain?
You can see.
Look out the window: The sun is small, the earth is big.
The sun is walking, the earth is standing.
Why did Copernicus strain?
What didn't suit him?
Everyone was fine.
By the way, read the objections he received, they are very funny.
At this point, a very good interest begins in our ancestors, who did something there in your field.
If we just read about them, we don't crawl into the depths, and when we do, we dig to the very depths.
Next, it's very important to have mirrors, what does that mean?
When we study at school, we have teachers, their task is to make us a mirror: "well done there, double or not."
And when we become adults, we have as such a mirror the boss, who also says: "Well done or not."
But if our boss is the only mirror, it means that we have no chance of being cooler than the boss.
And moreover, there is no chance to come up with something that the boss does not know about.
That is, you are obviously not just the second, but the 25th.
We really need other mirrors.
One of our projects is "Season of Mathematical Games": teenagers play mathematical games, and then go and spend with preschoolers.
It is we who work with the Tomsk School of Eureka Development and the Tomsk Montessori Kindergarten.
So, a teenager, 5th grade, went down, played a math game for preschoolers, comes back to school the next day and says in class, so tense: "You know what," he tells the teacher, "I was in kindergarten yesterday and saw that these shkets count well, and they do not have math lessons, I found out, and I have been studying mathematics for 5 years.
What did I spend those five years on?
I'm guessing I think it's better than them.
If the numbers were big, the numbers were big, I'd be faster, but spending five years on that is stupid."
Look, where did the guy get that question from?
I studied for myself, I studied.
Because he saw a mirror, he went to these shkets, which didn't even have math lessons, and found out that they were nothing. So to see real mirrors and figure out what you're learning like this guy, "I've been in this field for five years now, and I can do it now."
Try, call to the company of juniors, seniors, your own, strangers, those who have read, those who have not read.
You will learn much more about yourself, about your brains, and about the area with which you want to experiment.
Well, about the general atmosphere.
It should be done without fanaticism, it's fun.
In these tasks, we often give the task to play a scene, to conduct a polygon.
For example, here is the problem about a generation that is twice as reasonable as another generation.
We asked each group to develop its own idea of reasonableness, then figure out how to measure it, and then conduct an experiment on another group.
By chance, I had a group of little girls of 8-9 years old, 18-year-old elephants came to us by lot - Olympians, guys, well, and we have to check them.
My girls did not hesitate to say: "Boys, we will now check your brains, we understand by brains this..".
It turned out that, from their point of view, the guys are very bad.
To which the guys, looking very strongly like this, said: is it okay that we are Olympians?
We're actually very cool."
And the girl calmly says to them: "Well, you know, do you really think that when you solve olympiad problems, are you very smart?" The guy started, he went around for a week and thought: "But really, I'm an Olympian, is this enough or somehow still swing?" In the sense of brains.
If it's fun to do, you kind of shake yourself up, the bows kind of untie.
We looked here, we looked here.
Therefore, the company needs to be more fun, and you can make scenes, you can make films about the worlds that you build, you can make polygons, you can have fun on yourself, it's very interesting.
Total.
Train your own thinking in order to try to be the first in the field in which you work.
To do this, in my opinion, you need to try yourself in those worlds in which you have not yet inherited.
Take your field of activity, highlight the grounds, formulate such a paradoxical task and solve it with a cheerful company, without fanaticism, cheerfully.
And, as Baron Munchausen says, "A thinking person is simply obliged to pull himself by the hair from time to time."
I wish you success.
