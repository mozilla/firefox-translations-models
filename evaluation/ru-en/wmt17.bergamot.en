28-year-old cook found dead in San Francisco shopping center
The 28-year-old, who recently moved to San Francisco, was found dead in the stairs of the local shopping center this week.
However, the victim’s brother says that he can’t imagine someone who would like to hurt him, noting: “Finally, he was doing good.”
“The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia,” San Francisco’s Bureau of Forensic Examination Reported.
The San Francisco Police Department says that the death was classified as murder and investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother, Luis Galicia, told the KGO channel ABC in San Francisco that Frank, the former divorce chef in Boston, got his dream job as a cook at the San Francisco’s Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesperson for Sons & Daughters said they were “shocked and depressed” by his death.
“We are a small team that works as a friendly family and will be very missed,” the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult period.
Luis Galicia said that Frank first stayed in the hostels, but recently, "Finally, he's been doing business."
“He found the apartment, he was dating a girl,” Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn’t imagine anyone who would like to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of contacting his family has always been to make us some dish, prepare us dinner,” Luis Galicia said.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who sailed with the flow.
“With all the bad things that happens to this world, it was the uncut diamond that shone brightly every day,” he said.

Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international group of biologists has come to the conclusion that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the lens of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, whose length exceeds five meters, can be from 272 to 512 years.
Biologists believe that a low metabolism plays an important role in the longevity of the shark, which leads to slow development.
Female Greenland sharks reach sexual maturity only by the age of 150.
Previously, it was believed that the longest possible vertebrate animals live the "neighbor" of the shark - the Greenland whale.
The oldest individual, known to scientists, was slightly older than 210 years.

Should I go to a sanatorium if there are no health problems?
Our expert is the chief doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
And if a person is healthy, just tired of work, should he go to a sanatorium?
Sanatorium-resort rest is necessary for us not only for treatment, but also for the prevention of diseases.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and get the doctor’s recommendations on how to live to make his health not destroyed.
Such recommendations will not be superfluous to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal of the body, you should not brush off it.
Constant stress, mental and physical fatigue can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of visitors experience stress.
And it is most susceptible to people from large cities aged 45 to 55 years.
So it is better not to complicate the situation and give yourself a break in time.
Studies show that 98% of people reduce their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable stay for the whole family.
So, if you want to spend a vacation with your children, you don’t have to break up with them.
For children, even the youngest, there are health programs, which include both diagnostic services, consultations of a pediatrician, tests, and therapeutic.
For example, swimming (in many sanatoriums there are children's pools), inhalations, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, physical therapy.
The course of procedures is determined by the doctor, taking into account the individual readings and features of the growing body.
In addition, in sanatoriums, as a rule, there is a children's club with animators, where children can attend play classes, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even for guests with infants, provide infants with the necessary conditions and provide experienced nanny services.
Soft winter, a long summer, an abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineralnye Vody.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So do not be afraid of the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are held indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, sanatorium-resort treatment is desirable to be carried out 2 times a year, especially for people of adulthood.
The main feature of the region of the Caucasian Mineral Waters, of course, are therapeutic mineral springs: Slavyanovsky, Smirnovsky, Essentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect various body systems.
Water varies in temperature, number of salts, general mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water depending on the patient's well-being.
So, "Narzan" has an anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effect, restores the functions of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
"Essentuki-4" affects the gastrointestinal tract, reduces the level of sugar.
"Essentuki new" has an anti-inflammatory, choleretic and diuretic effect.
The same effects have water "Slavyanskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor necessarily takes into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, it selects less salt water, because the salts retain the liquid, which leads to an increase in pressure.
Reception of mineral water requires compliance with the regime: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and specific temperature.
Now in the sanatoriums there are also various cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What types of recovery, based on the natural features of the North Caucasus, can be obtained at the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, or lard of which is useful for joints, spine, internal organs.
It has an anti-inflammatory, resorbing, immunomodulatory effect.
These are well-thering trips along individually composed routes.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is in close proximity to the mineral source "Narzan".
There you can also take wine, pearl, iodilium, selenium, sage-claky, depending on what the doctor will prescribe you.
Extend the fruiting.
What to do to make the harvest go until the end of the season?
Says Julia Belopukhova, agronomist and summer cottage.
It is time for high-grown tomatoes to arrange a haircut: remove new stepsons, cut the tops, remove all leaves to the penultimate brush with fruits and inflorescences with small ovaries will not have time to ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peres and eggplant, feed the ash-superfospital hood, we treat with biologics (the matter - to accelerate the pouring and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamayor, Bactofyte - from diseases, Immunostyothyth - to increase immunity, Bits).
From chemical products at the end of summer it is worth using only copper sulfate, colloidal sulfur and green soap.
We make the last watering of plants.
Long-distered cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the specimens so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lay on the ground, water with warm water and a solution of Zirkin, sprinkle the stem of 5-7 cm compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruiting of zucchini: cut off the old leaves, spill with warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, pour the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the night cold, install over the bed arc with cover material.
Keep the plants open during the day, and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What does Russia mean out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia’s exit from the longest recession in twenty years.
According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, the GDP of the Russian Federation demonstrates a positive dynamics - in the second quarter, GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This figure has been the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data of Rosstat, the decline of the Russian economy in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The stabilization of the situation was recently also stated by the Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development.
There is slow growth ahead.
According to CBR experts, the recession in the Russian economy has remained in the past.
“The index estimate of Russian GDP suggests that the recession is left behind, and ahead – slow economic growth”, – stated in the bulletin of the Bank of Russia “What trends say”.
Modular GDP estimates for the current quarter of the regulator increased to 0.4%, the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally cleared decline in GDP was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15, ”the representative of the Ministry of Economic Regas told Novosti.
The slowdown in the downturn of the Russian economy over the past five quarters indicates that “the bottom has been passed.”
Among other markers indicating signs of a revival of the national economy, Bloomberg calls the growth of demand for electricity and rail transportation, the revival of business.
If we make an adjustment that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics in plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to an additional working day.
Add to this a lower average annual temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight traffic, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data, and plus or minus 0.5% of the semi-annual volume can also be explained by seasonality, ”explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization of the Russian economy.
For example, a decrease in price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks Rosstat fixes deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble exchange rate, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August since the beginning of the year strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy,” Yakovenko said.
In addition, since April in Russia there has been an increase in industrial production.
In June, the figure increased by 1.7%.
The rate of decline in foreign trade turnover from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May is slowing.
The situation in the labor market also demonstrates positive dynamics, where the unemployment rate decreased to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the favorable situation in the labor market, the question of real disposable incomes of the population to leave much to be desired.
In annual terms, the figure decreases by 4.8%.
This factor can slow down the economic recovery, as household spending makes a significant contribution to GDP.
As a rule, in the structure of the economy, their share exceeds 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia’s tough policy can also be cited as risk factors for economic growth.
The regulator keeps the rate at 10.5%, which does not have the best effect on the real sector.
The insufficient level of investment is a negative factor, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the pace of the fall of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015, ”says Irina Rogova, an analyst at Forex Club.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly took root in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, is not so actively developed in summer sports.
If in the Olympic Games in Rio for Russia and former foreigners perform, in most cases we are talking about the natives of the countries - the former republics of the Soviet Union.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can observe the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians act under the flags of other states.
In each case, the history of the change of citizenship is different.
Someone's parents took to another country as a child, leaving no choice.
Someone could not stand the competition for a place in the Russian national team.
And someone considered that abroad will create the best conditions for development in sports.
"AiF.ru" found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
In the German passport of a 27-year-old girl it is written that her name is Lisa Redhich.
But before, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa’s parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in the footsteps of her older sister - to engage in athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose pole vault.
She will remain in Russia, it would hardly be able to "move from the throne" Elena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Olympics in Rio Lisa will be our only countrywoman, albeit former, in the sector for pole vaulting.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze of the 2010 European Championship and the silver of the continental championship in 2016, which she won again in the absence of Helena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirozhkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are religious propagandists of the evangelical direction.
Mostly because of their faith, they left for the United States when the girl was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight more children grew up in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield in Massachusetts.
Lena began to be fond of fighting in school.
Showing good results, she moved to the city of Colorado Springs, where at the US Training Center of the US struggle continued classes under the leadership of another former Russian Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 Olympics in London, Elena lost in her first fight.
But at the World Cup in the same year - a victory.
Before that, by the way, she managed to win silver at the 2010 world championship.
After that, there was bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in the city of Yaroslavl, where she first met synchronized swimming.
But to say that it was brought up by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl’s family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There Maria continued her classes.
Soon she was already part of the US national team and showed excellent results at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, it can not compete with Russian synchronizers, but for America its indicators are the ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Kristina Shaldibina received at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue teaching the girl rhythmic gymnastics overseas.
Until this point, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
Having emigrated to the United States, she quickly entered the youth team of this country, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
For the first positions on the world stage, she, of course, did not have to fight, but for the United States she organized a real breakthrough - she brought the star-striped team to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
Another of our former "artist" - Jan Berezko-Marggnerder, who plays for the German national team.
Yana was born in Togliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13 years old, the family decided to move to Germany - there the girl had more prospects to get into the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, however, Yana was able to take only 17 place, insufficient to get into the final competitions in the personal championship.
But two years before that, she managed to win the bronze medal of the Olympic Games - youth.
Another gymnast, only this time sports - Irina Sazonov.
If the ways of emigrating the previously mentioned athletes can be called standard, then the choice of the Irina family is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a pupil of the Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the champion of the country.
However, Ira is still training in Russia - specially comes to his homeland, so as not to lose skill.
In Rio, she did not perform as well as she would like.
The best place is 40 in the personal all-around.
Information about the swimmer Maria Ugolkova in the Russian information space is extremely small.
For a very long time Maria lives and trains in Switzerland.
However, for a long time, she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a country record at a distance of 200 meters butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began to act under a red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance is 14th place in the 4×100 comprehensive relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to collect about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for preparations for the Olympics.
31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov almost his entire career has spent under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Khasavyurt managed to become a three-time prize-winner of the European championships, the champion of Russia, a master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped getting into our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from sports.
The triumphant return took place at the Asian Championships in 2016 - Batirov already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Olympics in Rio.
About another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, at home is even less known than even about the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkova.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand, when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to engage in gymnastics.
He has not achieved great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40 place in qualifying on parallel bars.
But for New Zealand, even getting to the Olympic Games in gymnastics is already a breakthrough.
When Nastya, born in Moscow in 1985, was only 9 years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming classes, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, the girl took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In the duet with Evgenia Tetelbaum Anastasia took eighth place.
In the solo program, she was the fifth.
As well as Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter plays for the national team of Israel.
When the boy was only 6 years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry has already become the champion of the country.
In the same year he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croutter won the gold of the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry is engaged in long jumps and triple jumping.
31-year-old Albert is another native of Khasavyurt, who, after long performances for Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batrov, Albert chose Romania, which will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Skills of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 even becoming the champion of the country.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of a player of the USSR national volleyball team Yaroslav Antonov.
Literally a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player of the planet.
Soon he decided to continue his career in Italy.
There the family remained for permanent residence.
In 2015, as part of the national team, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship, held on the territory of his new homeland.
Khadzhiev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and got with his family in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - it was necessary to go to France, to Nice.
There Zelimkhan continued to learn freestyle wrestling.
Soon he won the world championship among juniors, and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only representative of France in the wrestling tournament.
And again a freestyle wrestling, and again a former Russian.
This time we will talk about a native of North Ossetia, who emigrated to Spain - Taimuraz Frive.
At the end of December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and he is currently playing for the national team of this country.
Prior to that, however, the 30-year-old athlete managed to be noted with high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the championships of the country in 2007 and 2008.
Tired of failure to get into the national team, Taimuraz decided to change sports citizenship.
The last in our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, - Artur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took their family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur, on the advice of his older brother, began to box.
Since then, Arthur has become the champion of Canada three times, and in 2012 became the world champion among youth.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the gold of the Pan American Games, the first for his new homeland since 1975.

Why do children need Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratiev, "Cossads need to be brought up not by stocks and parades, but systematically."
They should grow and from at least 7 years understand that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But while this work, it seems to me, is being carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes will absorb all the positive ones that have been accumulated earlier, at a qualitatively new level, I will be glad.
If all in linger and unnoticed as, the new idea will turn into cheap populism.
Housing and communal services continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
There are attacks on funds allocated for the needs of the communal sphere from the budgets of different levels.
According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, overpriced tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing and communal services sector.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid more than 170 million rubles to the energy sector.
Recently, the prosecutor's office of the Krasnodar Territory revealed the facts of inclusion in tariffs of unreasonable costs.
And in the expenses of LLC "IV-consulting" (suggests cold water) were laid 4 million rubles. for renting cars at a price higher than the market.
And such examples in the country are a lot.
The people give the last money for the "communal" and pays properly - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged under several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of proceeds of crime, abuse of authority, etc. d.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, which was engaged in the repair of urban facilities, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, work on them was not actually performed, but paid.
Businessmen just returned him most of the money.
And as the owner of the Criminal Code, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay service providers and spent it on his own needs.
As a result, the damage to the budget and tenants - millions of rubles.
The scheme of Makarov’s machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
A whole wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the Criminal Code, who appropriated citizens’ money, took place around the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A continues. Cohan, by the way, is also a former deputy of the city council, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013. in Elizovo, Kamchatka Territory, he established 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the Criminal Code, two others played the role of settlement and cash centers, that is, they took money from the population.
However, the energy A. Kohan did not transfer funds, but spent on himself, beloved.
Judging in the housing sector is quite difficult.
Things are not initiated, they are delayed.
And "helps" in this extremely confusing housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razvorotneva, executive director of NP "Housing and Communal Services Control".
We do not have time to earn one law, as we come up with a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also few specialists, including among judges, on housing and communal services.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law in universities receive very little attention.
Refusal to initiate criminal cases, about red tape during the investigations are also talked about in the Prosecutor General’s Office.
From those in production in 2015. 3.5 thousand Less than half of the crimes were sent to the court.
For the rest, the investigation was protracted and every fifth suspended due to the non-establishment of the accused.
Often, deficiencies in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to them for gaps in the current legislation.
There is a law, but the bodies of inquiry are not in a hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015. there were about 230 reports of forgeries - only 60 criminal cases were initiated.
For 5 months of this year, their number increased only slightly - 99.
What is the falsification of the minutes of the meeting of residents?
This means that the change of management of the house, financial and other issues bypass the opinion of the owners.
And this also means that normal companies that want to work honestly, and not “milk” the population can not break into the housing and communal services market.
It turns out that tenants in the minus, small and medium-sized businesses, too.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such in the whole state, - said Anton Zharkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property.
And now this work is actively underway.
These are not just isolated actions - it is a focused course towards the fight against corruption.
Of course, not in all regions such a sad situation.
In particular, in the capital scandals and does not smell.
Why in Moscow there are no such scandals in the housing and communal services sector as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed iron will and brought order, - said "AiF" Anatoly Elected, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption.
I mean the personnel issue, the legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies have a close supervision, and they all went through licensing.
Complaints of citizens are promptly resolved in the public space (both appeals of residents and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many do not just pay monthly receipts, but closely monitor what is written there, how the house is kept.
Awareness among the population about the rights of owners and obligations of resource-supplying and management organizations is very high.
Plus, Moscow checks the validity of tariffs for housing and communal services - after all, a considerable part of the budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for numerous categories of the population.
Probably, all this together explains the calm situation in Moscow.
So everything rests on the will of the regional authorities?
Maybe the weak-willed should be changed place of work?
The Turkish gambit.
Will Erdogan be able to give up friendship with the EU and the United States?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has put forward an ultimatum to the United States, proposing to make a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup d’état.
He said this, speaking to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan urged the Americans to abandon the support of the “terrorist organization of the Fethullah players”.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States is calling for a change of position.
Experts believe that the split in Turkey’s relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change power in the country.
“Sooner or later, America will make a choice between Turkey and the FEET (Terrorist Organization of the Fethullahists).
Either the fighting phases of the FETO, or democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice,” Erdogan’s Anatolian news agency said on Wednesday evening.
The Turkish president once again, but already more severely demanded from the United States to fulfill its demand, voiced by him for the first time immediately after the suppression of the rebellion.
Recall that on the night of July 16, in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an appeal to the population, the rebellion was suppressed, and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In total, about 8 thousand people fell under suspicion, in the ranks of which, in addition to the military, were teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Also, supporters of Erdogan admitted that the Americans could be involved in the coup d’état.
The United States denied all claims in its address, refusing to extradite Gulen and advising to change the tone.
The latest statement of representatives of the state Department on this matter was made at the time of Erdogan’s visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
However, this does not stop the President of Turkey - he stubbornly insists on his own and also puts forward demands for his other Western partners.
“Ankara will cease to fulfill its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union, if Brussels does not name the date of abolition of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens,” Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omer Çelik said on August 9.
According to him, Ankara’s introduction of amendments to the anti-terrorist law, as required by the EU, will jeopardize Europe’s own security.
On August 1, German Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open borders for migrants in order to achieve visa facilitation with the EU.
His words were a response to the corresponding statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Cavusoglu made another provocative statement on Wednesday, assuming that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry did not rule out that the country will consider the possibility of withdrawing from the alliance if it does not meet the expected support from it.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sector is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sector, - they import missiles," Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
According to him, Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its own technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
“So far, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not been satisfied with us, and we have begun to look for others,” he said.
Experts believe that all this speaks about Turkey’s serious disagreements with the West and the country’s reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Expertise, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Tayyip Erdogan is now playing his game and cannot go for a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot tied to the West both in terms of business and from the point of view of the military (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance while maintaining the framework relations with the West.
Although, of course, it would be more convenient for Americans to see a completely obedient person in this post, ”the expert explained to AiF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (on the non-payment of EU compensation, the requirement of visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gulen from the United States) will be pressured.
“Recep Tayyip Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will put pressure on him on humanitarian issues, for dictatorial methods of governing the country and so on,” Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Alexei Mukhin, admits that the Turkish president will change his point of view in relations with Russia as soon as it becomes profitable for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan took an extremely tough stance against Russia and was looking for favors in the West by all means.
In an extremely short time, the situation has changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that after a while the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think that Erdogan has entered a period of shuttle diplomacy.
Once between the two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself," Mukhin said.
In his opinion, the main task for the President of Turkey today is to keep the political power in the country, and for this he just needs Russia and partnership relations with Vladimir Putin, so that the United States stops supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the United States, which with the help of it control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached,” the expert believes.
A different point of view is held by the head of the Center for Asia and the Middle East Anna Glazova.
Now relations between Turkey and the EU, and with the United States are quite tense, and this is primarily due to domestic policy, which is personally pursued by Erdogan.
I think that this crisis in relations will be exacerbated, and against this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to reset the policy in both the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no coincidence that the president of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, say that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel have been resolved, and active political interaction with Iran is underway, ”Glaszova explained to AiF.ru, admitting that the next step of Erdogan will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
According to her, the policy that Erdogan is now pursuing is a return to the course of the foreign policy concept, which was followed by Turkey before the beginning of the Arab revolutions.
“It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively in the positions of “zero problems with its neighbors”.
Now there were very successful visits of the President of Turkey to Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this vector of foreign policy will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey’s position both in the regional and international arenas,” the expert believes.
Glazova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relations with the EU, now the question is whether the EU will begin to respond harshly to Turkey, which can go to open the borders for migrants and thereby create serious problems for Europe.
Strike of Junior Doctors: Calls for New Collective Protests
Representatives of junior doctors appealed to the trade union with a request to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new employment contract.
The Committee of Junior Doctors (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask for its full advice to support more collective protests since the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students in July voted for the cancellation of the transaction under an employment contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said the government continued to “streetly” about the problems she said led to the derogation of the employment contract.
She said: “Given the current situation, the head of JDC voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiations on all your issues.”
In response to the government’s silence, JDC’s chief today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to endorse a continuous program to expand collective protests, starting early September.
The dispute has led young doctors to take part in six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of BMA’s younger doctors, Dr. Joan Malawan, resigned after voting for the cancellation of the agreed terms of the employment contract, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members that the deal was good, which should be taken during meetings on the eve of the vote of 54 000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the employment contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "The Bad Alliance"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin welcomed his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had a steady impression that Ankara wanted more about this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin’s smile looked stretched, and he hardly radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, as opposed to this, has repeatedly spoken about his “dear friend” Mr. Putin – five times, according to one report.
I lost my account.
He also promised that relations with Russia will return not only to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, one newspaper described Mr. Erdogan’s actions as if nothing had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the protracted coolness emanating from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening comments: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction at that moment was frantic.
Mr. Putin erupted with an angry tirade, blaming Ankara of Moscow’s stab in the back.
The insult was even stronger, based on an alleged friend.
Restoring real trust will be difficult, probably impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media conducted a staggering, total offensive against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be considered guilty of everything.
The most serious were accusations from top officials that Mr. Erdogan’s own family has profited from the illegal oil trade from the Syrian zones controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But in St. Petersburg, there was an official signal that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting occurred only because Mr. Putin received an apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory of its kind.
For Ankara, the advantages of a truce ads are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was almost overthrown from his post last month in an attempted coup.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There is also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard — a particularly ban on charter flights, which typically bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number fell sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here, of course, will feel relief when flights finally resume.
They put at the peak of the end of the season on the Mediterranean Sea.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish imports of agricultural products were allowed again.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as the report in the Vedomosti newspaper said.
But the visit also had additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for seeing a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this its protracted dissatisfaction with the turtle tempo of talking about joining the EU and Mr. Putin’s step – who seeks to take advantage of the coolness and gradually destroying Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for the call for support for elected authorities after the attempted coup.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted fear of regime change.
So, the summit in this brilliant palace on the sea coast allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as a “bad Alliance”: two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
However, despite the public display of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposite sides.
Perhaps he says for itself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they did not even touch on the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin chose to focus on them.
There is no clear agreement on how they can find a common language on Syria.
But after months of open hostility — and taking into account the possibility of a total catastrophe, when a NATO member Turkey has shot down a Russian jet fighter — it is better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to End Customers Outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to the role of the back office, according to the bank’s executive director.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McAvan told the BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was associated with the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has stepped down from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and had to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer lending brands.
It was supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship of international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for banking services of individuals who will get more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during a tour of clients and employees in Invernessshire.
He told the BBC Scotland, “The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one where our staff will be busy because we are now becoming more a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I’m saying now that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in its groups of the population, and our staff will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not be to continue its sponsorship support for the Six Nations Cup, and it is building up the profile of different brands in sponsoring the sport.
“Is this the right time for us to move the brand bank, as we focus on improving the bank for customers at the heart of the time, at the heart of the time, how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?” The executive director said.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a wonderful bank for customers and would shut down all these brands.
But with the work we did, focusing on the needs of our customers, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brands again, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Detori reaches 3000 winners with victory in Newmarket on Passions
Dettori sprays champagne after a double in Newmarket leads him to 3000 wins
Jockey Frankie Detori achieved his 3000th British victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this outstanding mark with the help of his second winner of the night on his home path - on the Prediles trained by John Staten Hospital.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this outstanding mark in smooth jumps.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lesauder Piggott, Pat Idderi and Willy Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettore, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: “This is something special.”
I'm very excited because my family is here too
I'm very happy it happened in Newmarket, as it was here that I settled 30 years ago.
It’s not a big social event, it’s not Royal Ascot – it’s a normal Friday night with 20000 people.
I am free from business and very unpretentious.
Dettoter accepts applause when it leads Predisposition after victory
Two jockeys reached such a mark in the races with obstacles: the champion of the jock Richard Johnson and the retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4300 wins in a record career.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Franks is one of the best jockeys of the modern era and it is not surprising that he reached this mark, which so few reached before him.
It is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical ingenuity that distinguishes it from others in the spring room.
He is a great representative for the races, his enthusiasm and charisma attracted fans to this sport for years.
I told Franki a few weeks ago in Eps, he would have brought 6000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend and big races!
And seriously, Frankie brought the winners in the UK for most of the 30 years, which is great to see.
He is an energetic character, which is good for the British race, but moreover, he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Detatore celebrated this outstanding mark of a branded fast jump from a horse
From fast-paced finishes to fast jumps, Frankie Dettorita has been a symbol of British smooth jumps for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many winners of the big races, including his famous Magnificent Seven in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived the plane crash and was in disqualification due to doping.
Three years ago, he first faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while – Dettory previously said that he would like to continue to participate in competitions, at least until the age of 50.
Putin dismisses the head of the administration Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly fired his head of the administration Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s trusted inner circle for many years.
This 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for environmental and transport.
The statement from the Kremlin says that Putin “decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration,” but did not name the reason.
Mr. Ivanov’s deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the capital of Estonia, Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he was the head of the protocol department of the president and the government apparatus, the Kremlin website (in Russian).
During his appointment, he told Putin, “Thank you for your trust.”
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as head of state in terms of draft laws and control of how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to be released from office and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Do the smiles say?
This is the move that puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest supporters of Vladimir Putin and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As the head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles on camera, it was not convinced of anyone here – especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that the man who was once campaigned for as a potential president suddenly wanted to govern Russian environmental policy was met with tremendous skepticism.
In Putin’s remarks quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: “It is true that in early 2012 I asked you to entrust you with this very difficult position in an interview, even, one might say, a troubled position, for four years.
Well, I was the head of the presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB State Security Service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990’s, when Putin was the head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most of the most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could have become president of Russia after Putin’s second term, as a third term would be contrary to Putin’s constitution.
However, this post was taken by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister until he returned to the presidency after only three and a half years.
The star of the series “To Think like a criminal” Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with the producer
Gibson was a participant in the brawl on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce series, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before it was announced his removal.
There were creative differences on the set and divergence of opinions.
I’m sorry it happened,” he said in a statement.
Detailed information on how Gibson’s character will be removed from the show that monitors the FBI agent’s team is expected to arrive later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in Darma and Greg’s sitcom, was on the show since the first season in 2005.
“I love ‘Thinking as a Scrier’ and put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years,” Gibson said in a statement on Friday.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it will be impossible.
I just would like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and most importantly, the best fans that the show could only dream of.
It is planned that the show will return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: fish landed in the garden of Banfa
A man from Banfa sought help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Baine believes that 75 fish could have been gerbils left by water tornadoes.
Bayn, who lives 500 meters from the sea, posted a shooting of this spectacle in Periscope in the hope that someone will be able to shed light on the appearance of two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Feet
Project of 1.35 billion pounds now to be completed by May 2017
Engineers connected the northern span and the Queensferre Crossing Viaducts – which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four clamping between the “voils of the canvas”, which are now coming to an end near all three pylons of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters in length and weighs 30 000 tons.
It has 10 000 tons of steel and 20 000 tons of concrete and 46 cubits of bridge.
The project of 1.35 billion pounds is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown today visited the site and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of Kwinferri Crossing.
We are all witnesses of engineering art of a really epic scale in this project, where more than 30 000 tons of concrete and steel were used only for the construction of this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the clamification between the viaduct and the bridge is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate assembling tolerances.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now on the spot, for the last section of the canvas, the concrete coating is cast in Rosite today, which means that the entire canvas is ready to climb to the site on the bridge.
Michael Martin, director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first clusibility of each bridge project is always a big milestone.
In this stunning project, this clamping is the most modern construction art.
After installing the last section of the roadway and connecting it with the expanding roadway of the North Pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern - or facing the shore - side.
This was done by pulling the viaduct of the northern approach by 700 millimeters to the south.
It was a large and at the same time very elegant operation.
Large-scale, because the Toyota with a length of 222 meters, weighs about 6000 tons and should have been raised by the angle of inclination of about 3%.
Elegant, because the tolerances that the team worked on were tiny - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Luckily, it all went very well.
Salvation in the Bay of Moelfra: The Three Men “lucky to stay alive”
The three men were “lucky to stay alive” after being thrown from a fishing vessel to Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British summer time on Friday, after the team saw the incident unfolding in the Gulf of Moelfra.
Three men struggled to swim to a safe place, while their ship continued to go on its own.
“We saw their ship circled next to them and assumed the worst,” said Vince Jones, the ship’s lifeboat.
“Fortunately, by the time we went down to the water, a strong wind had taken it away from them,” he added.
Two men were rescued with a local fishing vessel, and a third man of 60 years was found exhausted and clung to a buoy without a life jacket.
All of them were raised on board the coastal lifeboat and taken to the rescue station
Jones said, “Three men thrown into the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The engine of the boat had an emergency rocket, but it somehow unhooked off the man who was running the boat when it overturned.
Someone guarded these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a decent hunt for health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at the screens, was a complaint by many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go tears people away from the sofa and involves some physical activity.
The time in the screen was initially limited to TV, then video games and recently smartphones.
It’s so great to see that technology and activity on the street are not mutually exclusive.
I, of course, mean the vociferous hobby, which is Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally created for video games in the 1990’s (subsequently spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards and other offsets).
Like many other pop cultural phenomena, all this has lost its former relevance somewhat earlier than this new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries at that time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as much as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, players with smartphones go look for Pokémon, who are tracked by GPS and, being detected, can be “photographed” (through a screenshot on your phone) or “caught”.
The generation that played the game, being younger, joined the guise, breaking away from the sofas for search.
In the US, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps passed by a “normal” person every day.
The cardiography, an Apple Watch app that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days since the launch of the game, the number of people tracked, who performed 30-minute exercises on a daily basis, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on the passage of levels.
Many health campaigns that convince people to “find 30 minutes”, “stand from the couch” and “to be active every day” have not found a response because most health messages are boring and speak out by people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits, too long to bring here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out into the street to do what they love.
Thus, three foundations of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring boobs who are looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might stumble upon the door.
So what?
The breakthrough has occurred.
After all, despite the fact that smartphone apps such as Fitbit could have previously tracked our physical activity, they did not give us a reason to study, as this game gives.
The novelty is coming, and the use will weaken over time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, in good shape and healthy.

Simone Biles wins the gold of absolute primacy in women's gymnastics
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the turmoil.
Simone Biles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on a support jump.
Relaxed on the log.
Stunning on the floor.
Stunning everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of champion in absolute primacy on Thursday, placing the abyss between themselves and the rest of the world on a convincing demonstration under close Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62.198 was at a sufficient distance from the silver medallist and teammate "Financial Five" Eli Rearsman and the Russian bronze medallist Alija Mustafina.
Biles from the United States performs at the gymnasium log during the final of the women's individual absolute championship in rhythmic gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth consecutive American woman to win the title of champion of absolute championship and the fifth in general, fixing her reputation as the best of her generation and, perhaps, ever.
She burst into it when she showed her final overall score and her long journey was over by this time.
This achievement puts it in the same league as exceptionally rare athletes like Michael Phelps, who have lifted their sports to new heights:
Biles has spent the last three years dominating his sport, winning 15 World Championship medals – including 10 gold – with such stunning programs in their mix of hard work and accuracy that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the greatest gymnast I have ever seen.”
One last test was waiting in Brazil, the competition is not so much between the Biles and the rest in this area, but between it and the burden of inflated expectations.
Any less than going back to his family's home to Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered as an unjustified wait.
Simone Biles from the United States, on the left, and Elie Reisman hug after winning gold and silver, respectively, in the final of the women's individual absolute rhythmic gymnastics championship at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Biles earned the first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of the outgoing party of the resigning coordinator of the national team Martha Caroli.
While Biles insisted that she never looked into the future during her long journey to the top, it is not entirely.
Part of her free exercise program – the one that includes her signature passage – is set for Latin American music that would fit right at home on the street outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandfather and grandmother, being a beginit to walk a child and openly by the mother of coach Aimee Burman during a visit to the hall where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She has not lost a single competition in absolute primacy since the summer of 2013 - a band of luck, which should continue for as long as Biles will want.
Despite the fact that Mustafina gained a slight advantage with the help of two rotations, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic logs and free exercises – where Biles defends the title of world champion – are ambushed.
She again came forward from 15,433 on the log and ended with 15,933 on the floor.
Raism gently hugged her while they were waiting for the final score – a pure formality – and tears appeared around shiny red with white and blue eyeliner Byls, when the idea she once recorded in the album for clippings took place.
Raysman’s performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago, when she shared third place, but lost to Mustafina’s bronze on a tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, which the Americans call his “grandmill” was much ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise, covered by a return, which sometimes seemed to be in question.
As for the Byles, the 19-year-old viral tweet from the beginning of this week now has a completely new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in the case of a serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died during the deadliest attack in the case of the first serial killer Phoenix in the last decade, sat in the car, talked and listened to music while they were shot dead, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, was shot on June 12, when their car was parked on the roadway, the authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from a pistol, standing on the passenger side of the car, and then fled to another vehicle, according to the report.
Police say the triple murder is apparently not the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the wallets or $2 900, which were at its disposal of one of the adult victims.
A spokesman for the Phoenix Police, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to check if he was affiliated with the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others were injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Hispanic areas for four months.
“It’s happening in a residential area in front of the house,” Howard told KPHO, a CBS branch earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including the brown Nissan late 1990’s, the black BMW of the late 1990’s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were interconnected and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
The liner, 31, and daughter of Ellis, Malia, died on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual in the fact that they were sitting in a parked car, listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report on the shelling, the purpose of which was an empty pickup for half an hour before the triple murder and which was believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the shell casings and pulled the bullet from the seat and fragments of a bullet from the engine compartment.
The mother of a 6-year-old child with microcephaly: “It gets better”
Like most six-year-old children, Edmund Pixivto loves singing, toys and, of course, her mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund microcephaly is the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Peakivto did not know during pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was I can't do it.
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for that.
What, in fact, is not true – of course you subscribe to it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even offered to put it in a specialized treatment facility.
“My first answer was, ‘I didn’t think people were doing that’,’” Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with walkers.
Edmund did not sit and crawl until he was three, and he still does not speak.
But it slowly goes through some stages.
He walks with outside help and rides a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture Edmund came up with for "please sing to me."
“We are teaching his sign language,” Pixivto told CBS News.
But not just a normal sign language — she says Edmund has invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic, such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
Symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It is too early to talk about how this will affect the lives of those who are infected with the Zika virus.
Pixivo recalls emotional losses because of an uncertain future.
I kept telling me what would happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I haven’t actually asked for a lifetime because I don’t expect anyone to really be able to tell me.
But Pixivto has encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects because of Zika.
It's getting better.
You know that everything will get better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding cause rescue operations in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more precipitation expected to fall over the state before Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in the south-east of Louisiana and the south of the Mississippi have overflow and threaten large-scale flooding after extreme precipitation, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said government officials were in constant contact with local authorities and had already left for the implicated arrivals.
Mike Steele, the representative of the Office of the Governor for National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that there are requests for transport for high water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the arrival of Tanjipahoa requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
The danger of flooding remains in force until Saturday in most of the south of Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 3-5 inches could flood the area.
In southern Alabama, duty in anticipation of the floods operated until Friday, as the rain continued to go in the area of Mobile.
The Komit River near Baton Rouge and the Eimite River near Den. Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a flood record this weekend.
Forecaster Alec Krautmann said both rivers could flood many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding going downstream in the coming Assenshen is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Tickfo River, slightly south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest ever recorded levels at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still pulling out of the floods in Emit and Wilkinson counties in the southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued earlier on Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the Biver Creek waters, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, quickly rose overnight.
He said that the other stepson that lives nearby warned him.
“We woke up and the water continued to advance,” Hansford said.
She's reached my belt level.
His wife told Hansford that this is the biggest influx she saw in 48 years that she lived here.
Hansford said he and all his family members have a disability, and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flood is “raised quickly” as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday night.
Krautmann said the soil had been saturated with rainfall from Wednesday.
Heavy rain and flooding of streets led to work to rescue residents from houses in the parish of Tandipahoa and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, the authorities said.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tanjipahoa’s adviser told about 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they are both flooded.
The chairman of the parish, Robbie Miller, said that the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets in high water.
The shelters were opened in the town of Eimit and Hammond to receive those who were evacuated.
“They will have the opportunity to return home as soon as the water begins to retreat,” he said.
In Hammond, the parish of Tandi Pajo, about two dozen streets were closed due to the high water level, and sandbags were available for extradition to residents in the hope that they would keep the water away from homes and businesses.
“The last major flooding we had was in March,” said city manager Lacey Landloom.
This is on the way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, Head of Emergency Management Rupert Lacey said the rain continued to go on the Gulf Coast.
According to him, several houses were registered as flooded on Thursday, but none were registered on Friday.
Kate Towson, head of Shopper Value Foods in Amit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in places I’ve never seen it before,” said Tauson, “and she still pours to the ground.”
Mahaž Brown, 6, “reduced by bullets” remains alive after a shootout in Philadelphia
Police said Philadelphia was shot at a 6-year-old boy, registering a second shooting at a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child’s grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as the Mahage of Brown.
Grandpa and grandfather say Brown received numerous gunshot wounds, including his groin, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got a lot of money, his small body was riddled by bullets,” says his grandmother Delores Melenez station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in the hospital in critical condition and survived several operations.
The family told the station that it is expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to first grade at a local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people who were shot in the Germantown quarter.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
It is reported that one of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims were registered in a stable state, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police were investigating whether any of the wounded men could be shooting.
Investigators tell CBS Philadelphia that there appears to be a shootout between several armed men.
Shells from semi-automatic weapons, attributed to different copies of semi-automatic weapons, fixed the scene.
It seems that it was definitely a long battle.
There were shell casings on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
Therefore, apparently, there were several armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shootout, ”said Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi.
Many homes and cars in this area were also affected.
No arrests were made and the police were reportedly viewing surveillance cameras.
Another 6-year-old child, the girl, was hit in the hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday when she was playing in front of her home in the West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That’s what I call the women’s Olympic Gymnastics team this year and for several reasons.
First, I’ve been to every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been that dominant.
And second: in this team, three gymnasts play a key role: Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The composition of this team, complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like America.
It also strengthened the black and Latin American women’s presence at the top of this sport.
For the past four years, the number one women's gymnast was African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabbi Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed it.
Now the world could have witnessed the incredible performances of the three-time World Champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, performing unexpected, but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women’s individual absolute championship.
And a colleague in the national team Elie Reisman earned silver.
We are witnessing the peak of this sport, but it does not look like this in gymnastics all over the country.
Simone, Gabbi and Laurie have all chosen the same path as Ali and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They are the “final five” because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts in the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroli’s coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastic clubs that are supported with the help of parents who pay for the cost of training, equipment, travel, form, contributions for participation in competitions, payment of hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list continues.
Most of these gymnastic clubs are located in rich suburban areas that can support this business.
These clubs are located where gymnasts receive everything from their training, and this is an expensive and long-term duty for gymnast families.
Amey Burman, coach Simone Biles, and Maggie Hani, coach Lori Hernandez, both have trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to create a more affordable and affordable gymnastics learning community to county young girls inspired by Simone, Gabbi and Laurie.
I founded my gymnastics fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and inexpensive gymnastics classes located in Harlem, for more than 15 000 young young guys (mostly black and Latinos) and raised national and international champions.
In September, we will expand into Detroit (my hometown) to provide high-quality youth gymnastics that deserves to be taught and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develop strength, flexibility and coordination for the body, as well as resistance to exhausting work, discipline and perseverance to the mind.
This combination has a positive impact throughout life on good health, success in school and work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send thousands of girls to do gymnastics, and this is great.
Playing sports is so important, especially for girls.
This is such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Ali, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of the “Women’s Force” in the win of the Olympic team gold and for motivating so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors took up the announcement of further strikes after the rejection of the proposal of Jeremy Hunt
The ministers hoped to end the change dispute, agreeing on the amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37 000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the treaty, saying that the NHS was on “no land” and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first doctors have been transferred to a new contract, which includes changes in working hours and weekends to improve service during extracurricular hours.
Dr. Helen McCaqué, chairman of the Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: “Joint doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the existing labor crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors fairly.”
There are only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is over.
The WMA’s attempt to resolve the dispute by negotiations was met by the reluctance to take action and sometimes silence on the part of the government.
And this despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
“Jeremi Hunt needs to act now, inspire the introduction and respond to the fears of younger doctors.
If he does not do this, then the younger doctors are unambiguous that they are ready to organize subsequent strikes.
The last strike at the end of April brought the delay of about 13 000 planned operations and 100 000 nursing techniques, while nurses and consultants were involved to ensure the replacement of doctors on the picketing line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes, agreeing on the amended agreement with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
WMA wants a better payment of weekends for 54 000 junior doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer said: “The strikes are getting little or nothing, but put pressure on the teams and services already working at the limit, and cause anxiety, physical pain and disorders to patients, nurses and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Committee of Junior Doctors and, together with the Department of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns regarding the role of guardians and corporate information policies.
Employees hoped that continued positive assistance on other important topics — such as staff distribution, training flexibility, additional training for those returning after a career break, tuition, the cost of learning, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender differences in wages in medicine — were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Health Department were meeting the conditions reached by WMA in November, February and May.
Drug for £2 per day can reduce the threat of a heart attack
Thousands of patients with a heart attack are going to use the drug for £2 per day, after the authorities recommended giving it to more people and for a longer time.
The anti-coagner drug ticaglor reduces the risk of repeated attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The National Health Service of the UK National Health Service advised to give it to people for four years to prevent the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the National Health Service of the National Health Service of the UK has advised people to give it to people for four years to prevent the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack occurs with about 140 000 people in England annually, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat material on the walls of the arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque ruptures on the part, then this can cause a thrombus that blocks blood access to the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the thrombus moves, it will be able to move along the flow of blood and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already overtaken one attack are at greater risk of getting another.
Tikaglelor, produced by the British firm AstraZeneca and sold under the name Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
The NICE draft instruction, published today, recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagell for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Medical Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite having effective secondary prevention techniques with about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack, there is another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of recurrence can have a significant negative impact on a person’s quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagler in combination with aspirin is effective when reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
Preliminarily recommending ticaglorol, we are happy to be able to increase the treatment options available to many thousands of people who are ready to use it.
Since information about the efficacy and safety of ticagellor — especially the risk of bleeding — is limited to three years, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
PC ownership culture allows you to thrive the falsification of vote counting in Muslim areas
Former Mayor of Tower-Hamlets Lutfour Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption, following government report
The culture of political correctness led to the eye cover, which resulted in a widespread falsification of the counting of votes in Muslim communities, according to information from the government’s devastating report released today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles clashes clashes criticizing the police, election observers and the city administration for ignoring evidence of electoral irregularities due to “excessive sensitivity to race and religion.”
The former secretary of the local community, now the anti-corruption tsar, said that intimidation of voters on religious grounds was so strong that the police need to be allowed to put cordons outside the polling stations to protect the frightened voters.
He proposes that voters take identity cards to prove who they are when they vote.
At the moment, voters must only indicate their name and address.
The report even offers to put indelible ink on people’s fingers when they hand over their ballots, in order to exclude that someone can vote twice.
It is necessary to provide better protection to whistleblowers, said Sir Eric.
It calls on the press to give the press greater access to the documents of the local council and the decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is done not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Voting Hammeths scandal in East London.
Last year, a special court hearing the election issues ruled that the current mayor, Luftour Rahman, was to be removed from office due to a long list of corruption and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman had “cynically distorted” the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced its critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, “was campaign based on the duty of Muslim believers to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questioned or the result of person, when a person votes, introducing himself to someone else.
Sir Eric said there have been evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concerns about postal voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly put pressure on people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made several recommendations for cleaning the voting system, including the requirement to bring your identity card to prove who you are
His report said: “Evidence of pressure exerted on vulnerable members of certain ethnic minority communities, in particular women and young people, was presented to ensure that they voted by the will of the elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"Were of fear that... State institutions have turned a blind eye to this behavior because of the excessive sensitivity of “political correctness” over ethnicity and religion.
Cohe Eric gave 50 recommendations for cleaning the system, including the removal of political activists from working with the ballot papers to stop the “collection of votes.”
The report, under consideration by Theresa May, also calls for tighter registration checks to prevent the use of the voter list for immigration and privilege fraud.
The option is to require voters to present an identity card before voting.
Use indelible ink on people’s fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
Conduct systematic checks of the nationality of the people to make sure they have the right to vote.
Enter a three-year restriction on applications for automatic mail voting.
Remove political participants of campaigns and activists from working with filled in absentia voting and envelopes with postal voting.
Give the police the authority to install cordons around the polling stations.
Change the law to facilitate the intimidation charges against people in accordance with the 1983 People's Act.
Make illegal photography at polling stations.
Demand that only English be used at polling stations (except for Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that the staff forces the voters to go to the booth one by one.
Sir Eric fiercely attacks the city police, saying it was “amazing” that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The court, which is considering election issues, disqualified Lutfura Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal actions,” he said.
He was found guilty in the absence of a reasonable doubt – a criminal standard of proof – for a number of grounds.
He also criticized the inconclusive “checks for the sake of a tick” of the departments of election registration of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud legacy as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy in the cycling analogue of Kate and other doppelgangers of the Celebrity of the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy with the French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prevo, who turned out to be impressively similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old participant of the Olympic Games is not the only athlete fighting for gold this summer, who can boast of her own famous double – at least according to reports in social networks.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous people appearing on our screens at the moment, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians with more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and Wolf: A member of the men's team of archers Brady Ellison, on the left, was compared with Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate’s double on the bike path, a lot of people online rushed to point out how a certain archer could be a twin of the superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
A member of the men’s team of archers Brady Ellison was the cause of the hurricane on Twitter, after there were images of him, looking frightening to the Wolf star of Wall Street.
And in fact, the archer learned about the insanity of social networks and admitted that he had heard that he looked like Leo since he was a child.
“I personally don’t see a huge resemblance, maybe except vegetation on my face,” Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be indicated even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rasterford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliy Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be an exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the basin of the South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burga was compared with the star of the Choir Matthew Morrison for many years.
Moving to more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan is a “sports version” of the actor “Beginning”
Another long-standing comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast of similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer from Russia Yulia Efimova boasts not only the same tanned skin and blond hair like the actress AnnaLinn McCord, while Nathan Adrian from the US team, according to fans, is similar to the “sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt”.
Severe women: Football star Hope Solo, on the left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, on the right, have the same facial and eyes
Not the only one Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw similarities
According to this user, there may be a reason underlying the similar appearance of this pair
One Twitter user recently turned to the site to unveil his delight that “the other internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical.”
In fact, the football star of the United States and actress Dexter have incredibly similar shapes of the face and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as the gold medalist Gabby Douglas, who boasts her own beautiful broad smile, which looks like the star’s smile “Success” Gabriel Union.
CBC commentator apologises for saying about Chinese swimmer “died like a pig”
Analysis byron McDonald's fourth place at the finish line of 14-year-old Ay Yanhan on the women's freestyle relay 4x200 m outraged in the CBC viewers in the live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer would “start like a stench” and “died as a pig” during the swim.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was disabled when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200 m freestyle relay.
It was possible to hear how MacDonald, who was attracted to the team of CBC commentators to “dilute it with color,” said: “This 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, the baby.”
Too excited, started like a stench, died like a pig.
Thanks for that.
Chinese swimmer AY Yanhan, who is 14 years old, swam the second stage of the relay for 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing Canadians to eliminate the lag from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly on the network after being shaken by tone and used expressions
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: “Are CBC announcer really saying that a 14-year-old swimmer from China ‘died like a pig’?????
This idiot didn’t realize they were still on the air.”
About Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 freestyle relay said: "This little 14-year-old Chinese woman dropped the ball, baby."
Twitter criticism immediately hit Byron MacDonald, with many calling for him to fire
Twitter users could not resist when they heard how insensitive was Byron Macdonald
Another Twitter user Sarah Paradis wrote, “Wows #ByronMacDonald.
You introduce CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who was broadcast by the CBC, apologized live for MacDonald’s comment, saying, “We are apologizing for making a comment about a swimming performance hit.”
It was a bad choice of words, we are sorry that it happened.”
SAS ended by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to this statement
A friend of the commentator Scott Russell had to apologize on behalf of McDonald
CBC then copied and sent their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments
The web also hastened to apologize and publish a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on the air.
Last night we acted quickly to apologize to our viewers live and our subscribers in social networks.
We will clarify, Byron’s comments were about the performance of the swimmer, and not to her as a person.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unsuccessful choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized live and tried to clarify his comment, saying he didn’t think his words were being interpreted as an attack on a person.
“I would like to take a moment to apologize for the commentary I made last night after the women’s relay,” he said on the CBC Olympics broadcast.
“I talked about the performance of the swimmer, not about her personally.”
“It goes without saying that there was no disrespect, and I am very sorry.”
Buyer Primark insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of a store
Buyers did not know where to look at when a woman was naked to try on panties, on the floor with shops in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried on how she looked in them, pulled them down and put them back on the shelf.
She continued the search and eventually measured four pairs of underwear at the store of the shopping center Bouverie Place in Folxton.
The shopkeeper Primark of the Bauverie Place shopping center in Folxton, where a woman tried on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
The mother of two children Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the store, said that after fitting underwear, the mysterious woman again “dressed and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Stand in the middle of the trading hall, she took a couple of panties from the window, took off her own pantyhose and panties and put on them.
"She didn't try to find a secluded place somewhere to do it - she just stood there, shameless."
“Everyone stared when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn’t like them because she put them back on the shelf.”
She did the same thing with the other three pairs before she finally decided that there was nothing here that she would like, she was dressed again and came out.
“It didn’t look like she was cared about who watched her, or that she thought of the man who would eventually buy those underwear she tried on.”
Jenny Davidson, from Kent, said, “It’s disgusted to think that someone is going to take home the cowards that someone else has already worn and they weren’t wasted.”
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I'm inferring that the staff apparently tried to remove these items from sale, after she left - well, the better."
“I wouldn’t want to come home with a new pair of women’s underwear and find that another woman put on and took them off and they weren’t washed.”
A Primark spokesman said: “Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folxton on Tuesday, August 9.”
All the goods in question were withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a gun using a krama
The world around you is dangerous, but it’s a video from Dailymail.com, may help make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, the Craftsman’s Craftsman in New York, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they come to you from the front or behind, this video will show you how to beat the robber with his own weapon.
If they fit in the back, according to Misrachi, the first thing to do is to turn around so that you see the attacker and “free the line of fire.”
Then you tightly squeeze the gun between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face of a free elbow.
Then the knee follows in the groin, and while the attacker bends from the pain, you twist the gun from his hands, beat it in the face with a barrel and go back, holding the weapon induced on him.
For an armed, suitable front, the method of performing is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab a gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and hit the attacker with your head in the chest, then turn the gun out of its grip before you step back and target it.
Does it sound hard?
Watch the video to see exactly how Misrachi does.
But remember that the safest way out of any robbery – if you’re not a master of crav-magic – is to give away your cash.
For the guide, traveler Jan Wright conducts his language to the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler has subjected his immune system and gag reflex to a serious test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The leading and author of travel books, Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk, spent the language on the euro banknote, the circulation of Circa Piccadiley, the toilet button on the train and the Russian public phone to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what it gets into.
But the experiment, which should be a film called “Lisuna Travel Guide to the Inner Force”, gave some amazing results.
The thought of licking the flush button on a train used by thousands of others may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout the trip to Europe, Wright spoke with doctors and medical workers about increasing gut bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, none of the licked gave him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railings at the train stations to the button to the toilet flushing button, this task undoubtedly experienced its immune system
In the film he shot, he said, “From my childhood, I’ve been completely carefree about my health and I’ve pulled a lot of different things in my mouth, eating worms and dirty water.”
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
Its trial stroke demonstrated a phosphate value exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison: the hands just washed should be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that it refused to lick after the value of its luminometer was more than 4000 units, while the just-washed hands show less than 60
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio shot a film about a traveler called "Lisun Travel Guide on the Inner Force", which demonstrates the number of bacteria in different places, for example in the toilet
In the film, he said: “It’s close to one of the worst things I sniffed in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
"Guide to the Inner Lisun Guide" was removed along with the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains fermented milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help accelerate the growth of human intestinal bacteria and develop the immune system.
Valio’s senior Vice President, by snacks, juices and new categories, Nico Vuorenmaa, said: “We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time could explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan."
They argue that interest in bowel health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a greater context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of gut health, and how it is related to the immune system.
Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about this in an interesting form.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was the director of the film, added: “Say: I would have lost respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film.”
Naturally, some things to Jan was easier to lick, and some were quite tough.
I am glad that some of these licks have been filmed.”
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84 percent of respondents linked fermented fermented bacteria exclusively to a good condition for the stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they consumed at least occasionally products containing added fermented acid bacteria.
The family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, the municipal house Cornwall, on the eve of eviction
The hooligan family left their municipal home with losses of £50 000 after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilkok were kicked out of their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, shocked officials of housing and construction cooperatives found this property in a state that requires repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floorboards were opened, the garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were stained with graffiti.
The family is now resettled and is expected to live in a private apartment
Donna McAvoy, a resettler in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she couldn't be saved.
She said, “It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I don’t think people should live like this.
There are many things to weigh because this property will probably be known as not a very good Cornwall aspect.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.
The couple have three sons who lived in real estate from time to time, and police say the realm of the horror calculating family included fights on the street with baseball bps, intimidating residents of nearby areas, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive cries, disputes and swearing.
Skheldon, 47 whose name was on the lease agreement, received an anti-social behavior warrant in June.
In several rooms of the house, which may be demolished, found old garbage
Floor boards in the house in which drugs were sold in the past were pulled out
Neighbors say they saw fights on the street and regularly called the police
Cornwall Housing forcibly evicted her and her partner’s house this week after they were given an extended period of 11 weeks for a voluntary departure.
The eviction was welcomed by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into hell.
One said, “They didn’t care anyone.”
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we saw the police here is incredible.
"I couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, it's gonna be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing team, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and to the same time called the police regularly
Garbage and old toys were scattered below the overgrown side of the municipal house
He added: “It’s a shame that the tenant has not been able to take any responsibility for the behavior of her and her family, as eviction is always the last method of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very complex case, as the behavior was ultimate, and their actions must have been horrific to its observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and members of the Devon and Cornwall community, who bravely performed to give us information.
I hope that this development will give a little consolation to the neighbors and send a signal that anti-social behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said that they all were a little more than 20 at the time.
Dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after eviction
Resettlement workers will now have to remove the pums of garbage that surrounds the house
In 2014, the police searched the house and found more than 70 grams of hemp, as well as scales, appropriate accessories and 1,700 £ in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to class B drug possession for delivery.
She said the money was going to pay the tombstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After they were made homeless, there is evidence that Tanya and her partner now live in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms of the house were stained with graffiti over the entire surface.
The police say that they will try to evict tenants who do not obey the rules of renting a room
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall’s police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
“This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the accusations of the prosecutor, as well as those who are harmed by such behavior,” she said.
Criminal and antisocial behavior will never be tolerated by the police of Devon and Cornwall, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying warplane, almost touched the beach
In the city of Aveiro in Portugal, tourists who love to soak up in the sun, terribly frightened for their lives
The P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low
Air Force reported that he was carrying out a training flight, but insisted on no security risk
Here’s the moment when frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when a low-flying plane has spitting over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost at a touch distance from hunters on the beam of sand stripes in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The holidaymakers jumped on their feet as soon as they became understandably concerned about the noise of the aircraft engines, but not being able to see what was moving in their direction through the clouds.
The incident occurred last night near the city of Aveiro in Kostana Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the several vacationers who posted a video of a shocking flight on social media, said: “He flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point it seemed that he would break.”
Nuno Arroga added: “I was surfing and I swear there was a feeling that the plane was about to fall on me.”
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were terribly frightened when the plane appeared from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the P-3C Orion pilot was flying a training flight to detect fishing vessels off the shore, and was forced to fall so low, as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot said the plane flew a little lower than usual because of the lack of visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was at risk.
This summer, forest fires caused damage to the mainland of Portugal, and also claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances - a thick fog and smog from forest fires, which worsened visibility
The aircraft performed a training flight, and the pilot was tasked with detecting fishing boats as part of the task
The system "HASSP" has been mandatory for catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet been implemented.
Checks are becoming more active, and business faces fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system, in the Russian version of HACCP) - risk analysis and critical control points - is mandatory for the use of food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the catering sector in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (TS).
Checks of the business by Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But while officials issue fines only for certain violations of the regulations (see. "List of documents"...)
Non-fulfillment of the regulations as a whole will cost the company 600 thousand. rubles for the first violation and in 1 million rubles - for the second.
HACSP as a system that takes into account the risks when working with food and prevents them was invented in the United States in the 1960-ies.
Then it was about the safety of food for astronauts.
Now the system is used in all food enterprises not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, HACCP has been operating on the territory of the Customs Union.
For the development and implementation of the system, the business was 4 years old (the requirement of HACCP appeared in the technical regulation of the CU in 2011).
However, both entrepreneurs themselves and officials admit that most companies have not even heard of this norm.
Unfortunately, we, for a long time were sure that the norm applies only to food production, and not restaurateurs, - explained the head of the Public Council Elena Tsereteli.
Now everyone is trying to catch up.
The expected period of resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August - early September.
But they will not cause a rush of demand, since their target audience - families with children - is already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday with a request to allow charters.
“For many Russian tourists, the issue of choosing a high-quality and affordable sea holiday is insoluble, since most accommodation facilities have already been booked in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea until the end of September,” the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter transportation in August will not significantly affect the already existing demand for Russian sea tourist.
According to the North-Western regional branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry (PCT), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding when the charters are resumed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, planes can fly in September, even in August, if tour operators quickly build programs and agree with airlines on the sides needed on the direction, ”says Pavel Rumyantsev, deputy director for communications and international projects of the North-Western regional branch of the PCT.
According to him, the possible resumption of charters is good news, but will not affect the balance of power in the market, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or spend their holidays in other countries.
During the velvet season, tours are bought mainly by single travelers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously, ”says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists, if it now gives very budget proposals - 50-60 thousand. rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are purposefully waiting for very cheap tours, ”says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of the Otio-Travel travel agency.
Otherwise, it is definitely not worth counting on the hype - the bulk of the trips have already been planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but you should not expect a hype.
“For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal of the next season,” says Pavel Rumyantsev.
“The opening of charters in Turkey is positive news for the next season,” agrees Valery Rubtsov.

London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiz Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS reportedly killed in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnym Akoundi said that her family learned about her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
It is assumed that she died from a Russian air strike in Raqqa, a stronghold of the group in the country, as reported by ITV News on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and, according to her family, she died just when she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
“One can only hope that the only advantage of this is like a tombstone and will to others that these are the risks that are in the case of traveling to the war zone – to dissuade people ever to make the same choice,” said Akoundi.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then on a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and had become a widow for months.
Reed says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the post of Supreme Judge in the event of election
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reed says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if elected as president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland’s claim as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
The leader of the majority group in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, says the next president will choose the person who can replace the last judge of the Supreme Court Antonina Scalia.
Reid said at a conference call on Thursday that he predicts that Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of confidence."
Reid later said he didn’t talk to Clinton directly about whether she would put forward Garland and just made assumptions.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to “rock the boat” with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Justice of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reid said Republicans who are blocking Garland’s nominations are “hello” and “accomplices” of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not suitable for office.

Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is too.
“We need to get back to a demonstration of an eternal and classical nude figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can serve photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.

The ultimate vinyl consumer: who actually buys records?
Single middle-aged men love vinyl.
And until you rushed to clog the comment section with gross insults under the pseudonymNot LoneMedieval, this statement follows from the actual data.
According to YouGov, so much the discussion of the revival of records is due not to a boom among the generation of two thousand, who want to penetrate the novelty of the material object, but the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album with a high degree of probability are between the ages of 45 and 54, according to data.
Moreover, those who belong to the age group of 18-24 years are the least likely.
It’s also not just an act of gathering by amateurs – it has an emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are somewhat more likely to hold their feelings in themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy loneliness (69% vs. 66%).
But are YouGov results true?
If this blog were a television news report, the camera would follow me while I was walking through the center of the busy Soho Street, in a modest gray suit and ugly gesticulating before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, “Let’s see.”
Okay, let's see.
While Soho’s heart is slowly stripped of its charm and dirt – hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops now flooded buildings once occupied by independent sellers – a few music stores with fantastic specialists still remained.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, in which I am close to different people in some of these stores and try to assess their age and emotional attitude with the help of observation.
A native of Glasgow Stewart, 55, who was following from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20 years old), in London for half a day to hold a meeting, and skips shopping to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
“I guess so,” he says.
I have about 3000 or 4 000 records.
These records, depicted above (he sent me an e-mail a picture, I did not chase him home), go line the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles partly follows from his disposinged income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they first came out and buy out the items that he sold when he was young and in the ground.
“More of what I’m buying is the late 60’s, the early 1970s, things that came out when I was 11 or 12, things I was probably too young to buy,” he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are likely to be introverts who like their own company, adding: “I don’t smoke, I don’t drink a lot.
This is my weakness.
Uez, who has been working at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the hype in the media, people who heard about the return and felt the responsibility to redeem their old records.
Judging by the conversations I had, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their records,” he says.
This may explain the boom among the figures of the revival of vinyl of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional importance of records?
It is enough to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to understand that plate stores offer a comfortable society to people with similar views.
According to Weez, some older customers, in particular, are offended by a cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel shocked by the digital world and prefer to move into the constancy of familiar envelopes for records, objects that awaken memories of serene youth.
“I think sometimes it could be filling emptiness or possessing material things as a kind of calming,” says Uez.
Since I am a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people do, too.
It’s an easy way to take your head.
“We are like their social workers!” – said a colleague from the racks rack.
An ICM survey found that nearly 50 percent of the people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this stage of the news report, I would probably look seriously puzzled, scrolling through the rack with Bosanow collections.
The “Trophy” aspect of rebirth is what Johnny has noticed, 42 years old who has been working at Sounds of the Universe.
“Someone came recently and said, ‘I don’t have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on to the shelf,’” he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More than a part of the product, less music.
We have people who say, “I don’t have a record player.”
These are younger people, not the elderly, they are a little less than twenty who are just getting acquainted with it.
The Fopp, who has now taken almost the entire floor of vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I am coming.
There are couples over 70, tourists who are photographed, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the above stores — the last sexy and sexy pop Wild Beast, not jazz improvisation, makes its way through the speakers — it’s nice to see the variety in their customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it is difficult to establish a tense of 30 seconds next to someone.
Eleanor, 27, went to Fopp for a few minutes, looking at various records available for sale.
She looks at the goods, not spends money.
She does not earn much, according to her, so collecting records is not a very suitable option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is simple, but the beauty of vinyl is ...,” she immerses herself in dreams with a sigh full of love.
I don’t know how to explain – it’s really unique.
My last stop is the store, which is said to have contributed to the emergence of a new generation of vinyl lovers: City Fashionports.
While I’m creating the illusion that I’m looking at denim-fitting shorts, I’m watching a group of teenage girls gathering around Polaroid camera every minute before the father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase, the wall of which is set by the plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mack: a mixture of modern style and classics, mandatory records for any middle collection.
No one is looking – perhaps because they are just an ornament, some are located so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
It's a real "artistic vinyl."
But, given that any attention to these items can mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the Soho outback for some time, there is almost nothing to complain about.
Not surprisingly, a layer of population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the layer that spends most of the money on luxury goods like vinyl.
But as long as my findings suggest that YouGov’s results are accurate, at least in Soho records stores, they do not exclude the existence of a huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in reality, records stores and online forums.
These people are probably working hard in school or office.
But they clearly do not spend the morning of Thursday, walking through the shops of records on Berwick Street, scrolling through the records and avoiding the views of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake presenter who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.

French court rejects proposal to demolish stores in the Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected Calé’s offer to demolish dozens of homemade shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At this week’s court hearings, Calé authorities said that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to cut or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or simple meals for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
Cale Prefecture said that these places should be demolished because they are a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants are vital, stating that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups do not provide enough food for the growing number of camp.
They said homemade shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to expel the people driving 72 homemade stores, but said that the problems of Calais’ prefecture “were completely clear.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said that groceries, cafes and restaurants played a much bigger role than just feeding people who "live in extremely shaky conditions."
He said that the spaces were provided with calm points of the meeting of refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites that was at risk of demolition was the children's cafe book of the camp, which does not work for profit and offers 200 lunches a day, classes in English and French and asylum consultations for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170 000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
The letter sent to the Guardian said its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are not older than eight."
Two charities, Helping Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number in the Jungli camp has grown and exceeded 9 000 people — the highest in history — after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
Libraries of microdistricts invite young freemen to informative programs.
This week, the branches of the library will hold meetings dedicated to the Day of the City, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Sportsman.
Programs are aimed at a children's audience, so for the most part will pass in a game form.
Today, August 10, the library-branch No. 2, in the valuin microdistrict, invites to the cruise-presentation "My Town is small".
On August 11, the regional hour "I live in this city, I know this city."
In the library-branch No. 2 on the same day, a multimedia lesson "Earth of the past destiny" will be held.
And in the library-branch No. 4 in Surazhevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, for children from the northern microdistrict, the library-branch No. 3 will hold a game program "Phoot-Hello!".
Britain stops for silver in rugby-7, after the Fiji master class allows them to take gold
The impressive UK series in Rugby 7 was crushingly stopped at the final disobedience of the Fiji team in the final on Thursday evening, when they were completely defeated 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class on possession of the ball, spacing, evashenes, support of the game, running lines and brute force to win gold - their first Olympic medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of silver – Britain’s third in the day – and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Rugby 7 Olympic tournament, in which New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa won the way.
The painful beating of Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals earlier in the same day, could return to adversely affect them in the final.
But, no matter what, Fiji in this form won the team of 15 people in this form.
This may be some consolation for the UK – but probably not – that at least one Briton will hang a gold medal tomorrow next: Fiji’s head coach Ben Ryan, former Wimbledon chief of England.
It was a journey for the UK.
Eight years ago, near Ryan, they lost every game on Adeleide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
These blows will cause pain, but the progress is astonishing.
Fiji began great, for fun brewing Britain’s attempts to intercept the ball.
It was like coming into a convoy of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0 when the Ausa Colinisau diverged into the corner.
With four minutes on the watch, Jerry Touai added another tachdown on the right flank, which was implemented.
12-0 and the UK barely touched the ball.
A great attempt to intercept Mitchell kept the man-mountain Leon Nakarav from storing a third, but this only detained Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremalua made a touchdown in the right corner, and the UK lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another after the resumption and there was still more than a minute on the clock ... in the first half.
Vatemo Ravovoo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to get a point.
The implementation led to 29-0 in the break.
It looked like Fiji was born to play rugby-7, while Britain was still mastering the craft.
Which is largely so.
Britain made mass substitutions on half of the game, and they clogged the fijian dam. for all four minutes that by the standards of the first half was good until Joshua Tuisov passed after several brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed an attempt for the UK, making a touchdown in the left corner to be 36-7, but the game long ago followed the path of the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the full joy of Fiji’s approach.
Mata William embellished a fijic cake that did not need embellishment, another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the UK fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji defeated Japan 20-5 in their semi-finals, and Britain went a little bit in South Africa in the tense semi-final of one attempt for each - the difference between the British implementation.
Kyle Brown takes Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great legwork, broke the line and scored under the beams in the second half.
The brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, brother 15-way to the England team, Anthony, secured the victory – and ultimately a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing coach with cancer
There will be no more exciting gold in these games, and it says something.
From the first movement to the last, 220 heavy ups in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment on the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there until they sought the second consecutive Olympic gold in women's couples, the first women in the annals of British sports, who reached such a height.
Their superiority was absolute, in the end it was their 39-th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes, sliding on the surface with the elegance of swans, do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold rowing battalion of ready-made hands, contributing to the gradually increasing victories that are important, and there are no hands that were more important than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, did not know if he would live to see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of what they can operate and they did.
If they don't, it's everywhere.
It could be a pretty bad situation.
It changes your views a bit for the future.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky that he could start treatment in early 2014 in the off-season, keeping the schedule gap minimal if it could be the right expression in circumstances like these.
I needed payment, so I had to get better.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and walked around the department — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, although they were talking a few steps enough.
This is how it starts.
Rowing in itself is a journey, but it does it a little more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were about Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, the captain of the artillery regiment with service in Afghanistan behind her shoulders, said: “I was an emotional ruin this week, maybe it’s a bit too much, but it means so much.”
It just confirms how much it means to me, how much I and Helen worked, and Robin too.
It was a fantastic three-year-old with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so thank you very much, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t ask for the best partner for training or the best coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
This pair sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very in the phase.
Helen called, “Leave in progress, stay in the process.”
Now it is very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we did not try to do something amazing.
We didn’t expect fireworks today, we just expected to be able to warm up well and go out and win this race, which we did.
It will take a year for the couple to decide their future.
Glover must be at the wedding next month, on her own with her own adventurer Steve Beckshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn’t mean to say that this is my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to realize that I became an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel so much better,” she said.
The government has extended the period of destruction of sanctions products
The government extended until the end of 2017 the period of destruction of food products prohibited for import into Russia.
The corresponding resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, it is published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against the countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
Subsequently, the ban has been repeatedly extended, now it is valid until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and food from the United States, the EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
Disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.

The panel of arbitrators of the WTO found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil are contrary to the rules of the organization.
Import rates exceed the commitments made by Russia when joining the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has made a decision against Russia," the organization said in a statement.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union did not provide sufficient evidence that Russia’s measures “were systematic” or “were comprehensive.”
Russia, in turn, promised in the near future to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators.
This is stated in the message of the Ministry of economic development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization on the actions of Russia, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that US behavior in resolving controversial issues in the WTO undermines the principles of the discussion adopted in the organization.
A similar statement was made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the refusal of the Americans to approve for a second term by South Korean judge Chan Sung-hwa.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It currently has 162 countries.
Russia joined it in 2012.
In the presidential administration changed the head
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed former Sergei Ivanov deputy Anton Vaino as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin reshuffled in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino during the meeting said that he considers the anti-corruption work that Ivanov began to carry out as head of the presidential administration, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the reshuffle nothing will fundamentally change in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head who worked in the presidential administration for a long time has left, effectively built the activities of the AP.
Instead, the deputy head of the administration Anton Vaino came - a man who is well aware of the specifics of this work.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The state-owned Polish oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from the Russian Federation may become unattractive for it due to a reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was announced by the Vice-President of the Polish financial company Bohuslav Mazhets.
His words are reported by TASS.
“It may happen that we will not buy gas at all, we will diversify our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main directions of supply for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG-terminals and Norway,” said Mazhets.
Currently, Gazprom occupies a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier in the first half of 2016 delivered almost 5.3 billion cube to it. m of gas, which is 30% higher than the level of 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in the procurement of PGNIG rose to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the antitrust department of Poland did not agree on the creation of a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
At the same time, a month earlier, Poland left a request to Gazprom for the supply of 11 billion cubic meters. m gas through the "Nord stream-2".
This was stated by Deputy Chairman of the Board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of Nord Stream 2 will take place in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
At the end of May it was reported that Gazprom does not plan to take any action in connection with the intentions of the Polish side to refuse long-term contracts for the supply of gas from Russia after 2022, said Deputy Chairman of the Board of the company Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles only increased gas purchases from the Russian Federation by 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the very fact of filing a statement by the Polish PGNIG in the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean the termination of negotiations.
Earlier, the Polish company appealed to the court to reduce the purchase price of Russian gas.
We will remind, the Commissioner of the Polish government on gas and energy infrastructure Peter Naimsky said that the Polish authorities decided not to renew the contract with “Gazprom” for the supply of gas.
Poland’s contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the representative of the Polish government for gas and energy infrastructure, Petr Naimski, said that his country in six years could refuse to supply blue fuel from the east.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 provides for the construction of two lines of the offshore gas pipeline with a total capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. m gas per year from Russia to Germany under the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was announced by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
“I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area,” he said, answering a question from journalists.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers tracked what was happening at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
In the Network there was a video of the Yak-42 passenger plane that landed at the airport of Ufa, which rolled out of the runway at 400 m and fell on the left wing.
The video was published by the TV channel “360”.
The incident occurred at 4.30 Moscow time.
The flight of the airline "KrasAvia"" arrived from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, there were no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
Ufa Airport is operating normally.
The Volga investigative department on transport of the TFR was engaged in finding out the reason for the hard landing of the aircraft of the liner.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All parties to the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the fact that the incident is indisputable.
Similar statements were made on the eve of the third round of intra-Syrian talks, which are to begin at the end of August in Geneva.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first information about the terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, appeared on August 2.
Then the opposition said that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the aircraft dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but in Moscow these accusations were called a throw-in.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry accused the opposition group Harakat Nur al-Din al-Zinki of what happened.
Soon it became known that the bombs filled with toxic gas were two.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
“A few minutes later, I smelled the gas, began to burn the eye, it became difficult to breathe,” the newspaper quotes the words of the eyewitness.
As a result of the attack, at least 7 people were killed, 23 were hospitalized.
If the fact of the use of poison gas is confirmed by experts, the actions will be regarded as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: “There is a lot of evidence that this has really happened.”
The inadmissibility of the use of chlorine for military purposes is prescribed in the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
Despite the fact that all parties to the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of the use of chlorine by the Syrian army against the “moderate opposition”.
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the shelling of its areas is carried out daily, and terrorists prevent the withdrawal of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a “humanitarian pause” in military operations.
The current regime of the daily three-hour lull in the organization considers “insufficient to help almost 2 million civilians trapped”.
Staffan de Mistura’s humanitarian adviser Jan Egeland said a 48-hour ceasefire would be required to deliver aid and evacuate the sick and wounded to the city.
“We have to send voluminous cargoes from a convoy of trucks in an area where roads are almost destroyed, and those that remain are mined,” Egeland said. “But the Russian delegation confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table.”
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the United States and Russia on the establishment of a “humanitarian pause” continue.
How Russia opened the “humanitarian windows” in Aleppo
In the context of the ongoing battle for Aleppo, Russia, Russia on 11 August announced the introduction of a three-hour cessation of hostilities, which will operate daily from Thursday.
The creation of “humanitarian windows” is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was made against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the requirement to curtail the military operation and contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
As a result of a series of explosions in the resorts of Thailand killed four people.
Several explosions occurred in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
As a result of the attack, four people were killed, 19 were injured.
The epicenter of the explosions fell on the city of Hua-Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, there are no Russians among them.
None of the terrorist groups has yet claimed responsibility for the incident, but the interior Ministry of the country hastened to declare that the Islamists are not involved in it.
Several people have already been detained on suspicion of organizing the explosions.
According to preliminary data of the local police, the scale and features of the explosions indicate that they were directed against the military heads of the country.
The attacks occurred at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuketa and Hua-Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the arrival of the military junta in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012) to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries that demonstrated development.
In 2016, the country has already been visited by 14 million people, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of attacks have already been detained, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen said.
It is too early to talk about targets, he added, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the country "sure that they are not connected with international extremist groups."
It is too early to draw conclusions, - said Mr. Patanacharoen. -
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, in fact, these are local sabotage, and we are trying to identify those who stood behind them.
The explosions occurred on the birthday of Queen of Thailand Sycrite.
The Thai junta considers the protection of the monarchy one of its main priorities, so the incident is most likely directed against it.
According to Police General Sithich Srisopaparanorat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four victims was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identities of the other victims are still unknown, but it is known that they are residents of four foreign states.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them four German citizens, three Dutch citizens, two Italian citizens and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of Rosturizm reported.
Local experts also associate the explosions with the referendum held on August 7, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft of the new constitution.
It was prepared by the commission for the drafting of the constitution, appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system in which the upper house of parliament was fully appointed by the military and had a significant role in the election of the country's prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand under the leadership of the commander of the army of the country, Prayuth Chan-Ocha.
The army was prompted by the ongoing political crisis and the lack of progress in the negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed a curfew and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok is in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, in January 2014 announced a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces adjacent to the capital.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
There were two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, in the center of Bangkok, at the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests took place, two explosions occurred, as a result of which 28 people were injured, five of them were in critical condition.
The explosions were made by unknown people on motorcycles.
The authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and recruited military forces to protect the demonstrators.
In the Dry Log began the development of conditions.
As it became known to Kommersant, the government is invited to agree on a draft of the auction for the Sukhoi Log gold deposit with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed to prevent a company where 25% and more is owned by foreigners, and those applicants whose capital will not be at least 25% of state participation.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
The auction can be announced in August, and will be held in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources submitted to the government a draft order and auction conditions for the largest undeveloped gold deposit in Russia Suha Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two Kommersant sources familiar with the situation told.
The project was introduced on Wednesday evening, one of them clarifies.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project was submitted to the government.
The representative of Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Khloponin, who oversees the subsoil use, told Kommersant that the project had not yet been received to the official’s office.
"The auction can be announced in August, immediately after the release of the government's order, and taking into account the deadline for collecting applications of potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may take place in October," the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to Kommersant, the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, prescribed in the version, which was sent for approval to ministries and FOIVs in July (Kommersant has).
The first is the presence of applicants in the capital of at least 25% of state participation.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies under the control of foreign investors, based on the understanding of FZ-57 on foreign investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law specified in the draft, as Kommersant already wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be allowed to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, since the Dry Log refers to the subsoil of federal significance (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project “contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies,” but refused to comment on the details before the government’s orders.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, Kommersant in December 2015 in the Ministry of Natural Resources and was later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Natural Resources by his predecessor Sergei Eroshchenko, “who had agreements on investment projects with Rostec”.
Who lobbied for the restriction on the admission of foreigners, the interlocutors of “Kommersant” do not specify.
“But this is in the spirit of the time: not to give control in the largest gold deposit in Russia against the background of Western sanctions,” says the interlocutor of Kommersant, familiar with the preparation of the auction.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy on August 1 said that foreigners “can go to the consortium” if the applicants will attract them “as a financial structure, technological partners.”
The interlocutors of Kommersant consider it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for Sukha Log in the industry is the consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC Polyus, controlled by the son of Suleiman Kerimov Said, and Rostec.
As Kommersant wrote, in July, the partners created the joint venture SL Gold, where Polyus has 51% of shares, the structure of Rostec RT-Gr has 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, the Polys told Kommersant that "certainly interested in this asset" and have all the necessary competencies and resources for its development.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions," the "Polyus" added.
ALROSA can participate in the auction, but the decision is up for the government of the Russian Federation, Kommersant sources said.
The possibility of participation in the development of Sukhoi Log was stated by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which develops assets in Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to Kommersant, are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of gold mines of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated “Kommersant” investments in the Sukhoi Log at $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most of the potential applicants are deterred not only by the volume of investments, but also by the complexity of the project: serious reconnaissance of reserves and technologies with complex ores are needed, Kommersant’s interlocutors in the industry explain.
In the pension market started the largest transaction M&A - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" launched the process of combining four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the Gas Fund Pension Savings, NPFs will be created with an accumulation of about 373 billion rubles.
On the launch of the procedure for the unification of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfond Pension Savings" - said yesterday the owner of 100% of the funds of LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator".
"The reorganization is carried out in coordination with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of non-determination of the terms of existing contracts," the company said in a statement.
The association is held on the basis of "Gazfond Pension Savings".
As Oleg Byalosezyk, CEO of this NPF, notes, the association of funds allows you to solve several problems: expanding the geography of presence, concentration of resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the approximate deadline for the completion of consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger of NPF "Gazfond Pension Savings" will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the volume of pension savings of uniting funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reporting website on the funds website, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through the controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group itself launched much later competitors.
So, controlled by the group O1 NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalffond" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this joint NPF is joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
“Unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems,” said Nikolai Sidorov, general director of NPF Future.
Active work on the consolidation of funds since April is in the pension group "Safmar" - NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfond" should join the NPF "Safmar" before the end of this year.
In 2017, NPF "Trust" will join them.
"The merger of the funds will give the effect of strengthening control over risks, operating processes and expenses," the Safmar pension group noted.
A pause in the pool of funds, which KIT Fiction Pension Administrator has withstood, can be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, the NPF could not buy more than 40% of the volume of the issue of infrastructure bonds, in which the group was actively placed.
After amending the Central Bank resolution in March of this year on a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator, there are no such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought by one large player, ”says Yuri Nogin, director of the group of ratings of financial institutions of ACRA.
Several NPF executives from the top 15 in terms of assets with another possible reason for the pause call the separation of spheres of influence and, as a result, personnel appointments in a single fund, which were supposed to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment.
At the request of "Kommersant" in NPF "Gazfond" also did not respond.
Although the consolidation of funds is a laborious and expensive event, this decision will be justified at a long distance.
As the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergey Okolesnov, "Gazfond Pension Savings" has less outflows, joining will stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, the more successful experience of NPF "KIT Finance" and "Promagrofond" in the construction of retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be in demand.
The requirements of the Central Bank for the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is impractical to duplicate the infrastructure at four funds with a single investment policy, according to Pavel Mitrofanov, managing director for corporate ratings of Expert RA.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will unequivocally block the possible costs of unification," Mr. Mitrofanov said.
The cost of combining four funds Sergey Okolesnov estimates at 30-50 million rubles.
“The cost of maintaining four funds of these sizes is about 400 million rubles. in a year, with consolidation in the medium term, the budget is really reduced by half, "Mr. Okolesnov is sure.
In the Russian box office came the goodest Disney movie “Pit and its dragon”.
Beautiful views of New Zealand, a scented dragon, a heartbreaking history and canter-style songs are enough to re-believe old-fashioned magic, says ELENA KRAVZZUN.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human cub and a gentle babysitter, and a devoted friend.
Pete calls his friend Elliot, in honor of the puppy from the book of fairy tales, plays with him in the catch-up and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he, overgrown and in a vacillary bandage, can no longer be distinguished from another smart forest limbath - Mowgli.
In this form, Pete discovers a red-haired female geyster Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard), while Gavin's brigade (Karl Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively rolls the forest.
Now she will have to not only believe in the existence of a dragon, but also help to save him.
Pete is undergoing an accelerated course of “being a man” surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in the heart and smile more dazzlingly than in any commercial.
No character looks or acts too horribly for the viewer to really hate him or fear him.
Even Gavin, who opened the hunt for an atypical inhabitant of the forests subject to him, is far from an incorrigible villain.
A huge fluffy dragon also turned out to be at all not terrible, with a good bulldog, an airliner wingspan and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny, murmursing, even grunts and, fortunately, does not, but he always wants to pet, this is advantageously different from all the famous cinematic dragons.
The visual image of Elliot and his manner ensure such a high degree of emotional engagement that in the most stressful moments they begin to cry desperately in three streams not only small spectators, but also adults.
Surprisingly good and young Oaks Figley as Pete, torn between a possible family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtuoso gives out a canonical grandfather, who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowry manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten Disney film “Dragon Pete” of 1977, mediocre from nose to the tip of the tail and remembered only by a mix of animation and feature film, and make it the most soulful film of this summer?
Nothing else the miracle helped.
In his painting, Lowry from the original, in fact, took only two things: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There were musical numbers and most of the strange jokes.
In this good fairy tale, the features borrowed from "Bambi", "Ac-Lenter" and many other cute children's paintings are read to the heart.
Disney continues to successfully expand the gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, “Pit and the Dragon” is not as stunning as the same “Jungle Book”, and there is no skillful villain in it, which was Kate Blanchett in the role of a stepmother in the new “Cinderella”.
But this naive film no less successfully helps to believe in miracles and good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magical Disney Castle, director Lowry will receive again - for an artistic film adaptation of the story about "Peter Peng".
Worked in “Fut and His Dragon” by tandem David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbroux entered a new ambitious project about a non-aging boy based on the eponymous fairy tale James Barry.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new charge
Lawyers of RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecutor’s office found flaws in the case of their client.
The fact that the prosecutor's office made such a presentation, we learned from the investigators just yesterday.
We had planned to participate in the court session on the issue of limiting the familiarization with the materials of the criminal case, but the meeting eventually did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor’s office, ”the lawyer Olga Dinze quotes RBC.
She said that the prosecutor’s office pointed out to the investigators inconsistencies in the qualification of the case and the collected materials.
Now investigators will have to eliminate gaps in the evidence base and bring a new charge to Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or the same will remain, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
As reported by Kommersant, Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the journalist of RBC the wording about “shaking the political situation towards instability” and “overthrowing the government by illegal means”.
Kommersantboscosport correspondent .O. . . . . . . . . . . . , lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the house of the Russian team, tedned in the local dining room and even passed a WADA test after that.
It seems that life here does not freeze for a second.
Even at night.
The last starts sometimes end in midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half to two to return to the Olympic Village.
In addition, unaissed settlement and eviction from the village are being carried out, since some athletes complete their performances and leave Brazil, and some, on the contrary, only come here.
Well, at 7:30 in the morning in one of the temporary tents stretch the heads of all Olympic delegations.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational household issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which ours were located, consider the exemplary - it was put into operation by one of the first and demonstrated to all the inspectors, even in it and then there are some underdebade.
Then with hot water problems, then, sorry, with toilets.
We fought for purity for a long time.
At first, no one came to get out.
Then the cliners began to come, but only shove some substance on the floor, and that's all.
They have floors, you see, some innovative ones.
They can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors - ordinary laminate!
In general, we have achieved a change of cleaning company and now all OK is with this.
The Olympic village is such a Southern Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, from others - an impressive moat, sometimes flooded with water.
Well, for reliability there is still a perimeter two-meter iron fence, along which the machine gunners are walking.
In total, the village can accommodate up to 17 thousand. 3,604 apartments located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-storey buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely given to the needs of our team.
Looking at a small foyer at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems, apparently, are the most urgent for the domestic team.
At the check-in desk hang two ads: printed "Please don't throw the paper to the toilet!" and by hand "I will accept as a gift of badges.
The rack itself is drowning in booklets.
Their cheerful color contrasts with the title of brochures: "Memo for infectious diseases for those leaving for Rio de Janeiro", "First aid for drowning, ingress of a foreign body into the respiratory tract, loss of consciousness - stages of cardiopulmonary resuscitation", "First aid for burns, heat strokes, fractures and bleeding."
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent cure.
However, a favorable outcome does not await everyone.
Of course, in the location of the Russian national team there is a medical center, which at any time is ready to provide residents with qualified assistance, including relaxing and sports massage.
Opposite the medical center is the headquarters of our delegation.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster “Despite nothing, we will win!”.
And, of course, poems:
All arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear them believe.
Let less of us, the sweeter the taste of victories, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for an even greater rise in spirit hangs an announcement: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of His Holiness Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia, spiritual care is provided by Archpriest Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev about the athletes of the Russian Olympic team.
You can order a prayer and other requirements by phone...
In general, on the territory of the village there is a Center of meditations and religious rites for representatives of all faiths.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Due to the workload of the elevator from the ninth floor to the fourth, I decided to go down the stairs, which is recommended to be used during the fire.
And in the dark stumbled on the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, these were sleeping employees of the new cleaning company.
I believe that in readiness at any time to rush to wash innovative floors, they decided to arrange a quiet hour directly on cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting for a meeting with a long-time friend - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our trampoline, who brought them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and the pupil, European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show his rooms.
There is nothing to complain about, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live on two, the beds, of course, are almost still standing, but it's uncritical.
The bathroom is one-on-four, but spacious.
The closet, of course, is funny, out of the fabric, does not cause trust, but things can be put.
"No, you're looking at it, their tea is over!" - dances with his hands tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, who met me in the main dining room.
The main one is called at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand. Q. m and is ready to take at the same time 5 thousand. visitors.
Here they give out on-mountain 60 thousand. portions per day for free.
The menu options are as follows: "Best from Brazil", "Cooks of the World", "Asia dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I peeled, is very popular with our volleyball players.
At the same time, say, I did not find soups in any of the divisions of a giant restaurant.
What kind of soups? - surprises Kuznetsov. - No tea!
It's good that I took Chinese with me, casserative.
And the kettle.
But in general, so that you understand, we have even worse food on the courts.
Here at least something can be chosen, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose a cod for a couple and meatballs in tomato sauce.
Next to each dish there is a tablet with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese, as well as indicating the nutritional value of the product and the presence of allergens in it.
Well, well, admittedly, it was edible.
I don’t even know why it’s always worth McDonald’s.
Satisfied, relaxed, we can say "warm" athletes at the exit from the restaurant waiting for our best friends - representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
Lumbark deftly - a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
Provoking, you might say!
To receive a gift, you need to correctly answer at least eight questions out of ten.
There are questions in Russian! - I was attacked by a girl from WADA.
But it was the wrong one.
That is, I was in a patriotic impulse, naturally.
The situation has escalated on the second question: “If I received a notification of the passing of doping control, should I immediately go to the doping control point?”
I stopped on the option B: "No - I have one hour."
Lost, so to speak, vigilance.
I forgot that there is no need to expect concessions from WADA.
In general, you need to be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage of the quiz, my position became quite critical.
For some reason, I thought that if it would be difficult for me to follow a balanced diet because of my tight schedule (and it’s hard for me by the way!), then I can use dietary supplements to get “additional nutrients to increase my performance.”
Ahn no, they can't!
More precisely, the answer is formulated in such a way that it is categorically not prohibited, but strongly, several proposals are dissuaded.
It's WADA's unfair!
What's up, Russia? - the quizing whisker asks the lead quiz.
There is nowhere to retreat - behind Efimova, Isinbayev and our entire devastated team.
So I focused and won the unfortunate T-shirt out of the last strength.
Know, as they say, ours!
In a victorious mood, I wandered into the fitness center next door.
Interested in the calculation of the simulators.
He lost 250.
I noted with surprise that in this heap, no Russian athlete was found in this heap.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who does not know how to play!
But in the nearby clinic, one of our guys was sitting.
In line to the oculist.
Don't worry, don't you want to shoot.
In the clinic, however, as well as throughout the village, wherever spit, hangs a device for issuing condoms.
It is written inciting call: "Flood with the condom!"
Then it remains only to cool the iron resembling a handle of the door lock, and the condom, made of natural latex Amazon, readily falls out of the device.
I took one for myself, in memory.
From the athletes will not leave - they were brought 450 thousand.
Just for a festive and idle pastime in the Olympic village there is a whole entertainment center.
Near it, just in case there is a informative plaque, reminiscent of that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The center is flooded with video games, billiards and tennis tables, table football and hockey and some strange devices, similar to video simulators.
What is it? - I am interested in a friend in the form of a Ukrainian team, who actively uses an outlandish toy.
He could, of course, simply say that he does not want to talk to a person in the form of a Russian national team, and that’s all.
Here, by the way, for some strange coincidence in the eyes ripens from the guys in the zhovto-blakitnaya.
The most playing team, it turns out.
To get around the whole village, looking into each corner, you need at least three hours.
But, if you go, and not to ride electric cars, you will open the house of the Canadian team with the entrance and the tent with the restorative bathroom, and the ticket office, and the laundry, and dry cleaning, and hairdressing, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and mail with unique brands (only you can still not wait out the queue of Chinese).
And late at night, you will, exhaustively, sit near an olive tree, hung with colorful ribbons in memory of the friends and relatives of athletes who left this world.
And you will be to the accompaniment of the machine, indiscriminately spraying the liquid for the killing of insects, think about the eternal.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village does not stop for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched with a bated breath, as the Australians almost punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that the news that Inna Deriglazova won gold in the rapier at the XXXI Olympic Games, I received the first.
Maybe I’m even the only Muscovite who saw how it happened – not counting those, of course, who watched the competition in Carioca that night.
Only a real fan can understand this.
Imagine: the deaf Moscow night.
Neighbors from below - as always by the hour of the night - wake up and begin to beglessly, but shout very loudly at each other.
Threatening the furniture.
In the kitchen flows the crane - there is no time to go to the market and buy, as asked by a new plumber.
In the television schedule, nothing is clear, so he just kept the channels “Match”, “First” and just in case “Russia” – although it is almost meaningless.
"Russia" is the birthplace of repetitions, the whole sport there is for some reason in the record.
There are live series broadcast.
Hope, of course, for the "Match" - the whole evening a young man shouted in news issues first about the great semifinals of Deriglazov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead, basketball is the United States-Australia.
By the way, I can't say anything bad about this decision.
The Australians were on an equal footing, the first half won altogether.
Put in the place of Americans who were faked from their own greatness.
As a result, they still lost, but, as they say, the basketball Olympic tournament will no longer be the same.
This is all good, but the fight with Di Franchia is coming, and on the screen without change.
In a slight panic, I begin to flip channels.
It feels like it's a second time in a row.
All right, let's go deep, on the cables.
There is no fencing on any of the thematic "Match".
And, in my opinion, the fight is about to begin.
Text and tweets of some sports sites do not suit me.
Conjugment surfing gives an unexpected but brilliant result.
On the website of the "First", it turns out, there is a direct technical broadcast of all competitions that take place at this point in time.
I click on fencing, I get a fight for gold.
Deriglazova counterattacks perfectly, goes ahead on glasses - and quite obviously begins to delay time.
The Italian wins almost the entire gap.
Our one point ahead, to the end a little more than two seconds.
Dee Franceska rushes to Deriglazova, she retreats, time ends, the Italian puts an injection.
Victory!
After a few seconds, the Olympic messenger on the phone reports the fourth gold medal.
I'm the first person to see it with my own eyes.
Insane, faithful, involved.
The Spiritual Administration of Muslims (DUM) of Tatarstan refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma obliged its imams to conduct Friday sermons only in Tatars to force the young Tatars to “study their native language”.
The department says that this “in no case infringes” the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques, Kazan complain that the Tatar language is not understood by up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and the Tatars themselves.
The imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience."
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As stated by the mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin, this should be an incentive for young Tatars “to learn their native language.”
“For those who say that it is “heavy”, in every large mosque we intend to organize the lessons of the Tatar language absolutely free of charge,” said Simigullin.
He added that “the decision has already come into force” and today in all mosques preaching “should be already in the Tatar language.”
He recalled that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Shura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
The imam, who does not speak Tatar well enough, “can be thoroughly prepared for them.”
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, Friday's sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used mainly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev mosque, Zakabannoy and Enyer.
However, Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, the leadership sets the task that all students have the knowledge of both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any infringement of non-tatar Muslims," Mr. Mukhametshin stressed, explaining that the sermon itself "is not obligatory, the main part of the prayer."
At the same time, the prayer itself will continue to be read in Arabic, lectures and lessons in Russian will be preserved in mosques.
At the same time, Rafik Mukhametshin told Kommersant that there was no serious threat of ousting the Tatar language from mosques.
In addition to Russian and Tatar other languages, for example, Uzbek or Tajik, according to him, are not used in sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported by the Executive Committee of the World Congress of Tatars (CGT).
The head of the executive committee of the CCP Rinat Zakirov told Kommersant: "The Mosques are an important part of our national life."
It would be sad if the Tatar language had left this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of sermons only in the Tatar language "the desire of the imams themselves", but the executive committee of the CGT "consider it right."
The imams interviewed by Kommersant, who preached in Russian, are ready to fulfill the decision of the Duma, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties with the understanding of the clergy.
Both Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don’t understand the language.
Of course, it will be exubiding.
"We will have to rebuild," says the imam of the Burnaev Mosque Farhat Mavletdinov.
According to him, preaching in the Russian language is closer to even many Tatars, since "Russian in schools, and in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere initially."
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue lessons and lectures in Russian, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
Allah will show a way out of this situation,” he concluded.
But about 60% of us do not know the Tatar language.
These are Uzbeks, and Tajiks, and Azerbaijanis.
There are a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
“Therefore, we have been switching to Russian for four years,” the imam says.
He believes that in the Tatar language, sermons will “reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience.”
But we will obey the decision of the plenum.
The result of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
“For example, it will only be easier for me, because the Tatar language is my native language,” concluded Gabdullah Galiullin.

Egor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas only for domestic films.
“I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than on foreign films,” he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that it is difficult for Russian films to compete for the viewer with large Hollywood films.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made per year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reaches screens.
“And even they find it very difficult to compete with “Transformers” and “Iron Man”, in the promotion of which huge budgets are pumped,” the film director said.
Recall that on July 1, the All-Russian Youth Educational Forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea.
Among the participants are teachers of creative professions and young professionals of various creative and humanitarian fields from all over Russia and a number of countries of near and far abroad.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region) detained the lawyer of the former Vice-Governor Nikolai Sandakov Konstantin Akulich.
As another lawyer of the accused - Sergei Kolosovsky, told Kommersant-South Ural, Konstantin Akuliz today was summoned to the investigative department of the Miess to bring charges in the case of a year ago about beatings.
Then Konstantin Akulic went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
“Initially, it was initiated against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akulic,” Sergei Kolosovsky believes.
Konstantin Akulic became the lawyer of the ex-deputy governor in early August.

The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK took up the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally “dirty” enterprises of the country – the Karabash copper smelter plant.
The Karabash copper smelter was founded by the English Joint Stock Company, led by Leslie Urquhart in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was a significant industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the vital activity of the whole city.
However, in the 1990-ies due to financial problems, production was stopped, which entailed serious social problems in Karabash.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabash copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabash plant - environmental.
By the early 2000's, Karabash was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the company came under the control of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize production, which began to gradually reduce the environmental burden on the environment.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabashmed in the first days of July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the changes that have occurred with the enterprise since Karabashmed moved to the RMK group.
The main measure for the modernization of "Karabashmedi" in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid shop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the President of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the volume of investments in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of CJSC "Karabashmed" - reconstruction of the convertible rework.
The replacement of three converters, dust holders, gas tract is scheduled for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment workshop worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amounts of taxes deducted to the budget of the city of Karabash will also grow.
For the entire period of the project of the Tominsky GOK project - from the beginning of construction and before commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of the GOK, the receipt of taxes to the budgets of all levels may reach 80.9 billion rubles.
For the year of production in the Varna district, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to the budgets of different levels.
And that's in the first year.

However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of their presence is not limited to tax deductions.
RMK enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve the territories.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabash was a major overhaul, and in fact - almost complete restructuring of the kindergarten N9 by 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in an emergency condition.
Also on the territory of the "RMK Arena" will be located a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
RMK Arena will allow to hold spectacular professional sports events of international level.

WSJ: the United States is considering the introduction of sanctions against Russia due to the hacking of the servers of the Democrats.
US officials are considering the introduction of new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of the servers of the Democratic party, writes The Wall Street Journal, citing sources.
Reportedly, for the imposition of sanctions, the administration of US President Barack Obama will have to officially blame the attack on servers of Russia or the hackers supported by the Russian authorities.
According to sources, the FBI and other American intelligence agencies are almost confident in Russia’s involvement in a cyber attack.
The WSJ notes that the US usually prefers not to indicate by name those who carry out hacker attacks.
The exception is the hacking of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, the responsibility for which was officially assigned to the DPRK.
Last year, however, Obama issued a decree simplifying the imposition of sanctions on those who carry out or facilitate cyber attacks.
Initially, it was directed against China, but can be used against other countries.
The process of making a decision on sanctions can be long, the newspaper writes.
Even if officials came to the conclusion that the hackers acted with the support of Russia, before making a decision on the disclosure of information, they will have to weigh the possible consequences.
They have to determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions in bilateral relations because of it.
Earlier it was reported that the administration of Barack Obama allows the possibility of applying sanctions against the state, whose hackers hacked the servers of the national Committee of the Democratic party.
WikiLeaks has published e-mails of the Democratic National Committee.
The media reported that hackers working with the Russian authorities may be involved in the hack.
In the Kremlin, such reports were called absurd.

Snapchat's Anime Effect Criticized as an Asian Cartoon
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by the anime, but some observers say it is racially non-tacted.
With the help of the Linza tool, Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, dog or character to stand up for the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are rough, curved features tools that create more than 30 million corrected selfies per day.
Any mistakes quickly become well-known.
Snapchat lingacies have been criticized in the past when they were accused of promoting dark face skin or encouraged bleached faces as an ideal of beauty.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them oblique eyes, crooked teeth and choke cheeks, some critics found it a racist caricature of Asians – “yellow-faced”.
And they wondered whether these recurring contradictions point to a more serious problem of the company related to diversity.
On Wednesday, messages spread and indignation in reports on The Verge and Motherboard spread, the day after Snapchat said they had removed the feature.
The company commented: the lens was conceived as reverence for the characters of the anime, and not as a caricature of Asians.
But experts who know about racism firsthand, the lens reminded offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison with the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about photographs were actively shared, said the lens was “offensive and at least awkward.”
She added that “it’s a tough debate with a comparison of the side by side of a very rough caricature of Asians and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-faced, but highly pejoratively yellow-faced.
Snapchat is not the only company going through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems involved in the endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, ranging from corporate conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all carry with us.
And the huge audience of young people in Snapchat – who are more racially diverse than their older generation – may mean that they are more likely to wait for understanding.
When one of the lenses Snapchat creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, 25-year-old Katie Jou said in an interview on Thursday, “it is much more difficult to go unnoticed as it was before.”
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and an engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her account on Snapchat and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a telephone interview, she said she believed that racial contradictions are the cause of insufficient diversity when recruiting footage in Snepchat.
Zhu criticized mainly the white management of the company, consisting only of men and ended his article with a hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhou wrote, who is herself an American of Chinese descent: “Either they didn’t have enough non-white people in the state who could make such decisions, or they have unwhite people, but they do not hold positions that can be safely and openly spoken out.”
Other observers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction with the fact that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its staff, underssensing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of its staff, but according to a confidant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and on active attempts to involve internal resources.
For her part, he said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, “I wonder if they really need more users like us so they can say that it won’t work.”
Military leadership distorted intelligence about ISIS, congressional commission reports
Officials from the U.S. Central Command have amended intelligence reports to provide a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the ground-based event gives, a congressional commission said in a report released Thursday.
The interim report of the task force established by the Republican Chairman of the House Committee for the Armed Forces, the Intelligence Committee and the Sub-Committee on Military Aspects found “widely widespread discontent” among analysts of the Central Command intelligence service, who argue that the leaders corrected their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
The central command, known as Centcom, is the main military department in Tampa, Florida, which controls U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
“The intelligence documents approved by the top command of the Centcom, as a rule, gave a more optimistic image of U.S. anti-terrorist actions than confirmed by real data from the scene, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence agencies,” the report said.
“What happened in Centcom is unacceptable: when the top leadership is unreliable analysis, our military suffers,” said House member Ken Culvert, a California Republican.
Problems with the management in the Centcom reach the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the shortcomings that have arisen in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of American actions aimed at training the armed forces of Iraq provided by the Central Command.
While it does not contain definitive evidence that members of the Obama administration ordered the falsification of the reports, he argues that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership forced them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were much more optimistic than the real events,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at the return of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“After months of investigation, this is known for sure,” House member Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top leadership of the US Central Command intelligence service counterfeited intelligence documents of the command to downplay the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed an operational group when they learned that analysts expressed concern that intelligence about the Islamic State had been falsified.
As the investigation advances, the report released on Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
An additional, not completed at the moment, the investigation of the intelligence of the Centcoms is carried out by the chief inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Representatives of the Democratic Party in the House Intelligence Committee of the U.S. Congress published their own data on Thursday, which will be consistent with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an overtundect procedure for the production of intelligence assessments on ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, Chief Representative of the Democratic Party in the Committee.
This procedure, according to Schiff, “stalled the release of intelligence documents”, caused damage to the morale of analysts and “does not reflect divergent views enough.”
But Schiff and Democrats claim that they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Centcom analysts to fit their sentences under a “tached or political interpretation.”
Preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were presented on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon chief inspector, opened after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Lieutenant Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the chief inspector’s investigation continues.
“Experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these vital issues related to national security.”
The consequences of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the American-made bombing in Iraq and Syria achieves the target (as more and more representatives of the Ministry of Defense now claim).
But last year’s statements cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Command provides true assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of the Islamic State intelligence looms over a decade ago when Centcom Intelligence Analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article claiming that the administration of President George Walker Bush over the protest of many analysts has come out in support of a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think that would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest caused by intelligence officials on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, Hooker’s team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not lead to a significant deterioration in the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not distributed outside the Central Command, the Times newspaper reported in September.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III was criticized last year after testimonies in the Senate, which many MPs considered an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by the General Command. Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins 4 times in a row in women's field hockey, thereby approaching the decisive fight with Britain
Scored once three goals in the match, which ended with a victory over Japan with a score of 6-1, Katie Bam opened the score on Thursday the first two goals for the US team in women's field hockey, when the Americans defeated the team of India with a score of 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bam, 27, says she doesn’t be sure if she would have done anything like that.
“I won’t put it,” she said.
I’m not really the kind of people who track their goals.
Here’s what she knows: the score of the Americans is 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they compete for first place in their group with Britain, which remains invincible after losing to Japan with a score of 2-0 on Thursday.
The teams of Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Both teams claim the quarter-finals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams, and who - the second.
The winner will avoid meeting a strong team of rivals from Holland, the leaders of another group, a little more, when the quarterfinals will begin.
However, Saturday’s game shows that the Americans here made a noise in their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first took a gob funglock for her first when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played this sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at the age of 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she did not pass the qualifying round to the final squad.
Then came 2012, when everything did not work out for her and her teammates.
The following year, Coig Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed coach, and everything began to change.
“Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical fitness,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the kind of productivity that we have now.
We completely changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Bam opened the score in the first half of the game with a throw from an uncomfortable hand at a short distance.
India approached the game without a single victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the score of 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative in its hands.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiraled into the middle and sharply sent the ball into the goal, thereby giving the Americans an advantage of 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The victory “dry” was the first in the tournament for US goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of the first three victories.
She's in a blow.
So is Bam.
“We’re in a good position right now,” Parnham said, but how good it depends on the outcome of Saturday’s game.
In the midst of the frenzy of the Olympic Games - "Zen" jumping on the trampoline
Wherever you are, no matter how much time it is, it’s the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem immutable and inevitable, it is a frantic combination of competition and aspiration.
Like the Olympic flame itself is the burning torch that is transmitted from the archer to swimmer, to gymnastics, to the triathlete.
You can’t turn on a TV, read a newspaper, or overhear a conversation of your neighbors in turn at the cafe and not hear about Simone Bils, Katie Ledecki or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who plays for the first time in the Olympics, is handsome with dummy on the cheeks, could well be among those celebrities who are shown in prime time, who are promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fagger.
But 28-year-old Dooley from the city of Lake Forest in California is fighting for gold in the Olympic competitions in the trampoline jumping.
The Olympic flame does not cover all events the same way.
Then from the center, partly in the shadows, are those sports that are not universally recognized: shooting from a pneumatic pistol, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, a long reign for him.
But if I am allowed to speak timidly in defense of my personal addiction, allow you to pay attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampoline jump has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they made their debut at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years they have received so little recognition that many people I interviewed have not been aware that they are generally one of the Olympic sports.
It can be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in the trampoline jump, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians, as a rule, share male awards, and the Chinese and Canadians - women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie McLennan of Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumps have an outsider charm, especially because for an unenlightened ear is more associated with a circus college than with the Olympic Games.
Here I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They really have a comic potential – this is a caricature of endless jumps – but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports, which they basically combine in themselves.
The word "trap" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", meaning "a springboard for diving".
Candidates to win jump on a giant trampoline, taking off nearly 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and flips) before the final landing on his feet.
They are evaluated by the performance, complexity and “time of flight”, according to the official program of the Olympic Games.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is to go.
Candidates for the medal should go further, faster, higher and higher in pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth.
They strive not only for the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in front of the TV cameras, to another teasing milestone: the world or Olympic record.
This stubborn desire is noble, worthy of admiration, even fanatical - and it is enough to make even the viewer cry.
But it, in my opinion, is a little boring when watching the Games.
From him jumps on a trampoline give a respite.
The trampoline direction is up.
Moving forward is not a goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And in them, of course, it is not without competition or difficulties, but throughout the program there is no insane zeal to finish, there are no long jumps, only a marvelous, graceful disappearance of time and gravity.
This is the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
Women's qualifying competitions, and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast per hour of the day in Eastern European time; men's - on Saturday, also at the hour.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the day program starting from 14:00 on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment is expected, which can be easily overlooked in a common landfill.
And if the growth of consciousness can only be achieved by exposing male athletes to covetous guises and objectification – as, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently suggested by male gimnes from the United States – Dooli is only waiting for his new admirable crowd of fans.
“Generation Protests” in Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Furious protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of schism?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a firm ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country, spreading to an increasing number of its territories.
Over the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets, demanding radical political change.
According to human rights defenders, the government’s response was fierce.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot down dozens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video footage from the protests, allegedly shot at the end of last year or earlier this year, shows how security officers beat young people with sticks when they were put on their hands against the wall.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country from disintegrating, and it will continue to be even more difficult,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Africa Horn project in an international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second densely populated country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia is developing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets, as a rule, quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy – human rights organizations are constantly mentioned about government repressions – the opposition on the territory of the state was suppressed, due to the fact that dissidents were actually silenced.
Many of them were exiled, imprisoned, murdered or driven into remote deserts.
But that can change.
“If people are constantly suppressed and left by options but to protest, an uprising will rise,” said Seyum Teshomet, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
Complaints are numerous, ranging from land use, ending with the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After the widely criticized elections last year, the government party and its allies completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are growing; the struggle for this uncertain, disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use unrest and rearrangement.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings, a few years boiling in the depths of the soul, flare up now.
The first, it would seem, is completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years, a large number of Ethiopians were able to communicate on social networks, as cheap smartphones have become commonplace, and the Internet service has become better.
Even when the government shuts down access to Facebook and Twitter, as often happens, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through the proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized for the protests.
The second, that there is more solidarity between Oromo and Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oroma and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amhara, of Ethiopia’s predominantly Christian highlands, flourished in politics and business, exploiting Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
“We will act together under a single principle,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of Oromo.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade and politics.
The third cause of the excitement is the loss of Meles Zenaui.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years, until his death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say that he especially skillfully recognized the first signals of discontent and used scouts to obtain data and neutralize opponents.
“The current regime lacks common sense,” Abdi, an analyst of conflict situations, said.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalein, appeared nowhere and took the place of Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was originally from the Tigray region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is a southerner.
Analysts say he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by Tigray.
Many fear that as a result, this will lead to even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be the elections that the government has frozen and then faked the results.
In the ensuing repressions, many Protestants were killed, albeit in less than the last months, and this period of unrest has gone relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed appreciation for Ethiopia ' s leaders for the vision of infrastructure, such as the new long-distance train and significant successes in the fight against poverty.
But it is clear that this did not stop the growth of internal discontent by the Ethiopian government.
It takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhar, attacked Tigray-owned enterprises, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media became comprehensive.
Analysts say the protesters put the United States and other Western allies in an uncomfortable position.
The U.S. government used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced it had closed the base.
On the one hand, it is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, he does not want his ally to lose strength in an already unstable region.
“And it will be difficult to pass on this stretched rope,” Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to hush up the latest conflict that engulfed his campaign on Friday, arguing that he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of the presidential candidate from the Republican Party to make intelligiously addressed the American people.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the period of unrest, in an awkward position, since they had to explain the statements he probably did not mean.
Expressing this assumption at a congress on Wednesday evening, Trump strongly insisted on his approval on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a Twitter post early on Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just a sneering.
This post was the direct opposite of the claim made just a day earlier, when Trump said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the statement, reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not take the opportunity.
The last scandal broke out when Trump tried to reorient his campaign to the economy against the backdrop of a downgrade.
Trump and Clinton made competing speeches about the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump again tried to return to the topic.
Once again, by resorting to Twitter, he warned Clinton’s plans to lead to tax increases, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has previously used sarcasm as an excuse.
At the end of July, after he had put on his general criticism, almost expressing the idea that the Russians should hack into Clinton’s email, he later explained his remarks, saying, “Of course, I’m joking.”
This approach allows Trump to go beyond the permissible political speech and take his words back if necessary.
“I think it’s his way of testing certain messages that responds among his fans to watch them act and then ‘explain’ it in one direction or another, depending on the reaction,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is careful in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to interpret them in different ways.
Instead of softening the remarks for the broad electorate, Trump has taken an even more sarcastic tone in recent days, while his rating continues to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist’s rating, released on Friday, revealed that Trump is second to Clinton by a great margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and goes with her on par with Florida.
While Trump tends to try not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But since Trump has become the subject of increased attention in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position: they have to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his statements were.
W. W. Rudolph Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City, who is one of Trump’s most famous deputies, made a serious effort to protect the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is an acceptable political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about Trump’s credibility that Obama and Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
It is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown small organization, he called it not a threat, absolutely unfair, and that’s why it all happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq.
Most of the average Republicans claim that the Obama administration, in which Clinton held the post of Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to develop, as it could not reassure the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to Twitter attack the media for the unbundling of his words and bias towards him.
He mocked the "poor unfortunate" television experts who are trying to solve it, and said: "They are weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump’s excuses as further confirmation that he’s not fit for president.
Once forced coffee shop returns to GreenPoint
The Werb coffee shop was a ragged, receiving only cash in Williamsburg, which did not have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of its room with a showcase on Bedford Avenue.
The store "Soupe Sheri", which took the place of "Verb" in the summer of 2014, is engaged in the sale of soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned her as the last loss in a renewing city.
The artist Molly Crabple tweeted: “New York is constantly changing, I know, but still I can’t believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea’s hotel is destroyed, and the Werb has now become a soap store.”
But at least New York is constantly changing, it, in turn, is being updated.
The revived Verb coffee shop opened last November to GreenPoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
In the new "Verbe" there is Wi-Fi and accept credit cards, but there are some of the same employees and a similar simple atmosphere.
Coffee is still good.
At the head of the new "Verba" is Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of an old coffee shop, who is the owner and general manager in a new place.
He started working at Verb in 2001 and was there until the very end.
When one of the clients offered to sponsor it in a new place, he said that he would be happy to go for it.
Rodriguez, who is 36 years old, left a lot in its former form.
"Verb" works with the same distributor of the baglovs and bought the same model of the coffee machine.
It even has chandeliers from the old "Verba".
But Rodriguez said he would also like to experiment.
He offered new dishes.
The menu presents sandwiches with bacon, egg and cheese, and there are cups of capers or fried onions.
There are dishes from brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now they make freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he drew attention to the constant flow of old regular customers.
“Many former clients were also squeezed out by prices from Williamsberg,” he said.
On one of the recent Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who is 34, used to live in Williamsburg and often visited the Werb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she went there anyway.
After the closure of the Verba, she said that she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
“I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Verb,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, although on that day, instead of the usual ice coffee, she ordered a blended tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been faithfully visiting the Werb since 2003.
He went in front of the work and ordered the same thing in every veinary.
“At fifteen minutes eighth, every day, as in the hour, I came, and for me prepared my bigl with butter and with all the fillings,” he said.
Rodriguez said that he wanted to experiment and introduced new dishes to the menu.
Today Rosenthal still makes a regular order, but someday he will change something with bacon, egg or cheese on the bagel with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said that he was not offended that the soap shop once took possession of the old place.
Moreover, the owners of "Suppe Sheri" offered to make a special soap for "Verba", using coffee coffee, prepared in a cold way, as an ingredient.
“I think we may agree to their proposal,” Rodriguez said.
Permanent residents of GreenPoint of Polish origin also chose this coffee shop.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the showcase so that his new neighbors felt desirable.
The new place has other benefits.
A local point for the sale of juices plans to pour bottles and sell coffee prepared in a cold way.
There is a possibility that the coffee shop will join the next building.
For many customers, it is enough that the new "Verb" will include in the menu their favorite dishes.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and shared that he was gratified when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened in a new place, Witt said that by entering and ordering a cup of coffee, he felt as if he had returned home.
“How long I’ve wanted to feel this fragrance,” he said.
Depression Depression in "Dard Treasure"
In March 1933, shortly after the assumption of president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to dine in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable dishes of Fifth Avenue, such as foie gras and the merry turtle soup.
His menu on this day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert - pudding made of prunes.
“It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who suffered,” said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat."
Spouses living in Brooklyn Heights are food history experts.
Cowa's latest book, "The Chevy's Rice", was dedicated to Chinese cuisine in America, and Zieguelman told the story of life in a rented apartment in Lower East Side through the food in her book "House 97 on Fruit Garden Street".
Their new joint work “Dardy Meal”, which will be published on Tuesday by Harper – is the story of American food in the Great Depression.
Showing their own culinary solidarity to some extent, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny simple diner in the Flatyron Quarter, which has been operating since 1929, the year of Stock Bloom.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with pieces of olives, and Coe, 57, took turkey, mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered a meat roll, the couple considered it a suitable starting point for a discussion about food in the Depression era.
“The rolls were in great demand,” Siegelman said.
There was a peanut roll, a hepatic roll, a bean roll.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap foods that allowed stretching the ingredient.
Imagine that you ate as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe's wrinkling.
“He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone,” he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in the countryside, was a buffet.
Groups of women were prepared for male farm workers, and a freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. The “dense meal” describes how the country coped with the fact that suddenly ceased to be a country of abundance.
“It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans,” Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The same difficult was the new budget diet: mysterious dishes, such as rolls and cassocks, became the staple food; the casserole is "a great way to dispose of the scuba diverges", - said Ziegelman, - because the chefs could hide inappetous ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced by cheaper dried fruits.
Meat, which for many years was the basis of American food, has become a spat rather distributed luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
Enrolling in research for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of that era: baked onions stuffed with peanut butter.
“This addition to the dining table was not successful,” Coe said.
Ziegelman added: “It was very strange.”
Peanut butter does not fit baked onions at all.
This has been typical of many homemade recipes.
As never before and never since then, home economics specialists — including Louise Stanley, the head of the federal Household of Housekeeping from 1923 to 1943 — managed the country’s food habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become “budget maker”, to take on a challenge and transform a burda like rubbed with carrots into delicious dishes.
“Dense meal” is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially spicy stories about the government’s reaction to starving citizens, for example, the position of President Herbert Hoover in the spirit of “eat eat pies.”
Publicly, a simple farmer's clutch of Iowa during his childhood, he ate as a refined millionaire that he became.
“He liked continental cuisine, for example, a fish with cucumber sauce,” Coe said.
He ate almost in a gilded dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
It was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not advised him to set an example for his own stomach.
As described in the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in taste at all, and this led to the fact that the White House “used not only the most dull food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked.”
Many of the culinary techniques of the Depression era were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and how science was used in cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book, they better understood the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother – that she could not throw away food, for example.
“She was seriously afraid of having a rapproof attitude to food,” Coe said.
Siegelman recalls: "She poisoned people seriously."
There was one unpleasant case with the antiplatelets.
When the plates in Eisenberg's were empty, they and Coe pulled out a dessert that he prepared at home: a dessert of prunes, which President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called mousse of prunes," Ziegelman said, adding that it was a common technique - giving modest recipes catchy names.
There were no whipped cream, only prunes, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly immersed the spoon in viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Cow asked for supplements twice.
With the voice of the confident compiler of the budget, he told his wife: “A little chopped walnuts would not hurt here.”
The arrest of the defendants in the case of a mass brawl at the Khovanskoye cemetery was extended until November 14
Presnensky court left until November 14 under the arrest of the defendants in the case of a mass brawl at the Khovansky cemetery, satisfying the corresponding request of the investigation.
There are 14 people in the case of the accused.
Recall that on May 14, a mass brawl of several hundred immigrants from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons took place at the Khovans cemetery, which killed three people.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization “Healthy Nation” Alexander Bocharnikov charged with organizing the murder.
The question of the second year of the year 2016 indexation of pensions can be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Olga Golodets during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have specific parameters, how much it is necessary to increase the pension in order to reduce the inflation that exists in the country.
All calculations are made.
Now economists are summing up the results of the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks," Golodets was quoted as saying by Interfax.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Research Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age for six months every year, the Deputy Prime Minister said that the Cabinet of Ministers does not consider this topic.
At the end of July it became known that the Government agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.

Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gulen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
“I demand that an independent international commission investigate the attempted coup d’état,” Gulen was quoted as saying by the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also said that "if any part of the accusations is confirmed, I will return to Turkey."
However, Gülen strongly denies involvement in the coup d’etat, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The court of Istanbul earlier in absentia arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen.
Recall that the attempted military coup occurred in Turkey on the night of July 15-16.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of lawyer services during a patent dispute from hepatitis C with Merck
Gilead Sciences Inc has the right to receive reimbursement for the costs of lawyer services, which it has suffered in connection with the lawsuit on the patent for a hepatitis C drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc, the federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was exempted from $200 million in damages for violating Merck’s two patents related to Gilead’s drugs, sales leaders, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a U.S. judge found a number of violations by Merck, including falsehood and other unethical acts.
When a U.S. federal district court judge Beth Labson, Freeman, said Gilead was entitled to reimbursement for the costs incurred in the contest.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other, claiming their rights to the laboratory work underlying the sofosbuvir, the active ingredient of Gilead drugs.
U.S.-backed Armed Forces Acknowlingating Full Control of Manbij from Islamic State
U.S.-backed armed forces seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after serving the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They released more than 2 000 civilian hostages, which were held by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the Manbij military council told Reuters.
“The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting clean-up operations,” he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $ 5.3 million in fees for speech, and the former Secretary of State announced an income of $3 million from the publisher Simon & Schuster for her book about her stay in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Holton, has released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set a standard for financial transparency,” Clinton campaign adviser Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In the exact opposite of them, Donald Trump is hiding behind fake excuses and violates his past promises to release his tax returns.
It’s a common matter for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, even though the law doesn’t require them.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers called the inspection of the State Tax Service as the reason for his refusal to publish his tax returns.
“Your move,” Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams tweeted, referring to the Democratic candidate’s declarations.
On Thursday, Trump’s special adviser, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them before the end of the checks.
Critics of Trump, including Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican counterparts, said his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations and other ties, including Russia.
Clinton seized on the issue and on Friday released an online video in which the main place was allocated to outstanding Republicans who urged Trump to publish tax reports.
On Thursday, she raised the issue during a speech about the economy in Michigan.
“He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has been doing without exception for decades: to make public their tax returns,” she told the audience.
The Politico newspaper reported that Trump has not paid any or almost any taxes for two years in the 1990’s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax attorneys and accountants who believe that perhaps things are still the case so far.
The federal tax rates were the subject of a dispute in the presidential election.
Clinton supported the rule named after billionaire, investor Warren Buffett, who would guarantee that people receiving more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, invited Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he was also under IRS’s check, and that Trump was “afraid” not a tax-gathering agency, but voters.
The Clinton campaign released tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, in New York, paid the average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective aggregate tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was the source of wages.
Their main investment was a low-cost index share fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital income of $ 109 000.

Chili and fireworks powder condoms increase the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unconventional way to prevent elephants from wandering into populated places - they throw condoms filled with chili powder.
The method proved to be effective, and the organization of the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with this idea a few years ago, together with the American Committee for Nature Protection, began its promotion, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step way to protect their homes and crops without causing harm to animals.
Previously, many used spears to protect themselves.
Friday will be World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“Since we invented a set of tools ..., we have seen a change in the relationship within these communities, as a result of which they are much more confident that they will be able to keep elephants out of their fields without harming elephants,” Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps consist in lighting the torch in front of the elephant that violated the border and signaling with the help of horns.
If he could not be scared off, then the so-called “Chili cloud” is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a clot in a condom, and its end is twisted, only a wick remains outside.
When igniting, the condom bursts with a rumbling, spraying the fine dust of chili powder in the air.
One breath is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launch device that shoots with Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after an attempted coup in July have not yet returned to Turkey.
Such data was cited by Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in an interview with local journalists.
At the first stage, we withdrew 208 career diplomats so that they would continue to work in the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return without objective reasons and explanations,” the head of the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.
Recall that in July in Turkey there was an attempted coup.
The authorities of the country officially announced that the coup d’etat failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, among them military ranks of senior and middle level.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people were killed, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
Jewish director sharply criticized the Berlin hotel for removing the telephone code of Israel on the “request” of the Arabs – said the channel RT News
A French director of Jewish origin unleashed a media scandal, finding that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have Israel’s phone code list, and employees refer to “requests” by Arab customers.
Claude Lanzman, the author of the Holocaust documentary, Shoa, expressed his dissatisfaction with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to the German media FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of telephone codes provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it happen that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
Written by Lanzman.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity to recruit Israel through its own telephone service center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised this issue at the hotel administration.
The answer he received there, according to Lanzman, “shocked him.”
The hotel’s clerk said the measure was “a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinkski hotel chain.”
The reason behind this step has caused even more anger of the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israel code be removed,” Lanzman, a hotel employee, said.
Israeli Ambassador to Germany Jacob Hadas-Handelsman called the case a “terrible disgrace,” the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung reported.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's actually a terrible disgrace.
The fact that this happened in Germany and it is in this network of hotels is even more disgrace.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” the official said.
The case caused a considerable resonance on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel simply “was about” at the alleged demands of Arab customers.
“Shared,” said in another post, which indicated that the hotel, located on the glorious Kurfurstendamm street, is located next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself hastened to dismiss any charges, calling the incident a “unspectrum” and “apologizing” to Lanzman, according to the newspaper Der Spiegel.
“There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast recruitment list,” a spokesman for the Kemfinski Hotel told Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students protesting
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday, when gathered to protest against government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, as a result of which the police used rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of São Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, almost 100 public secondary schools will be closed, and 300 000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protesters could be seen writing on the walls of graffiti against interim President Michael Temer.
This last protest came just days after protesters took to the streets to support the ousted President Dilma Rousseff as the country’s Senate voted for her impeachment.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71%, according to the portal RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russian Ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there has been an increase in interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are resuming ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhaharyan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5 percent and amounted to $ 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved thanks to the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also predicts that this year Russia will be visited by a record number of Iranian tourists.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35 000 visas, mainly tourist, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran entered the top 20 countries in the number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is safe to say that last year’s record for the number of Iranian tourists who visited Russia will be beaten,” he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which, hopes, the ambassador will change.
“I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yedz, which preserve the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he said.
The state continues to tighten the screws in the military-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the “systematic failure” to the instructions of the General Director of the concern “Almaz-Antey”, “losing in work” and “loss of trust”.
The head of the NGO for the next three years appointed Gennady Bendery.
Information about the dismissal of Neskorodov appeared only on Thursday evening and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
How to explain such silence in the conditions of large-scale rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the leadership of the Russian Federation does not want to spread any rumors or negative assumptions in the public environment.
This once again confirms that the military-industrial complex (GWP) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased attention from society to them.
The removal of Neskordov is undoubtedly an important event in terms of restoring order in the industry.
NPO "Almaz" is the parent company of the concern, which specializes in the production of anti-aircraft missile systems (SAM) of sea and land-based.
Currently, "Diamond" is working on the creation of the Polyment-Redoubt and Morpheus SAM, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the portal Military Russia Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the failure of the terms for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morphean" began in 2007, and commissioning was expected in 2013.
Polyment-Redoubt should become the main air defense system on the latest ships of the Navy.
According to the information I receive, for several years of testing, not a single truly successful test was made.
However, as far as I can judge, there is no unambiguous guilt of Diamond," Kornev said.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning can also occur with the S-500 air defense system.
The development work on the project has not yet been completed, but during 2016 the first complexes should come to the troops.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "work is being carried out planned and everything will be completed on time," although in 2014 the department recognized the presence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who headed Diamond since 2011.
Kornev stated that the disruptions of the terms for projects can be both an occasion and the reason for dismissal.
In his opinion, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to extract information about internal processes in the defense industry and plans for the management of enterprises.
The industry received long-term orders for tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as you know, loves silence.
As a rule, directors of defense companies leave their posts at their own request, under an agreement agreement of the parties or transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension occurred publicly, although it did not receive a resonance.
This suggests that the head of the Diamond was a emetic figure and resisted the “discharge” descent.
Apparently, with such behavior, the state no longer intends to put up.
With the hands of shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to argue with the instructions of the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill the tasks.
At the same time, the leadership of the Russian Federation seeks to punish the accommodating managers (machinations at the shipyard "Zvezda").
The president personally pays higher attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings on rearmament.
The Kremlin is protecting the ranks of defense industry managers, seeking to have a loyal composition of directors at hand, which will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but against the background of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the defense industry, the state does not have other tools.
The current situation in the defense industry, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the “cleansing” of managers in the defense industry, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to improve the professionalism of Russian troops.
The personnel of the army has acquired a new quality with the arrival of Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted a well-known saying “If you want peace, prepare for war.”
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970’s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which enshrined in Moscow’s spheres of influence on the continent.
With all the disadvantages of the bipolar system, it worked quite effectively.
Proof of this was the absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East.
The triumph of the “winners” in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the “civilized world”, perhaps, there is not a single quiet corner left.
Despite the general problem, the West refuses to talk with Russia at the level of an equal partner.
In such circumstances, the only allies of our country remain the navy and the army.
Strengthening military power will allow Moscow to more effectively defend national interests and reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scotsman Callum Skinner rushes on the finish line, as a result of which the British take cycling gold
Scotsman Callum Skinner raced for a triumph in the men's team sprint at a cycling velodrome in Rio last night, as a result of which the British team trio defended his title from London in 2012.
23-year-old native of Glasgow was the role of the strongest, which his fellow Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly entered history, racing in the finish line to snatch the victory from the team-favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed the right to an unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Hoi claimed the rights to the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after they finished modestly sixth at the March World Track Cycle of London, despite Howy from that moment ended his career.
The question between Beijing and London was the replacement of the participant’s specialist Jamie Staff.
They did it because of the time when the Hindes came.
Hoy’s departure also created the void that Kean Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill out.
Skinner was the man who was adhered to by the British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotsman, which was now realized.
Hindes, Kenny - champions with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the standard was surpassed by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won a duel for gold.
Hindes was definitely behind him after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner supported him.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation where Hindes was driving on a larger transfer to slow down and let Kenny and, in particular, Skinner keep pace.
Hoy watched from his place as a visiting BBC expert and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they entered the pedestal.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said, “This is a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world champions.
It was unbelievable.
There is no better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, along with Kenny and Hoya, Hindes declared deliberately to fall on the track after an unsuccessful start.
He later renounced the comment, and there was no way to appeal from UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, “I felt like in London, with all those flags of the UK on the podium.”
We all as a team have met in the last three months.
We lost in so many world-renowned races that winning the Olympics was amazing again.
This is one event, one gold medal for the country that won seven of the 10 names of races both in Beijing and London.
If it is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bike bucket is waiting for another five successful days.
With the form demonstrated by Kenny, it is not beyond the possibility of presenting how he repeats Hoy's feat by winning three Olympic gold medals in the same Game.
This would allow you to see how Kenny – who is exactly exactly 12 years younger than Hoi, who was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a holy date in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Banister) – brings his account to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be like Hoi.
Next time, Kenny competes in a sprint that begins today and plays out for three days.
A 28-year-old Bolton man said, “I’m just enjoying it now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your friends.
It’s a little bit of winning alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, “If he wins two more gold medals, he must get chivalry.”
It was the only medals in the day, but there was good good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Doll are qualified for the fastest four-kilometer team pursuit race.
They finished for 3:51.943.
The world record set for gold winning in London 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will take place today, on the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials demanded that he measure his weight.
In the relevant women's event that resumes and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rousell Shend, Eleanor Barker and Kathy Archibald of Milgawi improved the world record, showing a time of 4:13.260.
The UK has come to the fact that it relies on a powerful team of cyclists to take ownership of the middle period of the Olympic Games and earn a lot of medals.
After in fact, exceptional demonstrations of complete superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have weakened in the gradual preparations for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last - the resignation from the post of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departure of major figures such as Hoi and Victoria Pendelton.
However, based on the first evening race at the velodrome, it seems that the now legendary glory of the UK in reaching the peaks at the right time, perhaps just repeats again.
The future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant under threat due to the termination of the electricity contract
The future of the Portland Aluminum Plant in Victoria – as well as the jobs of hundreds of workers – is under threat due to the fact that the electric power company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant’s owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This step is a consequence of the decision taken earlier this year by the Victorian government, not to renew subsidies provided to support the operation of the plant.
The fixed subsidy for 20 years expires in November.
Up to 2 000 jobs can be at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2 000 jobs – directly and indirectly – can be at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional indirect consequences, as the metallurgical plant consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the metallurgical plant in Point Henry, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power plant last year.
Alcoa’s Portland Metallurgical Plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of reflections on the future of the plant, which have been going on for several years, initially due to the strong positions of the Australian dollar, and later - because of the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies a major aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrob Valley, said it expects the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract.
The controlling stake in the plant belongs to the joint short-term company Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese company Marubeni Corp owns a smaller share.
“AGL expects the Portland facility to continue to operate, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the metallurgical plant will not stop,” she said.
According to AGL, the above-mentioned contracts are so-called “heged contracts” that were supposed to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they will actually end in 2017.
“AGL is still expecting these contracts to bring its share of revenue in the 2017 fiscal year,” the electricity company said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s profits since fiscal 2018 has been limited to forecasts for a strong futures market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in view of the “perhaps of the escapation.”
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts “does not affect the ability of Alcoa to manage the metallurgical plant or to ensure the supply of electricity to the metallurgical plant.”
The American company said it had signed a twenty-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was supposed to enter into force in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Metallurgical Plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Addressing analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy every year, and Tomago is about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand in the market [of electricity].
For us, as a manufacturer, it will be bad,” he said.
Not only the star of the reality show Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner mother-manager Chris, appeared on the coveted September cover of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and defileded on fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on Instagram on Thursday.
“Being in the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried,” Kendall wrote.
The news of the cover was accompanied by a strange (or just in the spirit of the “Family of the Kardashians”?), prepared by reality-video, in which the whole family of Kardashian-Jenner (debacles Rob and Caitlin, also joined them as the most common favorite uncle of show business, producer of “Kardashyan Family” Ryan Siecros), forgot about the appearance of the sister..
This is the standard storyline of almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to the birthday (Crossey says the phrase: "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the program at 8 a.m.), but Chris was needed to make this fame in one way or another for other girls.
Because with this episode dedicated to the September Vogue issue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
Let the older sister Kendall Kim got on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
September is the best-selling Vogue release of the year.
Thickness similar rather to a gift publication than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page issue contained advertising).
News of which of the stars will get on his cover is expected to be so eager that in the last two years, photos of the magazine merged before the official announcement.
Previous few women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more “celemen that work as models” than “models that are celebrities.”
The winner of the award "Oscar" and the face of the brand Dior Jennifer Lawrence was presented on the cover in 2013, a year after this honor fell Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, whom the magazine described as an “outstanding model” of his generation, falls into the first category, it is in a good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality show stars or modern children who know how to make a good video in Snapchat (although Jenner gets into all these categories).
These are really talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, which appeared on last year’s cover, this year was one of the most successful in her career in connection with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
The position of Jenner in the fashion world, due to her previous TV reality TV star, should have always remained shaky.
In June, one of the first Victoria’s Secret models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them “tryches of the moment.”
These sentiments again murmured after the news about the appearance of Jenner on the cover of Vogue.
But it makes no sense to dwell on discontent.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of Vogue's September.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
It defiles for Mark Jacobs.
It sells you tone cream from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos in their own applications, available on a paid subscription.
She sells his own photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her free time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she participates in a reality show on television.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160 000 people per year
Each year, more than 160 000 least protected representatives of the population refuse to serve in public legal centers, as this sector is preparing for an effect that will have further reduction of funding by and already being carried out at the limit of opportunity.
In Queensland, three out of five people — mostly the elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who are unable to combat unfair property deprivation and so on – have already been refused, trying to get free legal assistance and representation.
Public legal services already working outside of opportunity are preparing for further reductions.
From June next year, these legal centers should lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, director of Queensland’s Public Law Centers, said that according to the latest census report of the National Association of Public Law Centers, thousands of people a year are refuted.
Farrell said that if the federal government’s decision is not annulled, the situation will only worsen.
“Queensland’s public legal centers are constantly getting insufficient funding: this means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People leaving the violent relationship, people with unmanaged and ruined debts, families passing through divorce, unjustly fired workers – all these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, which means that thousands of less protected residents of Queensland will be forced to solve complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Senator George Brandis to immediately annul these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise the financing of free legal aid to the national average.
Now is the time to pay attention to the needs of public legal centers and communities, their clients, and it is time for the government of Palashchuk to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump’s campaign went on to court after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump’s campaign was sued: the headquarters allegedly did nothing after a report that his North Carolina chief was threatening a pistol to an employee while they were driving a Jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in a state court in Charlotte by Vincent Borgandy, a former software instructor at the state’s campaign headquarters.
Bullidhi said he waited for several months to solve the problem in the internal order, but realized that “it will not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip “removed the gun, put his right index finger on the trigger and pointed a blow to Vincent’s kneecap,” says Bordindi in a complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional office of the campaign headquarters, Bordiny realized that at least four more people had become participants in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal claims.
“Pistols don’t have to shoot to damage,” Bordindi said in a complaint.
The lawsuit took place just two days after the Republican presidential candidate made a splash, telling North Carolina listeners that the “people of the Second Amendment” – understood as the owners of the weapon and his amateurs – could begin to act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and able to choose the judges.
The Trump campaign said the media had pulled his words out of context and that he had not spoken out of support for the violence.
In his complaint, Bordiny demands compensation from the campaign headquarters for neglican control, and Phillip demands compensation for the threat of physical violence, insulting the action and causing moral damage.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is delayed in response to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one quickly called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has conducted a controversial campaign.
Case: Bulliories vs Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, Division of the Supreme Court of Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain should direct the Olympic spirit to the right direction and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only in our local settlements and throughout London, but throughout the country.
As for me, this was exactly the huge advantage of Heathrow, just as it was with London 2012, where we made every effort to ensure that our peoples and regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympic Games have been very useful for Stratford and the East End.
And we will do so again, creating opportunities for local residents and firms near Heathrow.
Only for our local settlements alone, we will create 10 000 new internships, 40 000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as London 2012 was before, there will be those who think that the task of expanding Heathrow is too large.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympic Games, and that we would be in a predicament on the world stage.
Skeptics were mistaken in 2012, and they will be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question asked about it.
Like the Heathrow Olympics, it’s an infrastructure project for most, not just a narrow circle.
The expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, 211 billion pounds of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a great team in Heathrow, which has implemented the program of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investments in a timely manner and within the budget, from T5 - chosen by the best terminal of the airport for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the two most occupied runways in the world.
Now they are ready to provide a third runway, confirmed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for the UK, and I am confident that the Heathrow enlarge will be too.
It is time for us to direct the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, ensuring our trade future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton, Chairman of the Heathrow Council and the former Trade Attache of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook play "cat-mouse" on the issue of blocking ads
For companies that make money on online advertising, attempts to bypass the software to block advertising are a game of “cat-mouse”, according to one of the companies that creates such software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus published a blog post that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that the desktop version of the site will change the layout around its ads to make it more difficult for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now says it has been able to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “such a kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad community and those trying to bypass it continues from the moment of the invention of the ad blocking,” and it is possible that Facebook will present its own solution in the near future.
The fact that the world’s largest social network has entered the fight is a clear sign of how big a problem has become ad blockers for the industry.
Worldwide, about 200 million people use ad blockers, according to last year’s Pagefair and Adobe study; almost four times the number of those who used such software in 2013.
Given the 1.3 billion daily active users who access Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in mobile applications Facebook for the social network and Instagram, according to the representative.
But still, advertising in the desktop version is a fairly profitable article for Facebook to consider such a step a profitable investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its “advertising preferences” tool to give people more control over how advertising is targeting.
Facebook said on Thursday that Adblock’s new filters are worrisome, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
“This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Advertising lockers are a rough tool, so we instead focused on creating tools like Advertising Preferences to transfer control to people’s hands.
The woman moved on the Swiss highway in an episode of obvious suicide
The victim was on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are urging witnesses after a woman moved several vehicles on a highway early Thursday morning in a clear suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on A1 near the Walg in the canton of V shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay down on the road in the dark “in a gesture of desperation” and she was hit by several vehicles, Police said in a statement.
Clearly trying to kill herself, the victim, a Swiss woman at the age of 49, hit several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
A few involved drivers have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, police said, who is calling on them and anyone else witnessing the incident to respond.
A criminal case was opened, a “logical” step in such a situation, said lawyer Gillet Hofsterter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid a blow?
That’s what the prosecutor has to define,” Hofstight said.
Two other similar cases over the past five years suggest that drivers will not be recognized as responsible.
In each case – both of which involve a person walking in the dark on the highway – was sentenced that motorists could not expect an accidental meeting with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she hitting and killing a man lying on the A1 near Payern at night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim drank and lost consciousness on the road, heard the court.
The court found that a policewoman — who responded to an emergency call — drove the vehicle in a way that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Someone who has information about the incident on Thursday near the Walrus is due to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's Climate Model: Venus Was Once Inhabited
Venus may have been habitable, according to estimates of the new NASA climate model.
Scientists from the Nasov Institute for the Study of Goddard’s Space Developed a Model to Study the Past Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climatologists.
The model was designed to determine whether on Venus, with its hot waterless surface and an atmosphere oversaturated with carbon dioxide, could ever exist conditions like Earth.
Scientists previously assumed that the low speed of rotation of Venus is explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the last simulation suggests that Venus could probably have a rarefied atmosphere like an earth, and still rotate slowly.
The model also looked at the topography of early Venus.
There were more drylands on the planet than on Earth, but once there was enough water and enough geographical variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited the sun, which was 30 percent dim.
“According to the GISS model, Venus’ slow rotation is setting its dayside to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a print message.
This warms the surface of the planet and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds acting as an umbrella protecting the planet’s surface from a substantial portion of solar heat.
The result is average climatic temperatures, which, surprisingly, are slightly cooler than these days on Earth.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the development that was previously assumed by experts in the study of planets.
Despite the fact that once Venus may have been habitable, it has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen evaporated, only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect remained – that is, Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy leaves the post of coach of the team Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned as coach and vice president of hockey activities Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the decision-making process in the team.
Executive Vice President / Chief Executive Officer of the Colorado team Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will begin to look for a new coach immediately.
“Over the past three years, I have served my head coach and vice president of hockey activities Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination,” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
During the summer, I thought for a long and hard time on how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needed and raise it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must perfectly coincide with the vision of the organization.
He should also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the work of the team.
These conditions have not yet been met.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
“The Patrick told me about his decision today,” Sakik said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award for Best League Coach during his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and victory in the Central Division, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and lost the playoffs for the last two years.
The Avalanche team announced the rating of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 season and five points behind the Wild team in the fight for the second preferential ticket to participate in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper from the Hall of Fame, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two with Montreal Canadiens and with Avalanche.
North Sea oilmen resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers’ strikes on the issue of oil workers in the North Sea are suspended, and all parties to the discussion are proceeding to a new round of talks, leading representatives of the parties said.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, under the jurisdiction of Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve current disputes,” the statement said.
We will hold several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting from the beginning of next week, to look at the problems with a fresh look.
The unions reported that their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was directed against potential wage cuts up to 30 percent.
Wood Group this year reduced rates paid to contract employees operating in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company’s rate cuts occurred after a 10 percent rate cut for contract employees working on the shore in 2014.
According to the company, additional cuts will give it the space necessary to overcome the decline of the market.
Shell, for its part, has reduced thousands of people and announced plans to stop oil and gas activities in the countries of up to 10, as it rationalizes its activities as a result of its mega-merging with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the downturned oil prices: the economic situation has worsened due to the decision to withdraw from the European Union, adopted in June by the UK.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor conflicts that have arisen in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital for the regional economy.
“In the North Sea, and throughout the country, we need an economy that would work for the majority, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, contrasting with an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler Measures the Rotation Rate of Stars in the Pleiades Cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler Space Telescope helped astronomers to collect the most complete catalog of speeds of rotation of stars included in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and how periods of rotation relate to planet formation.
“We hope that by matching our results with other star clusters, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system,” said Louise Riballe, a researcher at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at the California Institute of Technology.
The Cluster of Pleiades is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many stars in the cluster are now only reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They rotate as fast as they never will be.
At their peak rotation speeds, these growing stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
By traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a braking effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star, tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots, such as sunspots.
The latest reciprocating catalog suggests that more massive stars orbit more slowly than less massive stars.
Riball compares stars to dancers: larger ones make pirouettes more slowly than smaller ones.
“In ballet, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, while those that rotate faster usually refer to very light stars,” Riballe said.
Since the cluster of Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the properties of stars with the speed of rotation.
“The Pleiada Starskombo provides a starting point for theoretical models of rotation of stars, both younger and older,” Riballe said.
We still want to learn a lot about how, where and why the stars slow down their speed of their rotation and hang their “dance shoes” on their nail, figuratively speaking.
Riballe and her colleagues detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades rotation speeds in three new articles, which will soon be published in an Astronomical Journal.
The investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in the Crimea is conducted by two departments, Kommersant writes.
The FSB is collecting evidence of the involvement of detainees in the preparation of sabotage in the Crimea.
As previously reported, the confession was given by a resident of the Ukrainian city Energodar Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as objects for sabotage, he considered the chemical plant "Titan" in Armyansk, an oil depot in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, a gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officers believe that it was not possible to detain not all accomplices of saboteurs.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the newspaper notes.
The head coach of the Russian national football team was Stanislav Cherchesov
At the meeting of the Executive Committee of the Russian Football Union, it was decided to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with it will be designed for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the RFU Executive Committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov to the post of head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a well-known player who previously played in the Moscow "Spartacus" in the position of goalkeeper, as well as a coach with a solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartak", "Pearl-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as the Warsaw "Legia", which became the winner of the national championship and the Cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it is he who gets the duty to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauce, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information according to which the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the leadership of the RFU has set a goal for Stanislav Cherchesov to bring the Russian national team to the semifinals and win medals.
As the coach himself stated, as a top priority, he considers the creation of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players the opportunity to prove themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he is glad that the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian team will hold on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
We will remind, earlier the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was occupied by Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching in the CSKA club.
He announced his resignation after the failed performance of the national team of Russia at Euro 2016 in France.
At the same time, he took responsibility for the poor result of the national team on himself.
Clamped between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during a long struggle against apartheid.
However, after independence from South Africa in 1990, a 2.4 million country has made tremendous strides, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia’s success is that the government pays great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take a good opportunity for free primary and secondary education, many poor countries in secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce a tuition fee for “cost reimbursement”.
However, in Namibia, primary schooling is free of charge.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The authorities are also actively working in other important areas.
Efforts to destroy malaria have reduced the number of annual cases by 97% over the past ten years.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, it is declining in Namibia.
Compared to the 1993 indicator, Gini, which is a standard indicator of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, this figure was one of the highest in the world.
Poverty fell from 69% in 1993 to less than 30 percent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 per day) has also decreased, from nearly 53% to less than 23 percent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country was far ahead of the United States and other rich states.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index", which is made up of human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia manages to maintain high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional valuation methods, remains quite high - almost 28%.
And, like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high incidence of HIV/AIDS, nearly 17 per cent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is among the above-average countries, but the authorities insist that their state is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties inherent in poorly developed economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
On the territory of the country in the deserts live isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers, which in one way or another should be integrated into modern society, without losing their identity.
The integration of people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, this is even more difficult: just like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
However, Namibia did not think to give up, the country solves the problems facing it.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions came together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides cheap medical care not only to its own citizens, but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical institutions in the northern regions of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia talks about building a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupt neighbors.
The Namibians realized that they did not choose their neighbors, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - to share scarce water resources, participate in regional medical projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
In addition, the Government of Namibia has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse by fostering the enrichment of the few at the expense of many.
The authorities understand that the income from the natural wealth of Namibia must be invested in infrastructure and production capacities.
They are also aware that it would be irresponsible not to seek to obtain maximum profit from the sale of the country’s resources, and revise investment laws and mining contracts to make sure it is.
Transparency is crucial to this process, so the government’s strong support for freedom of speech is so important.
As the head of state Hage Gaingob noted, the media often say what he does not like.
But after the struggle for the freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms received, the president said.
Not all of Namibia’s key resources are exhausted.
Some, such as fishing, are revolving, and the Government is making every effort to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that begin with serious flaws – racism, the colonial system, inequality and low level of development – can embark on a path to common prosperity.
Its achievement deserves international recognition and imitation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna" - the oldest gold objects created by man (4600 - 4200 BC).
Perhaps, it was the loudest archaeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, during the excavations of the Varna necropolis, a fantastic number of gold artifacts were found - more than three thousand total weight of 6 kilograms.
Only one burial, known as "grave No. 43", was extracted 990 gold objects with a total weight of more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the oldest gold in the world may soon move to a nondescript bead, found by archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yuniche.
Unlike Varna, the port city, Tell Yuniche is located away from the sea, near the village of Yunazite, Pazardzhik district.
Bustina is a gold stripe folded into a ring.
Yavor Boyajdzhiev, the head of excavations in Tell Yuniche, dated the discovery of 4600 BC and stated that she was older than Varna’s gold by at least 200 years.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date back to about the same period, 4600 - 4200. BC.
There are no technologies that allow to date the metal with impeccable accuracy at present.
Why does the belief in which gold is older?
Obviously, Professor Boyadzhiev knows more than he told Reuters: “I am quite sure that Yunazite gold is older than Varna’s gold.”
This is a finding of extreme importance: in appearance it is a tiny object, but it is large enough to take a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadzhiev said that in the near future scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re- and more thoroughly study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help to date the bead with the maximum possible accuracy.
The place of discovery also explains a lot.
Tell Yunaztake is a famous settlement, even if you have never heard of it.
Currently, Tell Yunazite is considered the oldest "city" of Europe.
Tell was founded by the descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7 millennium BC.
Over the following centuries, the processing of metals developed rapidly in this region, from the development of the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the domestic historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: the Balkan-Carpathian Metallurgical Province.
In 5 millennia BC, urban-type settlements began to arise around the centers of metalworking.
Now they are called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunocite is perhaps the most ancient, since the artifacts of 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Yuniche the prototype of a modern city, although it is a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
“This is the place older than Sumer by a thousand years,” says Boyadzhiev, referring to the generally accepted opinion that urban culture originated in the south of Mesopotamia – modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual sense of the word.
The excavations of Tell Yunazite have been conducted since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated almost 12 hectares, which is about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached three meters in height.
Little has been preserved from houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish streets, public buildings, urban dense buildings, a “business center” and residential outskirts.
Tell Yunactace is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay figurines of birds were found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of a local cult.
"Avian City" was destroyed around 4100 BC - perhaps by Indo-European tribes that came from the northeast.
Nomads had no cities, but there were horses and weapons.
Three-meter fortress walls did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found obvious signs of a severe massacre: the remains of old people, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by live axes were found inside the houses.
New findings and new facts appear annually, changing the usual ideas about the ancient history of mankind.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the “lost” first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus in the search for this civilization was the "Varden gold", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It is logical that Varna’s gold luxury had to precede something—something like a tiny golden bead created in Tell Yunic.
Porsche artificially aged the 911 Targa
It is officially stated that the preparation of the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is manually conducted by specialists of the unit who work with serial machines.
"Retro bow" consists, for example, in a special color of the body Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the tar received branded white graphics along the sides and special 20-inch wheels RS Spyder, as well as some body design details painted in the "white-gold metallic".
In the interior of retro-cleanings is noticeably smaller: it differs, by and large, gray-blue design, new chairs with extended ranges of electrical adjustments and trimmed black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive a car case as a gift and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant specialists of the Porsche Exclusive did not touch: the retro-targa in terms of characteristics quite coincides with the serial.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharger of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp. and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is able to accelerate to 100 km / h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in a limited edition, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car is reported.
Facebook and ad blockers unleashed an “arms race”
The recent introduction of Facebook technology that prevented the closure of advertising on the pages of the social network, provoked the developers of solutions to block advertising for response.
AdBlock Plus has released an “antidote,” but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has advertised its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time
Representatives of the social network noted that, seeking to deceive the new technology of “unlocked” advertising, the decision from AdBlock Plus together with commercial ads blocks many ordinary posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret over this policy of AdBlock Plus and promised to solve the problem soon.
As told by a source among the developers of the social network to the publication TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the desktop website Facebook will be ready within the next few hours.
Thus, the social network and blockers unleashed a kind of “arms race”, trying to beat each other, the affected side were users who missed interesting records from friends or saw advertising where they were not accustomed to seeing it.
Ethical aspects of blocking ads have recently caused heated debates.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear before the court · Evening Murmansk.
His case has already been completed in the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The indictment of a 54-year-old man is very serious - committing violent acts of a sexual nature.
The investigation established that at the end of November 2015, the accused in the area of Pavlov Street in Murmansk committed acts of a sexual nature with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng will bring to Russia crosswan Fengguang 370 and a pickup truck Rich New - site Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a representative of the growing car class in China, combining the advantages of a minivan and crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms Moscow International Motor Show this year decided to ignore, so the void of the exhibition halls of the Crocus Expo will be filled by Chinese companies.
In particular, a powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has great views of the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting new products in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crossbar, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (slightly less than 550 thousand. RUB. at the current course).
Such a price tag is unlikely to shine on Russians, and the question of deliveries to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 in June sales managed to get to 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the large ground clearance (175 mm) and a protective plastic body kit along the lower perimeter of the body, it can be ranked as crossovers.
The crosswane is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370th has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden slabs, but the large vertical touch screen shown in the photo "like Tesla" on the center console was only on the early exhibition copies of the crosswyn, and cars with "music" were sold simpler.
Five of the seven seats easily fold, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, the maximum trunk volume is 1500 liters.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 provides only one - 1.5-liter gasoline "atmosphere" with a capacity of 115 hp, docked with a 5-speed manual gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises a sparing budget of the owner an appetite of 6.7 l / 100 km.
The Rich New Pickup is a well-known to the Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the previous generation, but with a slightly refined design by Chinese stylists.
Despite the obsolete design, this model is still in stable demand among the Chinese consumer as a reliable and unpretentious “workhorse”.
At a similar price, Rich New will certainly interest the Russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become exorbitantly expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: petrol 2.4 l (137 hp) or a 2.5-liter turbodiesel (116 hp).
The gearbox is only mechanics, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a rigidly connected "front".
There will be a new flagship A9 sedan at the Dongfeng booth, its Russian premiere announced the representative office of the Chinese firm back in June.
Minf-like crossovers in the Chinese market is becoming more and more, one of the latest innovations - Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian lineup Dongfeng consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
For seven months of this year, dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Notifications for the transport tax will cease to be sent by mail - site Driving www.zr.ru
The tax inspectorate has changed the procedure for sending notices of property taxes.
All Russian car owners are accustomed to the scheme that has not changed for years: in the summer and autumn they receive by mail receipts for the payment of transport tax for the previous year.
However, this year many will not wait for them.
The fact is that the tax inspectorate without too much noise changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Account of the taxpayer" on the official website of the department nalog.ru, the notifications will come electronically.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians online users and crossed them out of a standard, “paper” mailing.
The innovation will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still receive the usual letters.
However, the opportunity to return to the old scheme is also available to holders of the account on the site.
To do this, they will have to visit the tax office during August and write a statement.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and more convenient.
The notification will appear in the “personal account” immediately after the compilation, while the letter will go for several days and may completely be lost.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the Agency to seriously save on the mailing list.
On the other hand, the modest news on the website of the inspection is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some could register in the “personal account” to receive a one-time service and have long forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for notifications by mail and, without realizing it, fall into the category of non-payers with all the ensuing consequences.
Access to the "Personal Account of the Taxpayer" is carried out in three ways: through the account of the portal goslugi.ru, using an electronic signature or the entry of the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally in any department of the tax inspectorate (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
The notifications began in July.
The tuning Mercedes-Benz G-Class, in which the improvements are aimed at achieving a very high return, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not bother the masters of the company G-Power, who took up the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human masters is alien to its masters.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571-horsepower flying sledgehammer with aerodynamics of the tank and the acceleration to a hundred in 5.4 seconds?
Pumping up the "muscles" of the crazy "helic - masters took advantage of the 5.5-liter supercharged "eight".
But the dynamics of acceleration to a hundred has improved by indistinguishable 0.1 seconds, and now the flying "brick" is capable of a breakthrough for 5.3 seconds.
However, accelerations from average speeds are probably given to him much better.
The speed limit is intimidating: if the standard G 63 does not drive faster than 210 km / h, then the tuning SUV with a deactivated electronic "collar" is capable of squeezing 250 km / h.
The car is almost indistinguishable from its factory primary source, with the exception of other wheels - 23-inch Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach announced an astounding concept coupe 6 m long, which will be presented as part of the Elegance Contest in Pebble Beach.
