The July issue is traditionally rented out during the Moscow Film Festival, and this, of course, is very sad: to read the pages when the soul is eager for Chabrol.
Nevertheless, we will tell you about MIFF next time (so far I will only complain that this year the inexplicable idea that the happy owners of purchased tickets are many times more important for the festival than accredited guests, a ridiculous and quite offensive principle that no normal film festival in the world is guilty of) has finally strengthened in the minds of the organizers, and in this issue we report on what we saw in Cannes and at Kinotavr.
The cover of the July issue is adorned with another pleasant face - the title character of the film "Predators" produced by Robert Rodriguez, and inside the magazine, try not to miss the story about "Inception" by Christopher Nolan (the man, by the way, who rebooted "Batman..."), the most - no fools - anticipated film of the summer.
And this time we are publishing the first part of a fairly detailed guide to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, and here there is certainly no need to advertise anything, and it is clear that the author of "Suspicion" and "Rope" is our Tatyana Aleshicheva, Boris Gleyzerov, Anna Golovnya, Nick De Semlin, Dan Jolin, Tamara Dondurey, Nikolai Karaev, Denis Korsakov, Maria Kuvshinova, Ivan Kulikov,  Will Lawrence, Sergey Mezenov, Sergey Natapov, Ian Nathan, Kim Newman, Zaira Ozova, Nev Pierce, Alexei Prostyakov, Serafima Skibyuk, Adam Smith, Moore Soboleva, Vasily Stepanov, Alexander Strelkov, Ollie Richards, Oleg Tishchenkov, Alena Logunova, Chris Hewitt, Olga Shakina, despite her brilliant track record, were suspected of spying for the Russians and decided to catch her at all costs.
Driven into a corner, she will dye her hair black as we know it and go to search for the truth herself.
Another action movie with Angelina Jolie in the role of a fatal boy-woman promises to further strengthen the position of the actress in the action genre.
She will arrange one accident after another, run along the walls a la "Matrix" and scatter strong men in the same strict suits like children.
This is how beauty should save the world.
Here he is, his dear, who blew up and repaired the world with the "Fifth Element" and made Milla Jovovich the most beautiful woman in the universe.
Bruce Willis was his most superhero guy, and Gary Oldman was the most stylish and flawless embodiment of Evil.
And at the same time, all together turned out to be not a boring American-type blockbuster about the salvation of humanity, but the cutest live carnival.
What did Besson do for 13 years between "Element..." and "Adele..." I don't want to remember.
He, to put it mildly, did not sit idle, but all this script and producer fuss and rare, exhausted directorial performances will be forgotten.
But "Adele..." is hardly.
When you watch this movie, it seems that for 13 years in front of us was not our Besson, but some kind of double.
And he, the real one, lived in a small apartment in Montmartre, sipped wine in the café opposite and made up a story about the most charming adventurer.
Retelling the plot (even in general terms), fueling expectations, in this case is more sinful than usual.
The whole incredible drive here lies in the fact that surprises await you at every turn or remark.
And all as one pleasant.
Either a girl or a vision
ADELE'S EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES
The most dashing adventure movie of the decade hints that "The Extraordinary Adventures of Adele" will begin as "Amélie", rush towards <Jurassic Park", continue with "Indiana Jones" and "The Mummy", and end with "Titanic".
The film is based on the first volume of Jacques Tardy's comics about journalist Adele Blanc-Sec.
Louise Bourgoin starred in only three films before Adèle.
The actress became famous for her role in The Girl from Monaco, for which she was nominated for a César Award.
The director does not run after the viewer with an outstretched hand, begging him to evaluate special effects, scenery or tricks, but carries him along, like an old-fashioned novelist who exclaims before a big journey to the center of the earth or to the end of the world: "Forward, my reader, great things await us!"
At the same time, Besson treats genre cinema, about which he knows absolutely everything, unceremoniously and cheerfully, like a boy who has seen enough old films and read Jules Verne.
Manipulating platitudes, not denying themselves cynicism and not being shy about taking risks
DIRECTOR: Luc Besson
CAST: Louise Burgousne, Mathieu Amalric, Frédéric Belle, Gilles Lelouch
SYNOPSIS: Strange things happened in Paris in 1912.
The city was alarmed by an ancient monster that had been awakened to life by an old medium.
The fossil creature is chased by the police, as well as the famous hunter, a couple of scientists from the Museum of Natural History and journalist Adele Blanc-Sec, who has a deal not so much with the beast itself as with the medium - she needs to save her sister.
For the same purpose, the girl drags a real mummy from Egypt.
AIRING JULY 22
"Adele..." is the case when parody becomes the pinnacle of the genre itself and is able to radically change it, directing it along a new path.
This was the case with Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, with Quentin Tarantino's gangster action movies, with the aforementioned "Indiana Jones" (he was bowed down to and ridiculed here), and finally, with the same "The Fifth Element".
Besson's style in this film consists of verbal trickery, actor's clowning and plot balancing act (circus terms are quite appropriate - the unity of the two arts here is organic and stronger than ever).
A couple of words should be said about Adele herself.
She embodied the undeservedly forgotten type of an adventurer, who takes not so much by the exploitation of sexuality as by the purest courage and courage.
In the movies, such girls, as a rule, are assigned some kind of macho or wolf-eyed romantic on duty
TEXT: ALEXANDER STRELKOV
Face to face with history
There is only a timid and comical admirer who only spins under his feet (only his knowledge of zoology is useful).
Therefore, the energetic girl does not waste time on amorous trifles, but has fun in the company of ancient corpses, which, by the way, play a key role in the plot.
Trained on numerous genre "cats" and seemingly completely sour, Luc Besson showed an unexpected creative dash, recalling that the border between the preferences of bored visitors to megamalls and highbrow regulars of art-house halls is easily overcome by films for cheerful madmen.
Playing an adventure movie without sadness, fear and reproach
DEATH ROOM
Hermetic horror with a claim to psychology and political context In 2002, Jonathan Liebesman's debut horror film was scolded by critics, but the public liked it and made good money at the box office, and most importantly, it caught the eye of producer Michael Bay.
This is how the young director found himself in a factory forging new horrors according to old patterns: Bay set out to reshoot all the horror classics in the form of remakes and entrusted Liebesman with the prequel to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2006).
Criticism grimaced again, but the audience liked it again – Liebesman worked in the spirit of the "new scars", focusing on the excessive physiology of violence.
In general, on his example, you can observe how the whole genre is tossed about in convulsions, trying to invent new ways of influencing the jaded public: the naturalistic blood of splatters merges with the catch-up of slasher films.
The plot is reminiscent of the Saw franchise, but without liters of blood.
Among the prototypes is Vincenzo Natali's debut film "Cube". The film was not made by Michael Bay.
So in "Death Room" Liebesmann was forced to take a different path: he preferred a smarter option to a stupid massacre or a monotonous run from a maniac - almost without the notorious blood, but with a psychological game and riddles.
Evil doctors here play cat and mouse with test subjects.
And three men in a locked room are trying to work out a survival strategy: unite in a team or shoot each other?
Play by the rules and obey orders from the outside?
Or try to break your cage at any cost?
Not only they are tested, but also a young ambitious employee of the special services, who is tested for ruthlessness by an experienced professor skilled in wild experiments.
PLOT: For $250, four volunteers sign up for a simple test.
They are put in an isolated room and given a pile of sheets of paper with meaningless questions.
Then a polite man in a white coat enters the room, introduces himself as a doctor and shoots one of the subjects in the head.
A game of survival begins, with government agents closely watching behind the glass.
Too thoughtful for a horror movie, but not enough for a frank arthouse
He can make small talk, and hit him in the face with a fire extinguisher, but he can't miss a single skirt.
Charming Nastya, on the contrary, is cautious and adamant in her sympathies.
She is hurt by her father's courtly lifestyle and openly peeps at how he, as if parodying the famous scene from Paul Verhoeven's "Showgirls", dives into the pool for another romantic victim.
The daughter rebels, and her father tempts her young chosen one from a poor family with money.
But the main topic of the family conflict is not at all the difference between generations or the choice of profession, it, one way or another, is already predetermined, but the girl's unsuccessful attempts to refute the obvious idea that in modern Moscow everything is bought and sold.
The sluggish melodramatic Mher Mkrtchan, together with Pavel Bardin, shot a comedy with Ivan Urgant "Three and a Snowflake".
The father of his maturing daughter in the comedy genre was convincingly portrayed by Depardieu
The fractional plot winds around the love affairs of the characters, who are constantly talking about psychology, and themselves, apparently according to the director's witty find, focus on the language of gaze and gesture.
Secondary plot branches (a girl crippled in a car accident, whom Alexei wants to marry, an alcoholic athlete played by Sergei Gorobchenko), alas, are drawn only dotted.
I especially feel sorry for the line about the business of buying up football players, which remained behind the scenes.
PLOT: More than anything else in the world, the agent for the sale of football stars is concerned about the fate of his minor daughter Nastya.
The compassionate dad himself changes women like expensive shirts, but the daughter is about to turn eighteen, and she must certainly marry a guy "with a core".
What is the disappointment of the businessman when Nastya in the struggle for independence and in defiance of her father chooses his peer and business partner.
But with a potential slogan for the audience of the film, the author hit the "nine": "Don't look for a problem where there is none." It is impossible to say more precisely.
Their similarity simply cannot but be striking.
In both films, there are squads of tough guys, soldiers of fortune, forced to take revenge on those who framed them, and in each company there is one beautiful girl.
The characters jump around almost the same parts of the world (both films begin in Latin America and end in the port of Los Angeles) and exploit the same spectacular shots - in both cases, something stuffed with dollar bills explodes, and a whirlwind of dollars descends on the scenery.
Even villains dressed in expensive costumes are not easy to distinguish from each other (they are played in both cases by Patricks - Jason Patrick here, Patrick Wilson there).
Zoë Saldan's previous role was Neytiri in Avatar.
Sylvain White used to shoot about dance battles - "Brotherhood of Dance".
Chris Evans was recently called to play the hero of other comics: he will be Captain America.
Director Sylvain White was inspired by the comic book series that came out in the 70s and was relaunched in the 2000s, Joe Carnahan - by the comedy series of the 80s.
It's just amazing how they, without agreeing, brought different material to an absolutely identical rumbling denominator, making rather heavy, predictable, unnecessary action films, reminiscent of a lot of pictures with Willis and Schwarzenegger (comparisons invariably turn out to be in favor of Bruce and Arnold).
If you have to choose between these two films, then "Losers" looks a little nicer and clearly more victorious in terms of efficiency (after all, the budget is three and a half times less).
At least there is Zoe Saldana, who is very suitable for bazooka
CAST: Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Zoe Saldana, Chris Evans, Patrick Wilson, Idris Elba, Columbus Short
SYNOPSIS: During an operation in the Bolivian jungle, a group of seasoned commandos working for the CIA was framed by their own superiors: the helicopter with the children they tried to save was blown up, and the soldiers themselves are considered dead from that second.
But they are alive - and intend at all costs to take revenge on the scoundrel with a languid voice who arranged all this.
It's all cute, but honestly, it's worth spending an hour and a half of your life on a White painting only if you don't have any more interesting options at all.

A simple story about an escaped Romanian convict
Into a Romanian low-budget film that won a prize at a prestigious international film festival.
In principle, having only these data in hand, you can vividly imagine the hypothetical content of the picture, and even some specific details of the form.
Without any doubt, the cinema promises to be acutely social.
Of course, it will be realistic, and tough.
There is a high probability of participation of non-professional actors.
Also, there will be a lot of Romanian poverty in the film (yes, yes, poverty does not know nationality, but Romanian, as our festival laureates prove from film to film, is especially poor).
Also, without knowing the year of release, you can easily mistake what is happening on the screen for the exercises of some underground critical realists from the Warsaw Pact countries, who were lectured on Bresson in the early 80s
The film won the Grand Prix of the Jury at the Berlin IFF.
The script is based on the play by Andreea Valean, whose work is in particular demand among directors of the Romanian "new wave".
Cinematographer Marius Panduru often works with Corneliu Porumboiu.
All that has been said is true for Florin Serban's debut work, and - don't get us wrong - it is not at all abusive, but recommendatory: the Romanian "new wave" is at that blissful stage of development when the faith of its representatives in the methods of
I have not yet wavered in my work.
And this moment must be seized: only thanks to this faith can one endure the one-and-a-half-hour spectacle of a Romanian juvenile colony and surrender to the charisma of the most talented Pistereanu (whose history, despite the abyss separating the two cultures, can easily be
convert into exploitation a la the 70s, with a cowboy who decided to walk from the jail, from where he will soon be leaving, to the nearest saloon).
CAST: Gheorg Pistereanu, Ada Condeescu, Mihai Constantin, Clara Voda, Marian Bratu
SYNOPSIS: After serving his four years, 18-year-old convict Silviu (Pistereanu) is soon to be released, but unexpectedly finds out that his mother wants to take his younger brother with her to Italy.
From this moment on, the behavior of the young man becomes inadequate.
An affair with a social worker Anna further encourages the guy to desperate actions, the meaning of which is exhausted by the title of the picture.
What nonsense all this is!
If you want to watch - watch.
Not a bad debut, inspiring a faint hope that a decent direction will someday grow out of Romanian arthouse
Cartoon about the joys of villainy and family life
The directorial debut of a man named Grob (Sop) and his co-author Renaud was made under the auspices of producer Christopher Meledandri, the gray cardinal of American animation, responsible, in particular, for all "Ice Ages", "Horton" and "Robots".
"Despicable Me" is probably the best work of his team: the picture is beautifully drawn (by the way, it makes sense to watch it in the ZO), especially if you like when different objects are constantly trying to jump from the screen into the hall), it is tolerably written, and, most importantly, there is not a single joke below the waist, because of which on "Ice Ages" you had to shyly squeeze into a chair and cover children's ears with your hands.
It is clear that the reason for the change of course was not the sense of proportion of the authors, but the blatant asexuality of the protagonist, which, in turn, is dictated by the unwillingness to touch on the topic of pedophilia in any way.
For the "adult" part here, in addition to the main collision of lonely fatherhood, is responsible for a rather harsh black humor (which, I would like to think, we owe to director Coffin).
In general, this is a very nice movie - so much so that at some point it turns out to be even too perfect and correct.
You can feel the painstaking work of a well-coordinated team of marketers, who thought out every little thing so that the film would appeal to all categories of citizens.
It's not like we want to see the characters of a children's cartoon eaten by cannibals or destroyed by an atomic explosion
SYNOPSIS: The long-nosed villain Gru, whose childhood dreams of astronautics have transformed over the years into the idea of stealing the moon, is forced to resort to the help of children to fulfill a grand plan and eliminate a young competitor.
In a certain advanced orphanage, he adopts three female orphans - Margot with glasses, Edith with a hat and Agnes, comparable only to the cat from Shrek in terms of killer cuteness.
As it usually happens, children immediately transform the plans of adults.
The main character is drawn from Christopher Meledandri - both of them are bald, nosed and prone to black humor.
In the original, the main characters were voiced by Steve Carrell and Jason Segel.
In the finale, Gru dances the part of Travolta
A car rolls up to an abandoned trailer somewhere in the middle of a conditional desert, from which three pairs of the most solid tits come out.
Quite so.
In themselves, the bearers of this gift are not so important.
The camera confidently fixes attention on this part of the body.
For connoisseurs, we immediately announce the good news - the whole film is designed in the same vein.
Rick Jacobson understands the most correct things in female beauty and the casting was carried out in such a way that what is happening on the screen is of secondary importance.
And a lot of funny things happen.
The "broker", "killer" and "stripper" are rummaging in the sand, dousing themselves with water (don't ask why), carrying some kind of blizzard and periodically fighting quite fiercely.
The creators believe that a swearing chick with generous shapes, smeared in dirt, with a broken nose and shining white teeth is cool.
Things is primarily focused on classic sexplotting films.
Rick Jacobson directed episodes of "Xena, Warrior Queen" and "The Amazing Journey of Hercules".
A film close in spirit at the Moscow box office is "A Gun for Jennifer".
It's also cool when a beauty twists the balls of a bandit, a punk fights paired with a Japanese schoolgirl, a samurai sword and lesbian sex are attached to this; And the intrigue is unwound through an endless number of flashbacks.
In general, for a fetishist moviegoer, a real Klondike of pleasures is found here.
It is understandable, of course, that Jacobson and his gang, filming this trash parody, had a lot of fun, but the task itself seems rather strange.
If it were not for the physical characteristics of the actresses, it would have become boring by the middle.
We can assume that this game came to us from the night channel for adults (Jacobson, by the way, often takes on serial episodes)
CAST: Julia Vot, Erin Cummings, America Olivo, Michael Hirst, Ron Melendez
PLOT: Three dangerous beauties bring a mafia leader to the desert, who has diamonds worth a substantial amount hidden somewhere here.
Having achieved nothing and having shot the unfortunate bandit, the women begin to clash, fight with each other and scumbags periodically arriving from somewhere, as well as regularly kiss and squeeze.
In the course of the case, it turns out that all three are not what they imagined themselves to be at the beginning.
Apparently, in the author's opinion, it's even funnier this way.
A product for a narrow circle of lovers of monstrous bad taste
Yes, with his last picture "Judgment Day", diluted by "Mad Max" for the have-nots, Marshall made a serious misfire
Bloodthirsty and biting peplum restores the director's shattered trust.
The new politically incorrect and gloomy magnum opus is not shy of a modest budget, obvious sources of inspiration and ferocious B-category cinematic aesthetics.
There is in the film both the hooligan courage of "Warrior Dogs" and the bestial cruelty of "Descent".
The "Marshall Plan" to cleanse the "ashes" from the adhering post-gladiator film dirt, on the whole, worked.
In 2011, Kevin MacDonald will present his interpretation of the history of the Ninth Legion.
His battle-scarred legionnaires (among others, the unexpectedly colorful David Morrissey and Liam Cunningham) are tough men trying to marry their military duty with an irresistible desire to survive.
Murder and piquant details of the fulfillment of natural needs in ancient times are depicted here with love and thoroughness.
The scene of the extermination of the Ninth Legion, which took a lot of budget money, was directly inspired by the opening distribution in the German forests from the now standard "Gladiator" by Sir Ridley Scott, but for some reason I absolutely do not want to try to catch Marshall in plagiarism: he works honestly and without pretensions.
CAST: Michael Fassbender, Olga Kurylenko, Dominic West, Liam Cunningham, David Morrissey
PLOT: The lands of modern Scotland, occupied by the Holy Roman Empire.
The remote outpost where centurion Quintus Diaz (Fassbender) is serving is ruthlessly destroyed by a scouting company of the Picts.
Miraculously saved, Diaz is forced to first join the infamous Ninth Legion, and then, with a handful of other surviving Romans, try to sneak away from a group of Pictish militants led by the sadist Ethan (Kurylenko).
The subtle arthouse actor has so far managed to win back only sharp-character supporting roles in Hollywood, but I really want to believe that after Centurion the situation will change.
Peplum is a revised and expanded edition.
Almost like "Gladiator", only more modest and harsher
The continuation of the story about the schoolgirl Bella (Kristen Stewart) and her difficult relationship with two extremely promising young people - the pale-faced vampire Edward (Robert Pattinson) and the werewolf bodybuilder Jacob (Taylor Lautner).
Pattinson's fans held their breath.
A large-scale film version of the animated series about a bald sorcerer boy designed to bring peace to the four kingdoms.
The lord of fire started a bloody war and subjugated his neighbors.
Young Aang will be able to stop him only if he learns to control all the elements and becomes an Avatar.
Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) knows how to steal other people's thoughts and works tirelessly in the field of industrial espionage.
Penetrating into the dream of the object, he makes the sleeping brain work according to its own rules.
But this time he has to do the opposite - leave in one head what was not there.
A pictorial lesson on managing illusory worlds from Christopher Nolan.
An experienced wizard (Nicolas Cage) finds a young assistant in the hope of defeating an evil magician (Alfred Molina) together.
With the help of destructive spells, they will arrange bedlam with dragons and explosions in the middle of Manhattan.
Bald as a billiard ball, the kitty has plotted to take over the whole world, and now the super-agent dogs are forced to join forces with their meowing antagonists.
The second episode of a furry family comedy.
Several inveterate thugs, led by the flimsy-looking Royce (Adrien Brody), mysteriously find themselves on another planet, where stylish fanged aliens open a sports hunt for them.
The return of the iconic character of the 80s to the big screen.
Consider George Clooney, who teamed up with rock photographer-turned-director Anton Corbijn (Control) for a highly interesting existential study of the psychology of an aging hitman hiding from the people in a small Italian town and belatedly comprehending human nature.
"A visionary artist of Corbijn's caliber and the magnificent George Clooney is a film alliance made in heaven," the studio press release boasts.
In addition, this project is another confirmation of the longest love relationship in Clooney's life - with Italy: the shooting took place in the picturesque town of Castel del Monte in Abruzzo.
Based on Martin Booth's novel A Very Secretive Gentleman, Rowan Joffe made some adjustments to his script: the American narrator took the place of the English narrator, and the main character turned from an illegal gunsmith into a simple killer.
Otherwise, the story is close to the original: while the killer Jack is trying to deal with his last case and finally quit the lucrative craft, his icy heart melts under the charm of the local priest (Paolo Bonacelli) and a street prostitute (Tecla Ruten), with whom Clooney's character instantly falls in love.
"Jack tempts fate," the official synopsis reads.
The dangerous messenger of darkness is getting closer and closer to him, and the mysterious lady who hires him may well not be who she says she is."
Judging by the trailer, Corbijn's visual experiments, seasoned with Clooney's ashen hair (the film looks like a long clip 02), have reached a qualitatively new level.
Daniel Radcliffe will play the main role in the film adaptation of Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front
Can I snap you with a photo gun!?
Johnny Depp could be seen in two places at the same time this season.
Firstly, in Venice on the set of the thriller "The Tourist" by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ("The Lives of Others").
There he plays a tourist in love with Angelina Jolie's heroine.
Secondly, in Puerto Rico on the set of The Rum Diary, an adaptation of the debut novel by the legendary Hunter S. Thompson.
The director and screenwriter of the project is Bruce Robinson ("Withnail and Me"), whose last directorial work was the thriller Jennifer 8 in 1992.
Looking at the work of the poster artists of the domestic prison drama, you can not even doubt what inspired them.
But you can't approach the issue of implementing the idea literally!
However, it is good that the heroine of the Russian film, although someone else's, is not bald at all.
Director Dennis Dugan mainly specializes in projects with Adam Sandler.
They already have four joint projects on their account: "Lucky Gilmore", "Big Daddy", "Chuck and Larry: Fire Wedding", "Don't Mess with Gohan!".
In July, the fifth comedy, Classmates, is released, and the sixth is in progress, The Pretender Wife with Jennifer Aniston and Nicole Kidman.
The schedule also includes the seventh film - the romantic comedy Jack and Jill, where Sandler will play Jack and his twin sister Jill at the same time.
Matthew Vaughn, who is remembered by the viewer this year for the enchanting action movie "Kick-Ass", will reboot the X-Men.
In the film X-Men: First Class, the director first of all invited James McAvoy, giving him the role of a young Professor X.
Rosamund Pike will play the telepathic mutant Emma Frost, nicknamed the White Queen, Amber Heard will reincarnate as the blue-skinned Mystique, and Michael Fassbender will presumably become Magneto.
While the filming of the new Bond series is postponed, its new director Sam Mendes does not have time to get bored.
His to-do list includes the musical "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory" and the film adaptation of Isaan McHewsne's novel "On the Beach".
The script is adapted by the author himself.
Carey Mulligan is offered the main female role.
Gary Oldman examines the role of the practical Major George Smiley, the protagonist of John le Carré's novel series, in the film adaptation of the thriller Spy Get Out.
In the first adaptation of this work in 1979, Alec Guinness played.
The new version will be shot by Danish director Thomas Alfredson, the creator of the horror "Let Me In".
Tom Tykwer adapts David Mitchell's best-selling fantasy novel Cloud Atlas.
According to the director, this is not an easy (there are six parallel storylines in the novel), but an extremely interesting work.
Offers from him have already been received by Tom Hanks, Halla Berry, James McAvoy, Ian McKellen and Natalie Portman.
In Crimea, the filming of the international action movie Maxim Korostyshevsky under the working title "Soldiers of Fortune" is taking place.
It is dedicated to millionaires who went to a real war for their own money in search of adrenaline.
The cast includes Christian Slater, Sean Bean, Ving Rhames, Dominic Monaghan, Oksana Korostyshevskaya and others.
The premiere of the film is scheduled for early 2011.
Sam Rockwell will play in the comedy "Baby Jesus" together with English pop star Pixie Lotg
Megan Fox fired from 'Transformers 3'
According to the Ragatoipe film company, the dismissal "is not related to the interview in which Fox compared Michael Bay to Hitler."
Nevertheless, the place of the main character and the new lover of the hero Shia LaBeouf is likely to be taken by the English model Rosie Huntington-Wheatley.
The girl has no experience in cinema, so she will have accelerated acting courses.
This fact should not scare the sophisticated viewer - in the history of cinema there are a lot of examples of successful retraining of models into actresses.
Charlize Theron ("Monstro"), Angelina Jolie ("Girl, Interrupted"), Jessica Lange ("Blue Sky", "Tootsie"), Kim Basinger ("L.A. Confidential"), Jennifer Connelly ("A Beautiful Mind"), Geena Davis ("The Accidental Tourist") and "First Vice-Miss USA-86" Halle Berry ("Monster's Ball") started as models or starred for fashion magazines, eventually received a well-deserved Oscar.
Beauties Milla Jovovich, Cameron Diaz, Monica Bellucci and, what is especially pleasant, our compatriot Olga Kurylenko also succeeded in acting.
Their high awards are clearly at arm's length.
In short, Rosie has someone to look up to.
Valeria Gai Germanika, who earned a Special Mention from the Cannes jury in 2008 for the film "Everyone Dies, but I Stay" and directed the scandalous television series "School", received the position of creative director at the MT TV channel.
The channel's management believes that it is Valeria who will be able to bring the desired and necessary changes.
In particular, they are already planning to shoot their own series (about teenagers or about vampires).
Germanika also began casting new hosts.
The comedy "Kolotilov" directed by Leo Gabriadze and produced by Timur Bekmambetov unexpectedly turned into "Twists".
The main theme of the film remains the same - a provincial teacher of the Russian language Slava Kolotilov (Konstantin Khabensky) hurries to Moscow to see his fiancée, but stays to coach a football team of street children.
The second storyline of the picture received a new development.
Instead of actress Elena Plaksina, the role of the capital's bride Nadia will be played by Milla Iovovich.
As an additional intrigue, a third will appear - Nadia's ex-fiancé Danya (Ivan Urgant).
Thus, in addition to the question of whether the backyard team will win the football championship, there is a dilemma of who will get Milla Jovovich.
Due to the constant delays in filming The Hobbit and the presence of a lot of side projects, Guillermo del Toro refused the position of director.
Studios are persuading producer Peter Jackson to take matters into his own hands, but he is ready to agree to this step only if there is an urgent need.
David Yates, who completed the Harry Potter saga, and Neill Blomkamp, whose film District 9, produced by Jackson, received an Oscar nomination, are named as possible successors.
Officially, the name of the new director will be announced at the next Sotes-Sop convention at the end of July.
Angelina Jolie will play Cleopatra
Maddened by the tight schedule, critics and filmmakers rushed at super speed between the Sochi Winter Theater, where screenings with master classes were held, and the Zhemchuzhina Hotel, where press conferences and round tables were held in a stream, barely having time to dive into the Black Sea.
The heroes of the competition films behaved to match - in almost every one of them someone fled somewhere: confused Asians from "Gastarbeiter" by Yusup Razykov and "Another Sky" by Dmitry Mamulia were looking for their missing grandson and wife, a fugitive bandit from Yuri Bykov's film "To Live"
The same cops were happily deceived by the hero of Klim Shipenko's detective story "Who am I?" - which, however, was remembered by the public rather for the presence of a totally naked Zhanna Friske in the frame.
Heroes of domestic show business also appeared in a couple of competitive films - in the film "Elephant" Sergey Shnurov played a trucker taking a circus animal to slaughter, and Evgeny Grishkovets speculated on his favorite topics - female betrayal, male loneliness, the healing power of alcohol - in the film production for two "Satisfaction", where business partners challenged each other to alcohol because of a lady.
However, business events at Kinotavr also bore a tangible imprint of the show - it was not boring at any of them.
At a round table dedicated to the fate of the Russian arthouse, Sergei Tolstikov, chairman of the Foundation for the Support of Russian Cinema, staged a picturesque quarrel with critics: "Do you even read the articles in the press that I read?" he asked the audience menacingly.
"I am writing them," the president of EPVEZ replied in confusion! Andrey Plakhov.
The scandals did not end there: towards the end of the festival, Alexei Fedorchenko's film "Ovsyanki" was suddenly removed from the competition program - he would go to Venice: the selectors of Mostra decided that the extra Russian screening was an obstacle to them.
Previously, Kinotavr did not interfere with the giants - films from large festivals were shown in Sochi more than once: this time, for example, Sergei Loznitsa's film My Happiness participated in the competition, which in the spring competed with Mikhalkov and Virasetakun on the Azure Beret.
Nikita Sergeevich visited the film of his former Cannes competitor at Kinotavr and said that he liked it.
The chairman of the jury, Karen Shakhnazarov, on the contrary, did not like Loznitsa's film at all - but under pressure from colleagues, he was forced to give it a prize for directing.
The award for the best debut - "Missing" - was received by the daughter
A terrible film encyclopedia of Russian life: a naïve, humane and rational hero is beaten, robbed and provoked to monstrous deeds without any apparent purpose.
A precisely staged, cleansing film-experience, made by a misanthrope with a mathematical education, which calls for only one thing - start thinking.
A debutant with a philosophical education, Mamulia calls the films quotes from Mamardashvili, avoids any events in the script and claims that the joy of the viewer is in the work of comprehending his inaccessible meditative films.
The most difficult film of Kinotavr has already been selected for the Karlovy Vary competition - the director's star has been born.
Impeccably dressed and trimmed programmer Leonid reacts to the world with restrained disgust, hiding in the hole of a neat bachelor life.
But a cast-iron woman descends on the house, the unfair hand of the punitive organs falls on the hero's head, and he begins a senseless run through Kafkaesque spaces and situations.
"Sometimes it is useful to work not only with debutants," producer Sabina Eremeeva triumphantly said from the stage, taking the prize.
Critics thought otherwise: in their opinion, Sabina simply managed to pull out the "inner debutant" from the coryphaeus of Russian art cinema.
And this is symptomatic - today in our cinema bison are moving after young people.
And not the other way around.
A documentary filmed in such a way that it blows your head cleaner than from a similar feature film.
The author is also interested in a screwdriver examining an electric meter, and a piece of unsalted butter drifting over a cast-iron pan -- all this turns the story of an unemployed miner, his rare-toothed lover and her criminal brother into a real doc with butter.
The winner of the short film competition, Nikolay Sokolov, tries on the black-and-white style of the French New Wave on the world of dormitory areas.
Let Godard's montage moves in the story of two schoolchildren, one of whom dreams of making a bomb and the other of playing Bach backwards, look strange, but thanks for the rare attempt to poeticize the surrounding reality.
"Three times a year - on the eve of Victory Day, Russia Day and City Day - about ten aircraft of the An-12, Il-18, An-32, An-24 types take to the sky, equipped for the duration of the work with meteorological equipment and technical means of influencing clouds and loaded with special environmentally friendly chemicals - liquid nitrogen, granulated carbon dioxide ("dry ice"), meteorological pyrocartridges with silver iodide and powdered reagents.
The process is as follows: planes at a distance of 50-100 kilometers from Moscow (depending on the length and power of the rain front) "break" the clouds coming to the city with these reagents. Particles of substances condense moisture around them.
As a result, precipitation falls earlier than planned and exactly where the impact on the cloud occurred."
For ten years now, work has been underway on a remake of the science fiction film, in which Michael York played the main role.
Recently, Karl Rinsch was appointed director (he already has a remake of Creatures from the Black Lagoon in his schedule), who became famous for his commercials.
Previously, the names of Bryan Singer (X-Men), James McTeague (V for Vendetta) and Joseph Kosinski (Tron: Legacy) were associated with the project.
According to the plot, the hero, who is thirty years old, is forced to flee from the death sentence, since the society of the future executes all citizens upon reaching this age.
Robert Rodriguez has acquired the rights to a rotoscopic fantasy cartoon of the 80s and plans to make a large-scale movie out of it.
The original was the fruit of the joint work of director Ralph Bakshi (the Lord of the Rings movie, 1976) and fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.
The theme of the cartoon was swords, magic and a large number of drawn boobs.
In it, the warrior Larne saves Princess Tigre and all the people from the evil ice lord Necron.
Rodriguez promises to pay attention to the creation of inhumans and barbarians on pterodactyls.
George A. Romero will send his zombies on vacation for the near future, as 1 himself plans to remake the classic giallo picture by Dario Argento.
The heroes will return to the big screens none other than Michael Bay - the lord of action, explosions and horror remakes.
The remake will be directed by Damin Chen, who will also adapt the script.
Argento and Romero had already collaborated on "Day of the Dead" and filmed "Two Evil Looks" together in 1990.
This time, Dario is not directly involved in the project, but his brother Claudio produces the film and writes the script for it.
Jennifer Garner and Nick Nolte will join Russell Brand and Helen Mirren in the remake of the comedy Arthur
"I wanted to bring more power to the female character to reflect the state of things in China," Chen says.
"Chinese women nowadays run big business and win Olympic gold.
Gong Lee embodies this power."
For the second time in a row, you play an imaginary character.
Is it a coincidence?
Regularity.
I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I present two films here (at Kinotavr and the Sochi Film Market - EMRBE).
And in both of them I play a dream woman.
But... This is how the director saw me, this is how he introduced me, and many people probably think that I am like this in life.
Dream girl.
Your partner in the film, Alexander Yatsenko, is completely different from his hero.
How did you find a common language? What is it like on the set?
It is absolutely not what it seems at first glance.
At first, I saw him and thought, "Yes... I won't just have to."
Probably, without human contact, sincere and real, we would not have succeeded.
And this contact happened just a few minutes after we met.
We have become great friends, I am not afraid of this word.
I told him about all my fears, about all my worries, about the fact that I was afraid that I would not succeed, and asked him for some advice and help, and he gladly gave me this advice and this help.
We talked a lot...
I tried to do this because I was very afraid of losing this contact, of losing our mutual understanding.
And therefore, at the premiere, we watched the entire film holding hands.
How was the filming in Sevastopol?
Sevastopol is the city I came to for the first time.
I have never had a tour there, neither on vacation, nor as a child, I did not come there.
This city has a special magic, some kind of its own character, its own charisma.
And this is a city to which you want to return.
He has his own provincial charm.
A place where no one is in a hurry and always has time for everything.
It turns out that it was not difficult for you to play falling in love with this city.
In general, you are extremely organic on the screen, which, frankly speaking, many did not expect.
How do you work with roles?
Are emotional scenes easy for you?
You know, I'm not a professional actor.
And I am a very, by nature, trusting person.
If I came and agreed to work with the director, then I, in fact, trust in his hands and I want to be the dough from which they will sculpt.
I understand perfectly well that it is more visible from the outside, and I, again, ask for hints and talk to the director for a very long time, not even I talk to him, but he conducts preliminary conversations with me and explains very clearly and precisely what he needs.
And then, after long, hours-long rehearsals, we come to the organics you are talking about.
And how did you work with the director of the film Klim Shipenko?
I enjoyed everyone, the cameraman, director, producer, Sasha Yatsenko.
Because it is so pleasant for me to work with crazy people!
I saw the same thing when I worked with Timur Bekmambetov.
He was ready not to sleep, not to eat - and here was exactly the situation.
Not to sleep, not to eat for days - and all the same, even thunder, even hail.
And if something didn't work out, it was a disaster, and something had to be done urgently to make it work.
In this atmosphere of madness, it is very easy to work.
And it seems to me that when people are so shifted to a morbid fanaticism about what they do, it can't help but work, because too much energy is expended.
What scenarios do you abandon?
What are the criteria for selecting the material you will work with?
I don't want stupid things, stupid dialogues, films that don't say anything, don't carry anything.
I don't want to work just to appear on the screen once again.
Do you have any proposals, projects that you are going to work on in the near future?
There are no specific proposals and plans now.
I'm not the kind of person who writes charts.
The script came, it interested me, today this premiere happened.

While we are working on the November issue, film festivals are almost non-stop going on in Moscow: American cinema - "Amfest", "2toggo\", "2-t-1" will begin in a few days, followed by the festival of British cinema.
And here's what's interesting: half of my acquaintances constantly discuss that someone should be boycotted, and someone should be supported, for some - well, sorry - very vague reasons.
At the same time, when one of these festivals solemnly closes with a terrifying-looking Chu4 projection without English subtitles, no one seems to notice anything.
The last thing you want to grumble about is this, but if you, having bought a ticket for money, stay in the hall to look at the giant pixels and horizontal figures of the actors, then they will show them to you.
And in the issue, meanwhile, we have no pixels: "Tron: Legacy" (a sequel to the classic picture about virtual reality), "Let Me In. The Saga (an American remake of a beautiful Swedish film), Ungovernable (another Tony Scott's take on the topic of trains) and a wildly detailed account of how the films about Conan, the barbarian, the destroyer and the governor were made.

A multi-part fairy tale about a cute sorcerer-bespectacled is nearing completion.
And even though fans of the series have long read the book and know how it will end, and those for whom the word "Expelliarmus" does not mean anything will remain at home, the title of the main blockbuster of November for Harry is actually booked.

SOCIAL NETWORK
History of Facebook
David Fincher's new film is, first of all, a story about paradox.
The film tells the story of the invention of Facebook, one of the pioneering tools in the field of the Internet, which united the whole world, quarreled five friends and made its creator - 26-year-old former Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg - the youngest billionaire of recent decades.
Jesse Eisenberg in the title role is just as brilliant as our conflicted genius, an emotionally isolated social exile with an unpredictable set of motivations and attachments.
Zuckerberg is launching the site for a variety of reasons: partly out of anger at the world around him, partly out of sporting interest, and partly just because IT is "cool."
The idea itself and its implementation may seem spontaneous and spontaneous, but the actual course of events hints at a clear calculation and a well-thought-out business plan.
The strengths of The Social Network become evident from the first frames, especially in the scene before the opening credits, where Zuckerberg is talking in a bar with his ex-girlfriend Erika (Mara): the sonorous, tough dialogues of screenwriter Aaron Sorkin gain strength here and do not soften until the very end.
The same goes for Fincher's direction: relatively restrained (with the exception of the Winklevoss twins, the actors were different from each other.
The face of one of them was superimposed on the other with the help of computer graphics.
At the same time as Zuckerberg, Natalie Portman studied at Harvard.
Rooney Mara got the lead role in Fincher's next film, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
DIRECTOR: David Fincher
CAST: Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield, Rooney Mara, Justin Timberlake, Ermy Hammer, Joshua Pence
SYNOPSIS: Gloomy and introverted Harvard student Mark Zuckerberg, having received a turn from the gate on the personal front, takes on the ambitious task of creating a fundamentally new social network.
As Facebook's popularity grows, relationships with a few companion friends begin to fall apart and eventually lead to lawsuits.
The color palette plays its role: warm, sometimes sunny, even in the dark remaining cozy, it maneuvers between two tangled chains of events and two separate litigations.
Outside of the flow of incessant discussions, there is not much going on in the film: not a single death, not a single murder, and all of Zuckerberg's legal troubles are unlikely to be worth at least an additional paragraph for his meager Wikipedia page.
What attracted 49-year-old Sorkin and 48-year-old Fincher in this not too generous story?
After watching, there is a strong feeling that "The Social Network" is a portrait of our time, and understatement in this case is an important artistic device.
Only twenty years ago, Wall Street was doing much the same thing, only on a larger scale, with cosmic egos and big things.
Now that daily solvency has become even higher, politics is no longer carried out at board meetings, but in sandboxes.
Zuckerberg wants to be special, dreams of becoming the center of attention.
Severin (Garfield) is hurt that his best friend has a new best friend (Timberlake) and now he has no one to play with.
The Winklevosses (Hammer and Pence), meanwhile, are stomping their feet: who said that the rich, beautiful and athletic cannot also be smart?
(This line particularly amuses Fincher.)
If desired, the "Social Network" could well turn out to be a black comedy.
Zuckerberg is obsessed with the idea of popularity and leadership, but what is more about his business - positive or negative?
And what are the social consequences of his invention?
Is he a swindler?
Or a cunning manipulator?
Fincher and Sorkin will never close the book if there is even the slightest hint of something like this in it.
But you don't even have to do it here: in their version of history, it doesn't matter at all.
"How does it feel to feel beautiful?" asks Tre WeaNez's song "WaBu Uots'te A Vsp Map," which precedes the credits.
The hero does not know.
The film suggests the answer.
Zuckerberg is part of a lost online generation that has little idea of beauty and even less of feelings.
A tastefully made character drama about a high-profile trial of the Internet era
At the beginning of the XVII century, when Ivan Susanin lived, surnames of people of humble origin had not yet really begun to appear.
They made do with the name "so-and-so, so-and-so son".
That is, patronyms were in use - nicknames from the father.
But sometimes, for example, in the case of remarriages of the father, a matronym was used - a nickname after the mother's name.
Susanin is just such a case: "Ivan, son of Susanna".
The serfs of small landowners really did without surnames for a long time - why do you need it, when you have 20 souls and everything is constantly in sight.
But the owners of estates of many thousands were forced to give their peasants surnames.
Thus, the serfs of Prince Andrei Cherkassky already at the beginning of the XVIII century had surnames without exception.
In the XIX century, even small landowners did not keep a peasant on the land, but let him go on rent - let him earn money by craft and pay the owner.
Such a peasant was entitled to a passport, where the surname had to be entered.
By the abolition of serfdom in Central Russia, 55% of the serfs were released for rent.
This means that they already had surnames.
The capital's forensic experts arrived to investigate the explosion in Novosibirsk
Forensic experts of the central office and employees of the forensic center arrived in Novosibirsk to help with the investigation of the case of a gas explosion in a house on Lineynaya, 39, the NGS reports.
According to the investigation, the accused, Irina Urbakh and Yevgeny Kavun, introducing themselves as employees of the fictitious organization Mezhregiongaz, examined and repaired gas equipment.
They used low-quality spare parts, worked inaccurately, and inflated the prices for their services, on the contrary, the agency reports, citing an informed source.
On the eve of the tragedy on Lineynaya Street, a man and a woman visited three apartments of house No 39, where they changed the hoses of the stoves.
So, in one of the apartments, they put a water hose instead of a gas one.
Kavun, however, denies this.
According to him, this is impossible, everything was certified.
As a result of their actions, there was a leak and an explosion of a gas-air mixture in one of the apartments.
Two entrances collapsed - one completely, the second partially.
This led to a significant collapse of the building, which killed 13 people.
Earlier, suspects were arrested in the case of the explosion of a house in Novosibirsk.
The scammers themselves came from Omsk.
In St. Petersburg, it was possible to avoid a sea surge flood
Arguments of the week.

Specialists were able to prevent flooding by closing the dam the day before.
On Friday, the threat of flooding increased sharply in St. Petersburg due to bad weather in the city.
The sea surge flood was prevented thanks to the timely closure of the dam.
The potential flood could be the 32nd in a row, according to the St. Petersburg edition of Neva.Today.
The water level reached 184 centimeters, but thanks to the closure of the gates in the Gulf of Finland, the water was kept at around 168 centimeters, which is only seven centimeters higher than the lower threshold of the level of dangerous flooding (from 161 to 210 centimeters).
Weather conditions were complicated by gusty winds, the speed of which sometimes reached 20-25 meters per second.
Now the dam has been reopened, the water level has dropped, and ships can again sail in the Gulf of Finland.
Note that the situation with the water level is monitored by ten meteorological stations on the eastern side of the Gulf of Finland.
This prevents flooding that may follow increased winds.
In Turkey, 8 people arrested in the case of defects in collapsed buildings
In the Turkish province of Sanliurfa, 8 people were arrested in connection with the discovery of construction defects in buildings collapsed as a result of the earthquake.
As Armenpress reports, Habertürk reports.
As a result of the earthquake registered in Turkey on February 6, more than 20 thousand people died.
The number of wounded exceeds 80 thousand.
It is noted that the earthquake is the strongest since 1939.
The 7.7 magnitude earthquake was followed by hundreds of aftershocks that were felt not only in 10 provinces of Turkey, but also in neighboring Syria.

Video caption: WW2 bomb explosion in Great Yarmouth is caught on camera
In England, in the port city of Great Yarmouth, on Friday, an air bomb from the Second World War exploded, which sappers tried to defuse.
A powerful explosion was heard tens of kilometers away, but there were no casualties.
Norfolk County Police announced that, although the explosion was unplanned, none of the military personnel involved in defusing the bomb were injured.
"The device detonated shortly after work began on its neutralization.
Fortunately, all the personnel are intact.
Departments have begun to assess the damage," Norfolk Assistant Chief of Police Nick Davison told reporters.
Local residents write on social networks that the explosion shook houses at a distance of 24 km.

Photo caption: The explosion happened contrary to the plans of the sappers, but there were no killed or wounded
A 250-kilogram bomb was found during construction work on the banks of the Yar River, at the mouth of which, on the North Sea, stands Great Yarmouth.
Before starting attempts to defuse the bomb, the sappers built a protective rampart of sand around it, and the cordon, inside which outsiders were not allowed, was set up at a distance of 200 meters.
At first, on Thursday, bomb technicians were going to cut off the fuse from the bomb with the help of a robot, but the attempt failed, and then they decided, according to the local press, to use the technique of "slow burning" of explosives.
In the process of this burning, the explosion occurred.
During World War II, the Nazis dropped hundreds of thousands of bombs on Britain.
In the eight-month intensive bombing campaign from the autumn of 1940 to the spring of 1941, known as "Blitz", 450,000 bombs were dropped on Britain.
Among Belarusian researchers, women make up almost 40%
In Belarus, the number of women among researchers is 38.9%, BelTA learned from Alesya Solovey, a researcher at the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences.
The proportion of women among candidates of sciences and doctors of sciences is also growing: among candidates of sciences women account for 41.1%, among doctors of sciences - 21%.
In all fields of science, with the exception of technical sciences, the proportion of women exceeded 50 per cent.
The most feminized area of scientific knowledge is the medical sciences, in which the proportion of women is 64.4 per cent.
Only in technical sciences do men predominate, women make up 26.7%.
In the National Academy of Sciences, the share of women among researchers is 49.1%, which is 10.2% more than in the country as a whole.
Among candidates of sciences, the proportion of women is 46%, among doctors of sciences - 20%.
More than half of the teaching staff in higher education institutions are women (57%).
Among the vice-rectors for scientific, educational and educational work, every third is a woman (31.8%), among deans - 38.7%, deputy deans - 44.6%, heads of departments - 42.5%.
Most women are among senior teachers and teachers - over 60%.
The proportion of women among associate professors in departments is also high (55.2%).
According to the republican monitoring of public opinion conducted by the Institute of Sociology of the National Academy of Sciences last year, the majority of Belarusians do not support gender stereotypes about women's opportunities in science.
63.5% (56.5% of men and 69% of women) disagree with the gender stereotype "science is a man's field of activity" to one degree or another.
More than half of the country's residents do not hold the opinion that a woman is less competent as a scientist - 66.1% (59% of men and 71.6% of women).
"The transformation of gender ideas about women's research competence in the mass consciousness contributes to the involvement of young women in science, the development of their creative potential, the formation of a successful role model of a woman scientist, including through the transfer of experience and the institution of mentoring," said Alesya Solovey.
On February 11, the International Day of Women and Girls in Science is celebrated annually.
The holiday was established to introduce women and girls to the field of science, encourage women to develop scientific careers and recognize the achievements of women in science.
According to UNESCO, women make up 30% of the total number of researchers in the world.
The likelihood of a further increase in the key rate is higher than its reduction
This statement was made by Bank of Russia Governor Elvira Nabiullina following a meeting of its Board of Directors on February 10, which decided to keep this rate at 7.50%.
The head of the regulator, in particular, noted that important changes have recently taken place.
On the one hand, the terms of foreign trade have noticeably worsened - the price of Russian oil has decreased.
On the other hand, the situation in the economy is developing better than the October forecast.
The shift in the structure of demand continues: consumption remains restrained, private investment slows down, but fiscal spending grows.
At the same time, pro-inflationary risks have generally increased.
"Therefore, this year the probability of raising the rate exceeds the probability of reducing it.
The expediency of changing the rate will be determined by the development of the situation," Nabiullina said.
In addition to the more pronounced impact of fiscal policy, she noted three risks.
First, a rapid unwinding of consumption in the face of elevated inflation expectations, if the factors that restrain consumer activity weaken.
Secondly, there is an increasing shortage of labor and a lag in the growth of labor productivity from the growth of wages.
And there are still risks of additional tightening of sanctions restrictions.
Speaking about the regulator's future decisions, the Governor of the Bank of Russia noted that, despite the previously noted strengthening of pro-inflationary factors, the inflation forecast for the current year remains at the level of 5-7%.
According to her, this may require a higher trajectory of the key rate than expected in October.
In the updated forecast of the Central Bank for this and next year, the ranges for the average key rate have been increased by half a percentage point, to 7.0-9.0% per annum for 2023 and 6.5-7.5% per annum for 2024.
"This does not exclude the possibility of a rate cut this year, but its probability and scale have decreased.
And on the contrary, the likelihood has increased that some rate hike may be needed in order for inflation to meet the target of close to 4% in 2024," the head of the Bank of Russia concluded.
The Bank of Russia has approved the requirements for the procedure for creating special closed-end mutual investment funds (UIFs) consisting of blocked foreign securities.
The regulator informs that such securities will be withdrawn from existing retail mutual funds.
This will make it possible to launch the management of the remaining liquid assets and resume operations with investment shares.
If a retail mutual fund contains more than 10% of blocked securities, then the management company must allocate them to a separate closed-end mutual fund by September 1, 2023.
Each shareholder will be given units of the new fund in an amount equal to the shares of the fixed fund.
It is also possible to change the status of the retail fund to a closed one.
For funds with a share of blocked securities of less than 10%, the new requirements are not mandatory.
But the management company has the right to allocate the blocked assets to a separate closed-end mutual fund.
In addition, a requirement is introduced to inform shareholders about the consequences of withdrawing blocked securities to a special mutual fund.
In the future, in the event of the sale of such securities, management companies are required to pay at least 90% of the proceeds to the owners of investment shares on a quarterly basis, the Bank of Russia said in a statement.
In addition to summing up the results of the industry, experts also gave a forecast for the current year.
According to the Center for Analytics and Expertise of Promsvyazbank, in 2022 in Russia, air transport passenger turnover decreased by 6.3%, and passenger traffic - by 14.2%.
The volume of passenger traffic amounted to 95.2 million people, and the passenger turnover was 228.0 billion passenger-kilometers.
International passenger traffic amounted to 17.2 million people, which is 26.7% lower than the level of the previous year, domestic transportation - 78.0 million people (-10.9%).
PSB analysts note that the relative stability of the industry was influenced by state support programs.
In 2022, a program to stimulate domestic tourism was in effect, for which 38.8 billion rubles were allocated.
Tourists could receive a partial refund for tours with flights prepared by the Federal Agency for Tourism.
Also, to ensure the availability of air transportation, several state support programs were implemented, including subsidizing the transportation of citizens, the development of regional transportation, etc., with a total budget of more than 27.5 billion rubles.
In the second quarter of 2022, the government decided to allocate an additional 100 billion rubles to airlines and increase Aeroflot's capitalization by 52.5 billion rubles.
"Despite the sanctions pressure on the Russian aviation industry, as a result of the development of domestic tourism and the opening of new international destinations, as well as the continuation of subsidies to the industry by the state (so far 25.3 billion rubles have been allocated) in 2023, passenger traffic, according to our estimates, will increase by 6.4%, to 101.2 million people (domestic passenger traffic will be 91.1 million people), according to the forecast of the Federal Air Transport Agency, up to 103.0 million people," PSB analysts share their forecasts.
Terrorist attack in Jerusalem, 6-year-old child killed
Two people, including a 6-year-old child, were victims of a terrorist attack in Jerusalem: a car crashed into a bus stop at high speed.
Six more people were injured.
The driver of the car was shot dead on the spot.
It was later revealed to be a 31-year-old Palestinian from East Jerusalem.
His actions were classified by law enforcement agencies as a terrorist attack, the terrorist's relatives were detained, and the house was sealed.
At the same time, according to Israeli media reports, the attacker had mental problems, only this week he was discharged from the hospital.
Austria is again tightening control on the border with Hungary after another influx of migrants in recent months.
Officials say many people remain at the border in cars waiting to cross it to the Austrian side.
This thus sends a signal to the Austrian authorities that they have already been granted asylum in Hungary.
On the basis of existing arrangements, Austria considers that migrants are obliged to remain in the country where the request was made.
At the same time, the Austrian authorities consider it wrong to automatically send back to Hungary those wishing to cross the border: many migrants become victims of smugglers and find themselves between two border posts without the right to return to Hungary.
That is why, according to the police, increased control is required.
The decision to tighten checks by Vienna follows a pledge by European Union leaders to allocate more funds for cameras, drones and watchtowers to guard the commonwealth's borders.
According to the Frontex agency, last year the number of illegal migrants who arrived in the EU and applied for refugee status for the first time exceeded the figures of 2016 and amounted to more than 330 thousand.
Cargo Progress 83 successfully docked with the ISS
The Progress 83 robotic resupply vehicle successfully docked with the International Space Station on Saturday at 3.45 GMT, completing a two-day orbital flight.
The docking took place at an altitude of 269 statute miles above the South Pacific Ocean.
The docking was broadcast by NASA's Mission Control Center in Houston, Texas.
In Russia, the docking was controlled by specialists from the Mission Control Center.
From the ISS, the cargo ship was greeted by cosmonauts Sergei Prokopyev, Dmitry Petelin and Anna Kikina.
The Progress MS-22 spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS, including 720 kg of refueling fuel, 420 kg of water, as well as about 1,354 kg of dry cargo.
In addition, the ship delivered food for Russian cosmonauts.
Progress 83 was successfully launched from the Russian Baikonur cosmodrome on Thursday.
At the same time, Roscosmos reported the depressurization of Progress MS-21, prepared for undocking from the ISS and further sinking on February 18.
As specified in the press service of the company, the transfer hatch of the ship was immediately closed: Progress MS-21 was isolated from the total volume of the ISS.
The reasons for its depressurization are being investigated."
Also, the MCC reported that nothing threatens the ISS crew: "The temperature regime and pressure on board the station are normal.
Nothing threatens the life and health of the crew, they feel good."
"Cases of maternity tourism have become more frequent."
How pregnant Russian women got stuck in Argentina
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permits of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
Earlier, the authorities of the republic denied entry into the country to several pregnant Russian women, who were suspected of arriving for the purpose of "maternity tourism".
On February 11, they were nevertheless allowed to enter Argentina by a court decision.
More details - in the material "Gazeta. Ru".
The Argentine Migration Service has begun to suspend and cancel the residence permit (residence permit) of Russians who received it through the birth of a child, but did not stay in the country.
This was told to the C5N TV channel by the director of the service, Florencia Carignano.
"What we are doing is suspending the residence permits of those Russians who came to obtain a residence permit because their child is Argentine, but at the same time spent more time outside (Argentina) than inside (the country)," she explained.
According to her, when the court considers the issue of Argentine citizenship for a Russian, the migration service will submit data that the residence permit was suspended because this person "spent a month in Argentina and never came again."
Carignano warned that Russians who received a residence permit after the birth of a child and left may have it revoked.
Against this background, on February 9, it became known that three pregnant Russian women were "stuck" at the airport in Argentina due to the refusal to enter the country.
According to the head of the consular department of the Russian Embassy in Argentina, Georgy Polin, the diplomatic mission connects the incident with the fact that the authorities of the republic could consider the information provided by the girls at the entrance to be incomplete or false.
One of them arrived on February 7, two more on the evening of February 8, RIA Novosti reports.
The diplomat stressed that more pregnant women flew to Argentina, but these three were issued an order not to be allowed into the country.
"They were not allowed into the country in accordance with the law on migration, where one of the grounds for not being allowed into the country is the provision of incomplete, false, distorted information," Polin said.
On Saturday, February 11, the Argentine migration service, by court decision, allowed pregnant citizens of the Russian Federation to enter the country, lawyer Christian Rubilar said.
"An hour ago, they were all allowed to enter Argentina," TASS quoted him as saying.
Rubilar noted that the migration service changed its decision after the court ruling.
It is easier for foreign parents of a child born in Argentina to obtain a passport of the republic.
It allows short-term trips to 171 countries without visas, including the EU states, the UK and Japan, RBC notes.
In early January 2023, The Guardian newspaper wrote about the "boom in maternity tourism" to Argentina among Russians.
According to Polin, in 2022, from 2 thousand to 2.5 thousand citizens of the Russian Federation moved to the republic.
Many of them, the diplomat noted, are Russian women who are going to give birth there.
"In 2023, this number could grow to 10 thousand," he said.
In turn, Carignano previously claimed that in 2022 about 10.5 thousand Russian citizens arrived in Argentina, and in recent months - more than 5.8 thousand pregnant women.
On February 9, it became known how rental prices in St. Petersburg have changed.
It fell in price by 10%.
At the same time, it is known that throughout the country rent has become more expensive by 25%, reports the Patrol of St. Petersburg with reference to RBC.
The average monthly rent for an apartment in St. Petersburg at the beginning of 2023 was 27,000 rubles.
A one-room apartment cost 25,000 rubles per month, a studio - 22,000 rubles per month, a two-room apartment - 36,000 rubles per month.
Experts believe that this trend may change by spring, when many citizens who have been abroad will return home.
The reasons for the interrogation of women in a foreign country have become known.
The migration service of Argentina did not allow six pregnant Russian women into the country, since the purpose of the visit, which was indicated by them, turned out to be false.
This was reported by TASS with reference to the Todo Noticias TV channel.
For five hours, pregnant women were asked questions about the purpose of the visit.
Most of them admitted that they came to a foreign country to give birth.
In this regard, representatives of the country did not allow the Russians to enter Argentina.
As specified in the publication, the migration service has a procedure if there are suspicions of "false" travelers.
So, if it is noticeable that a woman is 33 weeks pregnant, she does not have a return ticket to Russia, and she cannot clearly tell where she will go on vacation, then she immediately becomes suspicious of the migration service.
Moreover, experts specify that it is difficult to be a traveler "in such conditions."

Kirkorov won a court case against a fisherman
In the lawsuit, the man stated the illegality of the artist's construction, but did not appear at the meeting.
Rybak sued music performer Philip Kirkorov over an allegedly illegally installed pier at his dacha near Moscow.
Writes about it "Channel Five".
Nevertheless, the Saratov fisherman failed to win the case.
The complaint against the singer was considered by the Odintsovo City Court. According to the lawyer, documents and design projects were presented in court, which confirmed the legality of all structures installed on the territory of the celebrity's house.
As the head of the law firm Alexander Dobrovinsky clarifies, the construction of the pier left the plaintiff no chance to go fishing.
The application for the performer was submitted on January 11.
The star lawyer jokingly said that, probably, the man planned to fish exclusively from the artist's house.
Ironically, Dobrovinsky clarified that he would ask Kirkorov to provide the plaintiff with his balcony for fishing.
He stressed that from that place it is possible to cast the spinning rod further.
Somnologist named the causes of sleep problems
Somnologist Sofia Cherkasova spoke about foods and habits that interfere with healthy sleep.
As the specialist noted, sleep problems often arise due to products containing caffeine.
We are talking primarily about tea, coffee, chocolate and any desserts containing cocoa.
Their use before bed should be limited, since they not only interfere with falling asleep, but also make sleep "torn", which means that it does not allow the body to fully recover.
According to the doctor, it is better to stop using caffeine-containing products 6-8 hours before bedtime.
Otherwise, they contribute to a decrease in the excitability threshold of the nervous system and, as a result, there are difficulties with falling asleep.
Alcohol also negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
The doctor clarifies that small doses of alcoholic beverages promote relaxation and do not affect sleep.
However, amounts exceeding 36 grams in terms of pure alcohol lead to various sleep disorders, such as light sleep and frequent nighttime awakenings.
In addition, to prevent problems with falling asleep, the somnologist recommends giving up spicy food in large portions.
Large amounts and spicy foods contribute to an increase in core body temperature, which negatively affects the ability to fall asleep.
For healthy sleep, it is necessary not only to observe the external temperature regime: the optimal air temperature is 18-20 degrees, but also the absence of increased body temperature.
According to Cherkasova, you should not abuse heavy food before going to bed, since it will not allow the body to fully recover and rest: it will be forced to spend energy on digestion.
The doctor also recalled that the lack of healthy sleep and accumulated lack of sleep affect the quality of life and usual activities, so it is extremely important to adhere to a sleep and rest schedule and allow the body to recover.

Hundreds of demonstrations against pension reform will be held in France on Saturday
The fourth day of mass protests against pension reform is being held by trade unions in France on Saturday.
Hundreds of demonstrations will take place across the country, according to French media.
After a slight decrease in the number of protesters last Tuesday compared to the first two "days of mobilization", the trade unions hope to bring a larger number of protesters to the streets this time, taking into account those citizens who did not have the opportunity to participate in demonstrations on a weekday.
Law enforcement agencies expect from 600 thousand to 800 thousand demonstrators across the country, including in Paris - from 90 thousand to 120 thousand, the media write.
On February 7, 757 thousand people took part in actions against the pension reform, according to the French Ministry of Internal Affairs.

Depressurization of Progress MS-21 occurred on the ISS: 12 February 2023, 00:12
TASS - KAZINFORM - Roscosmos reported on the depressurization of Progress MS-21, prepared for undocking from the ISS, Kazinform reports with reference to TASS.
"The contour of the Progress MS-21 transport cargo ship, the flooding of which is scheduled for February 18, is depressurized, confirmed the telemetry data received by the MCC," the press service of Roscosmos said.
As noted, at the moment it is isolated from the total volume of the station.
The causes of the incident are being investigated, it did not affect either the docking of the Progress MS-22 cargo spacecraft or the further ISS flight program.
The situation was commented on by Roscosmos Executive Director for Manned Space Programs Sergei Krikalev.
"On the cargo ship, which has been docked to the station for several months, there was a leak of coolant from the thermal control system.
The situation is somewhat similar to what happened to us with the spacecraft (Soyuz MS-22 - approx. TASS) in mid-December," he said, noting that the commission that analyzed the incident with the Soyuz concluded that the leak was caused by a micrometeoroid.
Roscosmos will conduct an analysis to make sure there are no problems with the next launches.
"We need to conduct an in-depth analysis to make sure that this reason does not apply to similar designs in future launches.
This is the most important task that will now face us," he said.
According to the executive director, it is necessary to conduct an analysis in terms of preparing the spacecraft for launch, the materials that were used, and the technologies that were used in the assembly of the radiator.
The same analysis was carried out in the case of the damaged radiator of the Soyuz MS-22 spacecraft.
"The most important thing is to make sure that this is not some kind of systematic error," Krikalev added.
The executive director clarified that on Saturday, a commission began its work, which will analyze all possible causes.
"The spacecraft was supposed to undock and descend from orbit two days before the launch of the Soyuz spacecraft (Soyuz MS-23 - approx. TASS), so there are serious consequences for the actions of the crew, for the work of the crew... From this point of view, this will not affect the program," Krikalev said.
The Progress MS-21 truck was launched from Baikonur on a Soyuz-2.1a launch vehicle on October 26.
Two days later, it docked with the Poisk small research module of the Russian segment of the ISS.
The spacecraft delivered more than 2,500 kg of cargo to the ISS.
NASA named the place of depressurization of Progress
Depressurization of the Progress MS-21 cargo spacecraft on the International Space Station (ISS) occurred in the thermal control system.
This was announced by a representative of the American Mission Control Center (MCC) during negotiations with the ISS crew, broadcast by NASA.
Now, according to NASA, the coolant leak from Progress has stopped.
NASA believes that all the refrigerant has completely come out.
"This morning we had a leak of refrigerant from the thermoregulation system into space, the leak of refrigerant stopped," said a representative of the American MCC (quoted by Interfax).
Earlier, due to depressurization, the Progress circuit was isolated.
Roscosmos reported that nothing threatens the cosmonauts.
Progress MS-22 docked with the ISS today, February 11, they will take it out of orbit, according to the plan, on February 18.
John Kirby, coordinator of strategic communications at the US National Security Council, refused to announce a possible trip by US President Joe Biden to Ukraine.

The Deputy General Director of Russian Railways invited the Governor of the Irkutsk Region to develop new sales areas
The Irkutsk region needs to continue to develop alternative sales directions, except for the Far East.
This is both the domestic market and the ports of the Western direction, including the Azov-Black Sea basin.
This proposal was made by Deputy General Director of Russian Railways Alexei Shilo at a meeting with Governor Igor Kobzev, the regional government reported on February 10, 2023.
- As the practice of last year has shown, even despite the geographical location of the Irkutsk region, this solution can be extremely effective.
It is important that the logistics services of companies constantly interact with our "subcontractors" (ports, operators, sea transport) and find optimal price conditions for the transportation of their products according to new schemes, - Alexey Shilo emphasized.
The Governor noted the importance of the stability of product shipments, the Irkutsk Region is one of the richest regions of the Russian Federation in mineral resources and has significant reserves of hard and brown coal.
About 25 enterprises are engaged in coal mining in the region.
The instability of exporting products has a negative impact on the financial and economic activities of coal mining companies.
Igor Kobzev also stressed that the Irkutsk region is an export-oriented region, so it is necessary to increase the size of monthly quotas for the transportation of timber and metallurgical products produced in the region to a level that ensures the stable operation of such enterprises.
"Understanding the importance of the Irkutsk region as an industrial center, we, for our part, will try to do everything to support the volume of transportation.
If there are additional volumes of shipments to the domestic market, then we are also ready to provide assistance in this direction," said Alexey Shilo.

The cost of all work is more than 80 million rubles.
Repairs are in the final stage, problems with connecting to power grids - an increase in capacity is needed, work is underway with an energy supply organization.
In addition, in Granovshchina and in Khomutovo, Konstantin Zaitsev held a meeting with citizens, some of whom were sold houses illegally connected to the power grid.
It was decided that the grid company will organize a personal reception next week for the legal settlement of these issues.
- Very often, the issue of stable electricity supply is the main condition when buying a house, because the population is increasingly using electricity for heating.
Therefore, sellers sometimes arbitrarily connect houses to nearby networks, and this is already the basis for disconnecting the power supply.
Therefore, now grid companies in those areas where active construction is underway should pay special attention to this issue," Konstantin Zaitsev emphasized.

Agricultural producers of the district fulfill this role with honor," Anatoly Prokopyev emphasized.
The crossing on the Armenian-Turkish border was opened for the first time in decades for the delivery of humanitarian aid
The Margara-Alijan border checkpoint on the border of Turkey and Armenia was opened for the first time in three decades to deliver humanitarian aid to earthquake victims.
Turkish and Armenian media write about this.
The same crossing was used to deliver humanitarian aid from Turkey to Armenia after the devastating earthquake of 1988, the Turkish Anadolu Agency notes.
On Saturday, Armenia sent five trucks with 100 tons of food, medicines, water and other emergency aid packages to the city of Adiyaman in southern Turkey, Ankara's special representative for the Armenian-Turkish talks Serdar Kılıç said.
He expressed gratitude to Deputy Speaker of the Armenian Parliament Ruben Rubinyan and Deputy Foreign Minister of Armenia Vahan Kostanyan.
"I will always remember the help sent by the people of Armenia to alleviate the suffering of our people in the earthquake-affected region," Kılıç wrote on his Twitter page.
Armenian Foreign Ministry spokesman Vahan Hunanyan, in turn, said that trucks with humanitarian aid crossed the border through the Margara Bridge and are heading to the earthquake-affected region.
According to Public Radio of Armenia, the last time a car crossed the Margar Bridge was 30 years ago, in 1993.
Since then, the Armenian-Turkish land border has been closed.
The Turkish Anadolu Agency provides other data and writes that the Margara-Alijan border checkpoint was last used to deliver humanitarian goods to Armenia to eliminate the consequences of the devastating earthquake of 1988.
Then aid collected through the Turkish Red Crescent was delivered to the disaster zone in Armenia.
Earlier, Armenia sent 27 rescuers to Turkey and another 29 rescuers to Syria in the areas affected by the earthquake.
According to the latest data, more than 25 thousand people died in Turkey and Syria from the devastating earthquake that occurred on Monday.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on February 11 that 21,848 people were already known to have died in Turkey.
On the Syrian side, 3553 dead were reported.
Relations between Turkey and Armenia are clouded mainly by the fact that Ankara refuses to recognize the Armenian genocide in the Ottoman Empire, and also supported Baku during the First and Second Karabakh Wars.
Recently, Yerevan and Ankara have made a number of attempts to normalize relations.
In 2021, Armenia and Turkey appointed special representatives who met several times in Vienna to discuss normalization issues.
In February 2022, commercial flights between Yerevan and Istanbul resumed after a two-year break.
In July 2022, Ankara and Yerevan agreed on the possibility of opening the land border for third-country nationals as soon as possible.

If you need him to play in the Makelele position, then he can play very well there.

A tanker with diesel from a vessel that previously sailed under the Russian flag was not allowed into the port of Spain
The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of the Merchant Marine under the Spanish Ministry of Transport has banned the Maersk Magellan vessel from entering the city's port to unload diesel fuel, since the cargo comes from the Nobel vessel, which until July 1, 2022 sailed under the Russian flag, the Spanish Ministry of Transport said.
"The Tarragona Maritime Command of the General Directorate of Merchant Marine under the Ministry of Transport, Mobility and Urban Development has banned entry into the port of Tarragona to unload diesel fuel on the Maersk Magellan vessel under the flag of Singapore, because the cargo it carries comes from the Cameroonian-flagged vessel Nobel, which sailed under the Russian flag until July 1, 2022," the ministry said in a statement.
The measure was taken in accordance with EU law, which prohibits access for any vessel registered under the Russian flag since April 16, 2022 or reflagged after February 24, 2022.
The ministry clarified that the inspection was carried out on February 9, after which a ban was agreed.
The ministry recalled that this is not the first time that ships are banned from entering Spanish ports.
In April 2022, the port of Barcelona denied access to the ship Black Star under the Maltese flag, which was transporting cargo from a vessel under the Russian flag.
In 2022, after the strengthening of anti-Russian sanctions, the EU, the United States and the United Kingdom imposed restrictions on the supply of Russian petroleum products, and then decided to limit fuel prices.

The problems that pregnant Russian women had with entering Argentina explained
According to the expert, against the backdrop of the influx of those wishing to give birth to a child in Argentina, the country's authorities began to monitor the entry of foreign citizens into their territory more closely.
Difficulties with the entry of pregnant Russian women into Argentina are due to the fact that the country's authorities are not interested in a massive influx of foreigners who want to obtain citizenship for their children and a residence permit for themselves, and then leave.
This is reported by Lenta.ru with reference to St. Petersburg State University Professor Viktor Heifetz, editor-in-chief of the Latin America magazine.
According to him, no country supports such a practice.
He noted that Argentina does not approve of turning the country into a transshipment point, and not into a final one.
This applies to those who violate constitutional practice.
As the expert explained, the child will retain Argentine citizenship, but the decision to provide an Argentine passport to parents after obtaining a residence permit will be made by the court.
If it turns out that they did not actually live in Argentina and immediately left, citizenship may be refused.
This applies not only to Russians, but also to citizens of other countries.
Recently, as the specialist pointed out, maternity tours to Argentina are especially popular among Russians and Ukrainians.
Recall that Argentina grants citizenship by the "right of soil", that is, if a person was born on its territory.
An Argentine passport opens up the possibility of visa-free visits to 170 countries, including the EU states and the UK.
Earlier it was reported that Argentina began to revoke the residence permits of Russians who received a document through the birth of a child, but left the country.
Buenos Aires is interested in reducing such cases.
It also became known that six pregnant Russian citizens were denied entry to Argentina due to suspicion of providing false data on the motives for the trip.
Hundreds of new fitness clubs are predicted to open in Russia
In Russia, citizens' interest in fitness services is recovering, which allows market participants to expand their business.
This year, more than 400 new facilities, mainly small-format, may open in the country.
About 400 new fitness clubs may open in Russia, their total number may increase by 5 percent.
According to Kommersant, at the same time, several dozen players may leave the Russian market.
By the end of the year, there will be about 8.6 thousand clubs in Russia.
According to the publication, most of the new clubs are small-format projects with small initial investments and a quick payback.
Such data are provided by representatives of the National Fitness Community.
Olga Kiseleva, President of the Association of Fitness Industry Operators, in an interview with the publication, noted that 340-420 new fitness clubs will be small, the rest will occupy an area of more than 500 square meters.
The President of the NFS, Elena Silina, noted that since 2020, there have been more club closures than openings every year.
Over the past three years, their number has decreased by 37 percent.
At the same time, independent analysts cite other figures.
According to Kontur.Focus, over the past three years, the number of organizations with the main activity "work of a fitness center" has increased by 10.1 percent, and now there are 5.12 thousand of them.
The industry suffered heavy losses due to the pandemic, but back in 2021 it began to recover.
According to 2GIS, there are 4.5 thousand fitness clubs in Russian cities with a population of over one million.
Russians began to pay more attention to physical activity, as evidenced by the increase in attendance at fitness clubs.
At the end of January 2023, attendance increased by 9.3 percent year-on-year.
As Silina noted, if the trend is maintained, then by the end of the year the industry will return to pre-crisis levels.
The license of the management company from Kirov was taken away
The Arbitration Court of the Kirov Region annulled the license for entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings, issued to the management company "Zabota".
In the Kirov region, by decision of the regional Arbitration Court, the license for entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings, previously issued to the management company "Zabota", was canceled.
According to the regional State Housing Inspectorate, the court decision was made back in November 2022, but came into force only in February 2023.
The arbitration revoked the license of the "manager" for the fact that the organization several times ignored the instructions of the State Housing Inspectorate.
Currently, all objects that were under the management of "Zabota" have been excluded from the register of licenses for entrepreneurial activities in the management of apartment buildings.
Their total area was 64.8 thousand square meters.
All houses are located in the regional center.
The Kirov administration knows that they were left without a management company.
In accordance with the requirements of Russian legislation, the State Housing Inspectorate informed the mayor's office about the situation.
Recall that in January 2023, the Governor of the Kirov Region, Alexander Sokolov, set the State Housing Inspectorate the task of liquidating 2/3 of the region's management companies by spring, since there are too many of them.
The legality of the governor's demands raised doubts among the Kirov communists.
They appealed to the regional prosecutor's office and asked to bring Sokolov to administrative responsibility.
Presumably, the same position could be taken in the Federal Antimonopoly Service.
The antimonopoly officers allegedly also asked the prosecutor's office to check the legality of the actions of the head of the region.

Delicious coffee, a large selection of syrups and alternative milk.
Delicious fresh pastries😍😍😍.
Hearty sandwiches.
Comfortable cafeteria area
We came with my daughter to apply for a pension.
They received me cordially, explained everything clearly, scanned the documents, filled out an application, told me how to make an appointment for subsequent appointments.
At the entrance, the administrator and security meet in a polite and respectful manner.
The building is decent, everything is equipped for people - there is a hall, a toilet, although a cooler with water would not hurt to buy more.
We came 2 times, everything is fine!
I wish all employees peace, goodness, good luck and a decent salary, in this difficult time for everyone!!
Just a great place!
After a long walk on the beach, there's nothing better than sitting by the window with a cup of mulled wine while waiting for a scallop salad (which tastes simply incomparable!!)
I highly recommend this wonderful place !!)))
A nice cashier asked me to take me with her or in the hall to make me coffee, 200 or 300 ml.
I asked in the hall, 300 ml.
After a couple of minutes, they give me a plastic cup.
I wanted to be in ceramics, that's why "in the hall".
They did it to me.
I ask why in a cup and not in a cup.
The girl answers, they say, they do not have cups with a volume of 300 ml.
Is this how it fits in a person's head?
Ask yourself or in the hall, i.e. determine the technology for yourself: pour coffee into a cup or into a disposable cup.
Get the answer - in the hall, i.e. in a cup.
Clarify the volume.
Hear that 300 ml.
To confront a person with the fact that there are no cups of this volume.
Here, they say, is a paper cup, 300 ml.
It is noteworthy that this is the third such case in Zelena Okolitsa in my memory.
It is doubly remarkable that I was not offered a standard cup so that I could pour the contents of a plastic cup into it and drink coffee the way I wanted. I asked for it myself.
A number of questions arise.
1. Are the cafeteria of Zelena Okolitsa and Zelena Okolitsa sides of the same coin or organizations that are not connected with each other in any way?
If they are not related, understanding appears.
If related - why did a food and trade enterprise, known in the city for its service and quality, condescend to the rhetoric of a stall at the Kazan railway station?
Rhetoric because such a case, I repeat, has happened to me for the third time.
I do not rule out that it is not only me who is happening.
2. Does the cashier have instructions?
I got the impression that she was acting on a hunch.
I hope I'm wrong.
Please write down the actions for your employees in this case, if you are trying to go to the service.
We really like the circus, we have been going there since our childhood.
I saw the numbers with Nikulin Y.
And now with children and nephews.
I like the atmosphere in the circus, as well as the programs.
The location of the seats is very convenient.
From almost any point you can see the arena and the backs of those sitting in front do not interfere with you.
The circus is very chamber, family-friendly!
this time we went to the New Year's program.
We were a little upset.
There are many clowns and acrobats.
I would like a number with tricks and more animals.
It's a pity that now you can't take pictures with animals in the lobby.
But apparently there are reasons for this.
And in general, a very pleasant place!!
I wish you prosperity and delight us with your performances!!
I liked the developer Otdelstroy, he chooses good places for the construction of residential complexes.
They use high-quality materials, which fully justifies the price.
Before buying, we were invited to see the complex, when there were not even walls yet, so that we could see everything live, although we looked at so many apartments and not a single developer offered us this.
Russia's favorite ski resort!
The coolest thing is the gentle sparse forests of e, especially when there is a lot of soft snow.
But the tracks, as for me, are boring and short.
The longest ones are in sector e, there are even less so.
But in general, a great atmosphere, many different cafes and bars, so a fun ski mood is guaranteed!
Excellent master Peri!
I did everything as quickly and efficiently as possible, the cabin is clean and pleasant.
Good service, friendly staff, there is a wardrobe and water.
Disgusting service.
The second time I come to pick up the order at the time of readiness, which is indicated in the application, and wait at the windowsill for more than 30 minutes for my order.
Such a service is unacceptable in business today!
The response of the "care" service is that we try.
At the checkout, even without apologies, just - we are not to blame, this is the program.
Neither call nor warn, you did not find any other technical opportunities to communicate with regular previously loyal customers.
Impotent people are "trying", but the business must work.
Thank you all, we all disperse.
We will not order more from you and even more so recommend.
Spoiled mood, waiting for guests, apologies from the hostess are not the best sauce for hot rolls.
I ordered a car (Jeep Wrangler Sahara) through the organization.
I expected to receive the car in 3-3.5 months (as agreed), but the fact turned out to be 4.5 months - the delay was caused by the situation on the border of Lithuania with Belarus (Lithuania was complying).
As a result, I am very pleased with the car, thanks to the guys - Dmitry, Stas, Alexander - always in touch, up-to-date information, professional advice and normal human attitude.
Thank you again!
We rented a house for 4 days for 3 people.
The houses are clean, cozy, warm (even very), the house has its own small kitchen with coffee, tea, sugar, spices, sunflower oil, all the necessary utensils.
Detergent and sponge are available.
Of the disadvantages, only too little space can be distinguished, there is a terribly small shower in the bathroom.
There is no place to store snowboards or skis, and there is not much place to dry things, so I had to take a dryer from the owners and cram it instead of a chair, and put a heater under it.
And so in general, a good option in a quiet place.
Stylish, clean, spacious.
The food is delicious, the choice of dishes is sufficient for the needs of any guest.
Prices are reasonable.
There are wines and beer for those who want to drink.
The center of Moscow, I recommend
Wonderful place with very polite staff, will definitely come again.
The territory has all the necessary amenities, including parking and billiards.
The rooms are well renovated and have all the amenities.
A beautiful and aesthetic place, we walked during a visit to Kaliningrad.
I really liked it, and Russia in miniature, and Ozerov Park and the landscape.
In winter, there are a lot of slides natural for children)
Very cool tobacco and hookah store)
We constantly shop here, the prices are low, and the quality is at the level!
Very responsive staff, will prompt and answer all your questions)
I recommend this store to everyone to visit! ❤️
The location is convenient for anyone.
For me personally, it's normal.
They serve quickly, if one of the visitors is not stupid.
It is convenient to make an appointment.
The staff is attentive, they will prompt, direct, advise even if they did not come on reception days.
In principle, it's fine.
Great guys!
Thank you very much!
Everything was done quickly and promptly, the prices are adequate compared to other services.
I thought the remote control was thrown away, but they did everything to me so smart.
Many thanks to the young guys!
I ordered a bouquet of 21 tulips with delivery of 2 hours on March 8.
They brought flowers in a package after 6 hours, as if they had been stolen (barely enough paper to wrap the flowers).
Then, when the flowers were already in the vase, I realized that something was wrong.
I compared it with the photo on the site and the color turned out to be completely different from what I ordered.
I decided to count and it turned out that there were an even number of 20 tulips.
Support in WhatsApp responded to my indignation about the color and the number of colors "apparently they mixed up the color."
The next day I wrote again and I was offered a 15% refund.
It seems to me that this is an extreme degree of impudence and most likely falls under the definition of fraud.
I have already sent an application to the tax office about the fact that they refused to issue me a check.
Next in line are Rospotrebnadzor and the court.
I do not recommend anyone to contact this organization.
For more than 10 years I have been going to the master Samira, for coloring and cutting hair.
I want to cancel the Professionalism of the master Samira, she does her job perfectly, I am always satisfied with her work.
She always listens carefully to the wishes of the client, and the client is always satisfied with the result.
I boldly recommend this master to all family and friends.
All her works are always done at the highest level !!'
A huge rescue to Master Samira 😍
Greetings to this gaming club, I can say the prices are excellent, there are a lot of gaming computers, there are also drinks and food.
Of the minuses, some keyboards are broken, the buttons fly off, if you take the "normal gameplay", then the computers do not pull well :(
Therefore, the rating is 4🥸
This place has become our family tradition)
The son goes to study in his group, and the mother goes to the fitbox in the evening.
The administrators are super-attentive, the trainers are professional.
They arrange themed holidays for children, monitor cleanliness and exercise equipment.
It's nice to walk and study.
A 6-year-old child already takes a blow well, strong GPP.
Recommended to children, moms and dads)
The best masters!
Irina is just gold!!
She does the work efficiently, caring, clarifies everything.
You can always talk to girls about something!
The third time was !
I will never regret it!
Finally, I can grow my hair after bleaching !!
Vita also studies coloristics.
Therefore, it is she who will soon be able to combine blones with keratin!
And your hair will say THANK YOU🥰🥰 to you
Master receptionist Elena Polyanskaya is a very responsive master, she explained clearly everything that is included in the routine maintenance.
Also, during the repair of my car, she provided all kinds of assistance.
And also thanks to the master Valery Ushakov for the attentive and professional conduct of work.
He was ready to answer any question.
The work was carried out with high quality.
The only thing that confused me when signing up for maintenance was insufficiently correct information on the work regulations, when appearing for maintenance, the regulations were more clearly explained.
I want to express my deep gratitude to the staff of the Administration.
A very rare certificate was needed for the guardianship authorities to approve a real estate transaction, the employees were very friendly and helped to issue this certificate, although they could have refused, since this is not part of their duties.
Thank you very much!
Very sincere people work here.
Wonderful, sincere, polite employees, I did not regret that I came to this hairdresser! 👍
Master Nahida made impeccable highlights, haircuts, took into account and understood all my wishes, I definitely recommend❤️ it to everyone
I really liked the Nizhny Novgorod Kremlin.
Restored for the 800th anniversary, everything is stylish and clean inside.
There are also cafes and toilets for tourists.
I went on an excursion, also great.
And I definitely recommend the Russian building of the Nizhny Novgorod Art Museum - an unexpectedly beautiful collection
We have known Olya for more than 3 years, we use the services regularly.
During this time, we saw how Olya develops in her favorite business, constantly learns new things and expands the space for four-legged animals, which only causes admiration and trust.
We always leave our dog with peace of mind.
Daily video reports, if necessary, they will pick up / take away by pet taxi.
And they will also bring clean and delicious)
In general, a 🥰 fairy tale
Thank you for your care and attentive personal attitude to our pets 🐕💜
The Sytyi Los restaurant is located near the Medvedkovo metro station.
The restaurant is very cozy!
Delicious dishes are prepared.
The menu is varied.
It is advisable to book in advance before visiting, especially on Fridays!
Cute well-groomed zoo.
Smaller than Moscow, but just as interesting and convenient.
We were on weekdays - the entrance for an adult is 300 rubles, a schoolchild is 170.
There were few people, we walked with pleasure, looked at the animals.
The anteater impressed)
in Moscow, by the way, he was not seen.
On the territory there are a couple of cafes with reasonable prices, the toilet is clean free, we also saw a phone charging station.
In general, I recommend 👍 it
The interior is at the highest level!!
I am very pleased with the services of the cosmetologist Kuznetsova Natalia, I go only to her.
I do various facial cleansing - both hardware and mechanical.
I am 100% satisfied.
A master of his craft👍
Everything tells in detail about the features of the skin, she selected cosmetics that care for my skin type, just perfect.
Now I walk happy and beautiful!!
Thanks to Natalia!!
A great club with a huge space, a swimming pool, a sauna, a hammam and great trainers!
Of the minuses, a huge number of pensioners in the pool and in the locker room area.
It feels like they come to the club as if they were in a public bathhouse!
Special emphasis on the women's section.
On weekdays, starting at 19:00, there are a lot of people!
I give a C and then only thanks to the first visit, when I got to the consultant, if I'm not mistaken Timur, but I may be wrong.
He issued everything quickly, told everything +/-, everything is clear, the son also decided to issue a card, and alas, the consultants are busy with their own affairs, the clients are waiting, the consultant approached the son in the end, who doesn't care about everything, several times he looked 6 into the meeting room, discussing something cheerfully, as a result, the son left without formalizing anything, the consultant said for forgiveness, well, you don't want to do what you want, since I was present at this meeting,  I was surprised.
A new office, in a new format, everything is comfortable and such an attitude.
It's a pity that the first impression was crossed out, now we visit another branch, and there the attitude towards customers does not depend on the change of employees.
The choice is very large, the quality is good (the fabric is resistant to pilling), the staff knows their assortment, they help in choosing styles.
You can dress both a slim woman and a child with a non-standard figure and height.
They are located near the metro, there is even a small parking lot.
Recommend!
I was in September, celebrating my birthday.
In principle, I liked everything in terms of service and quality of food: prices are low, portions are medium-sized, so you can eat enough, or order again.
The only complaint is the reservation of a table.
When I ordered, I indicated the number and everything that was required, after which the bot instantly called to check the phone.
Then nothing.
When I came to the restaurant itself, it turned out that the table was not booked.
We were lucky that there were free places and we were able to accommodate.
And so, in fact, a very good restaurant with an excellent price/quality ratio.
Recommend!
I went for a purge on the recent weekend.
For the first time I see such an organized staff who reacted as reverently as possible to many of my questions, suggested how and what is better to do for further treatment of the dental cavity.
I heartily recommend, the only clinic where they do not want to heat for money in my memory.
Nice shopping center.
There is everything!
A large assortment of goods.
Variety of shops.
You can always find a product to your liking.
From food to gifts.
Not a foot in this store again.
We bought a washing machine, they said that we are out of town, so we will take it ourselves.
The manager in the hall said where to drive to the warehouse, to the question "will they load"? He said yes. ))
In the warehouse they took it out without a box, to the question why? They replied that this is how everything is loaded.
When I began to insist, they put two strips of foam, like it will do!
They refused to load it into a trailer, they say it's not their job, load it yourself, they have delivery)))
When I said that then I would refuse the order altogether, they said "yes, as you want, we don't care", as a result, one still condescended to go down the ramp and help my father stuff the car into the trailer.
This is the first time I encounter such boorish service.
Good shopping center Cleanly neat.large selection of shops and cafes with restaurants.
There is a cinema "Cosmik", an entertainment children's center "Nevidalia".
On the ground floor there is a large Lenta Hypermarket.
Convenient, large parking convenient location.
A good supermarket for cosmetics, underwear and household goods.
A diverse assortment, reasonable prices, polite, attentive staff.
Consultants will definitely help with the choice, advise.
Everyone will find something for themselves.
A good place to spend an evening.
The staff is very good, a nice place.
I advise everyone never to make a mistake in your choice.The best institution in Krasnodar where you can relax and everything will go super.
I advise you to visit)
We would like to thank Marina Sentinel, who was our funeral agent.
Having come to us on call, she took care of all the issues related to this difficult and sad event, helped us choose everything we needed, was always in touch and informed us how things were going.
Thanks to her, we saw off a loved one with dignity.
Everything was formalized, clearly organized, as we discussed at the first meeting.
Marina, perfectly understanding the state of her loved ones, gave advice on how it would be better and simply sympathized with us in a human way.
He is a very good specialist in his field.
Thank you for everything.
Flattered by the many good reviews, I turned to "RemStirMash" and I was assigned master Alexander.
He began the conversation by saying that the next day he was completely free and ready for service.
Everything was discussed and the time was appointed - 14.00.
The next day came - a call in the morning from the master and a statement that he would not be able to come, a difficult application (how is it? and where is "completely free?") and, if he can, then instead of the appointed 14.00 he will appear after 18.00.
We agreed again the next day.
15 minutes before the appointed time, another master calls and says that he can come instead of Alexander, but in 2 hours.
What kind of tricks are these?
A day and a half of empty waiting, all the planned affairs are on the side!
In short, a smart master Ivan arrived, fixed the breakdown, for which I thank him.
So don't be fooled by empty promises and don't waste your time.
The evening observations did not live up to expectations at all.
At first, there was a small lecture with incomprehensible material, then we looked through a telescope.
Everything was not very organized, the children climbed to look several times, the adults crowded and could not let others see.
The objects we looked through the telescope were the size of an ordinary star, and without a telescope you can see it for free.
The girl did not answer questions very clearly, not realizing that ordinary people do not know many nuances.
It is not clear what 600 rubles for.
A stunning place, one of the oldest Mexican restaurants in the city, has been around since the early 2000s.
Cozy atmosphere, always friendly service.
The price tag is average.
Sit by eating 2-3 dishes for two (portions are very large) + a cocktail, about 2500 rubles👌
There are interesting beer cocktails based on beer and tequila, for example, Macho Boracho I highly recommend trying.
The price is 420 rubles for 0.5 liters.
And in general, the restaurant itself has very tasty cuisine, I don't know about others, but I really liked it, I will advise my friends to definitely go there)
Excellent store, I have been buying goods from them for a long time, since the opening.
Good quality products.
I bought a faucet, five years have passed, and it works properly and in good condition.
Therefore, when they did a global renovation in the apartment, everything they needed was taken here.
Great dressing!!
It is located very conveniently, there is both a guard of the center and the side of the region, in general, convenient)!
The quality of gas is good, I have been refueling 2 times a week for more than 2 years, there are no problems, the price is excellent!!
Eaglets on the card and for cash, in terms of displacement, do not deceive.
The store, I liked it!
You can choose any model, at a reasonable price, and for any purpose!
The staff is always ready to help in choosing.
I took my daughter's laptop to study, because her laptop was covered.
They helped, picked up, gave a guarantee (month) Thank you! 👍
A sommelier works.
He helped with the choice of wine, because it is difficult to understand such a large menu on your own.
The experience of working with a sommelier is interesting, charming Vasily, there are not enough of them in Moscow.
I ate pike perch - magically, respect to the cook.
The children's menu is like everywhere else: pasta, fries, chicken cutlets. Mine ate pizza, it's FIRE here!
Adults appreciated the truffle, and the children with ham and mushrooms.
My husband ate smoked ribs - it's a bomb, soft, juicy, fragrant.
The staff is good, everyone is smiling, friendly.
We liked it.
The brand-new WB pick-up point is conveniently located.
Work schedule, from 10.00 to 21.00, without weekends and holidays.
There are fitting booths inside the pick-up point.
Very nice place.
Real professionals work here who are always ready to help.
There is also a WhatsApp group and chat for informative communication.
Fast issuance.
I am glad that the product can be immediately viewed and tried on.
It's great to be close to home.
Excellent, modern hotel.
The room is spacious, very clean and cozy.
Everything that is stated in the description is in stock.
Breakfast is included in the price, a large selection of dishes for every taste.
Convenient check-in, own parking near the entrance.
Solid 5.
A wonderful puppet theater.
We often go to different performances.
Today we were at the Performance "The Frog Princess".
At the moment, this is the best of children's ideas.
It was very interesting, a lot of dolls, special effects.
Even my 14-year-old son went just for company, and said that it was a very good performance.
My husband and I rested for 10 days in January 2023.
The rest was a success at "5", I liked everything!
I'll start in order:
On the day of arrival, they called, clarified at what time to wait for us, gave information about the cost of the transfer (1400 from the airport), we ordered a taxi (at 23:00 the price is 850 rubles), we arrived quickly, there were no traffic jams, they let us behind the barrier without any problems.
The administrative building is nearby, it was issued quickly, in 15-20 minutes.
All buildings have an elevator - this is a big plus!
The 2-bed room is spacious, the floors in the room and in the bathroom are warm (without heating), a huge balcony with rattan furniture (table and two armchairs), panoramic windows (in the 5th building).
The furniture in the room is normal, there is a ladies' table with a large mirror, the refrigerator is not quite small, there is even a freezer.
There are a lot of green plants in the 5th building.
Everything is clean, towels and linen are changed at your request, but if you do not ask to change, then they still change on the 4th day, the linen is of good quality.
The territory is well-groomed, benches everywhere, clean paths, beautiful lighting in the evening.
A minibus takes you to the beach and back every 30 minutes.
To the public transport stop 5 minutes.
In the dining hall there are friendly guys, they will always wish you a good day.
The food is decent, but here who goes for what, we were perfectly satisfied, and the choice and quality, there was always fish and chicken and meatballs or the like, vegetables for a side dish every day, pastries are delicious, more than 4 drinks, coffee beans, pancakes are always baked for breakfast, but cheese and sausage are not very good.
The medical staff is very friendly and loyal.
We were also lucky with the weather, there was no rain, the temperature was 11-16 ° C, the sun.
I liked everything, really rested.
I want to come again and in January, when there are few vacationers)).
It is a pity that the pool and the gym complex will not be put into operation in any way.
Thanks to the entire staff of the sanatorium for their well-coordinated and high-quality work!
We have been going to "Flight" since August.
My daughter turned 4 in September.
She likes everything very much, the coach praises) this is the most important thing.
We go to Valeria Nikolaevna Pleshkova!)
I would never have thought that my daughter was so flexible!
Wandering along the streets of St. Petersburg, my friends and I decided to look into this promising institution - and we were right!
Prices are very affordable, and incredibly delicious pizza is eaten in the blink of an eye, not even a crust remains.
Pleasant atmosphere and charming staff, in short, I recommend :)
It just so happened that I ended up in the Tomarov hospital with blood pressure and a high heartbeat.
And I was extremely surprised: cleanliness, order, wet cleaning 2 times, moreover, window sills, furniture, doors are wiped.
The food is deetic, but excellent!!
I was surprised that at 7 am they bring tea with a sandwich (bread, butter, cheese), so to speak, a pre-breakfast.
The medical staff is sensitive, everyone gives both intramuscular and intravenous injections!!
While the drip is standing, they will come in and ask how he feels...
Previously, I had a chance to do an ultrasound of the heart, but for the first time (unfortunately, I do not know the name of the doctor, a young man).
Special thanks to the attending physician Vetokhina Klavdiya Fedorovna!
A real professional: attentive, competent, gives an exhaustive answer to any question; She selected the dosage and medications, from which both blood pressure and heartbeat normalized, which she could not previously achieve after contacting other doctors.
Many thanks to the head physician Mevsha Olga Vladimirovna, who organized the well-coordinated work of the hospital!!
Thanks to the medical staff, and the nurses, and the thieves!
When visiting the customer service, the impression was good.
In the hall I met the administrator.
Competent and polite specialists promptly and patiently help customers with all questions asked.
The specialist assisted in filing an application and gave explanations on my question.
For a small store, a very good selection of goods.
There are semi-finished products, milk, vegetables, household chemicals, various trifles.
It works around the clock, which is very convenient, always friendly staff
It's cool when there is a place in the city where you can ride down the mountains.
The lifts are drag tows and on weekends, of course, the queue is going 40 seconds, the descent and 5-10 minutes the queue.
But in general, it's cool, immersion in the atmosphere of positivity and winter, even if there is dirt and dampness on the roads.
I turned to the service to repair the iPhone 11 pro.
The rear window was broken and the battery needed to be replaced.
I contacted the master Alexander directly, who explained all the subtleties of the repair and immediately outlined the price range.
Thank you for the renovation, everything was done with high quality.
The masters are very pleasant to talk to, they will show and tell you everything.
However, when replacing parts, the camera was affected, the focus was lost.
I immediately reported the problem and received a quick response.
The error was corrected as soon as possible, everything works properly.
This service has good specialists with whom it is pleasant to have a dialogue.
Prices, in comparison with other services, are reasonable.
If you need repairs again, I will definitely contact you!
Large-scale, beautiful, atmospheric.
But, like most historical objects, the condition requires close, prompt and high-quality attention of restorers.
Therefore, 4 and most of these stars are given to the creators, not the owners
Excellent yellow card
Responsive concierges, garbage is cleaned, clean and beautiful on site, close to bus stops, schools and shops.
20 minutes to the metro by public transport
We have opened a good, cozy place to relax in our area.
There are all the necessary shops.
Killer and varied food court.
Tables are located in cozy areas.
No overcrowding.
Well, we visited, tried...
The interior has nothing to do with an Italian cozy café...
There is very little space, the tables are rectangular, like in the dining room.
Pizza... Well, who has not tasted it tastier, he will like it, it seemed to me some kind of faceless.
I didn't really like the fact that the waiter is always standing behind your back and your interlocutor in front of you almost always looks in the face.
We were uncomfortable.
Connolly, yes, delicious.
We will not come here again and will not recommend to my friends.
Lena Grosskopf is the best master I have ever had my hair cut and dyed.
She does everything very carefully and efficiently, I go to her with pleasure, I understand that everything will be done perfectly.
I also take my daughter only to Lena.
The atmosphere of the cabin is amazing.
Thank you so much!
We are from Nizhny, we broke down on the way, kind people from CatResource quickly reacted and helped!
Respect to you and prosperity, I wish there were more such good people!
And the service is clean and good there!
We came to the concert of Sergey Chigrakov.
Excellent concert venue, wonderful sound and atmosphere.
We will definitely come this year to the planned concerts.
A quiet place, a wonderful Georgian restaurant, live music plays on weekends and holidays!
The staff is nice and responsive!
There is a children's room.
Amazing Georgian cuisine!
The rating is the highest, I love this place ❤
The park is in the center of the city, very easy to get to.
The park is clean, there is a place for both children and adults.
But there is no sand on the playground for a long time, only dust remains.
There is also a fenced football field, which is unfortunately not very well maintained.
But there are still more advantages in our park.
Spacious hall, clean, clear layout of goods.
There are products that can only be bought at Perekrestok.
The staff is hospitable.
I didn't get bad food.
Often promotions and discounts.
I am glad that it is close to home.
You can always find a parking space.
We were in the bar twice, I liked everything, polite staff, delicious dishes and most importantly - great music, DJs know their business.
The only thing is that the second time disappoints the lead singer of the group "Hands Up Band".
Not only does he sing to put it mildly, but he also reads the lyrics of most of the songs from his phone, I was especially struck when these were the songs of the group "Hands Up".
Somehow this is illogical (performing in the bar Ruki Vverh, in the Ruki Vverh Band group).
We rested in early March.
Nice hotel, nice rooms.
In honor of his birthday, he was given a room with a view of the Kremlin.
Room cleaning every day.
Replenishment of water, tea, coffee, shampoo and change of towels.
Breakfasts are just crazy.
There is a minibar with insane prices.
If you want to order a meal from the restaurant to your room, pay a 20% service fee.
In the restaurant, prices are slightly overpriced.
To taste for three plus.
The water park was included in the price of accommodation.
The water park itself cannot be called the best in Russia.
But the masseur was just a bomb.
Everything is fine, but the departure was a little disappointing: no goodbye, no good road.
The employee at the entrance did not even help to open the door, seeing women with a bunch of bags and suitcases.
You need to work on this in order to keep the brand.
A great place to get together with friends to take a steam bath.
A large and comfortable steam room, billiards, an open-air pool, karaoke.
The food is delicious, the drinks are fresh)
The workshop is up to the mark!
In a short time, I have already repaired 3 pairs of shoes (2 husbands and 1 wives).
Everything is fine.
The quality of work is at its best.
Special thanks to the master for his careful attitude and quality of work!
Wonderful basketball school!
My son has been going for 5 months and he really likes it, he looks forward to every workout.
Individual approach to children, interesting classes, warm and sincere atmosphere.
The store is excellent, the staff will go, I order online myself.
Excellent location of the store.
Plus, there are always discounts and promotions, which is also good
Good AB store - convenient location, large hall, good assortment.
Special thanks to the staff for their responsiveness!
There is a cafeteria with several tables.
I often visit - everything suits me!
Nice pool!
I'm specifically talking about the "frogs", Our coach Anastasia Vitalievna is very liked by the child and professional!!
The changing rooms are clean, the water is warm, there are hairdryers!
I love the bakeries, the cake, the service, the croissants, the breakfasts and the coffee are always on point.
But alas, not this time, I ordered coffee and a couple of croissants, the girls at the checkout did not make coffee until I reminded them, they did, it is impossible to drink, it stinks and there is an aftertaste of spoiled milk, I decided not to finish drinking and just left.
Last time in my coffee there was a long black hair, it was replaced.
Please be more careful, after all, I am a guest returning here, even after such incidents.
Gorgeous eyebrows are here!
Victoria perfectly corrects, taking into account all the proportions of the face individually.
Correction with warm wax, which removes all the fluff well, and the eyebrows look neat for a long time.
The color is selected according to the type of both hair and skin, so the dye lasts a long time.
You can't make eyebrows better!
Thank you very much for the organized relocation of my mother!
Moving is always a huge stress, but with your company everything went very clearly, quickly, efficiently.
Special thanks to Vadim and Roman!
I will recommend your company to all my friends!
Everything is at the highest level.
We have been treating teeth with the whole family for a long time in Novodent.
Recently, the teeth of my 8-year-old son were treated, everything went just fine, the child is calm and ready to come again.
You don't have to wait long, there are no queues because the appointment is by appointment.
For me, the most delicious shawarma in Tambov is only here, I am not a fan of shawarma, BUT when you want something harmful only here and only here.
Delicious, fresh meat, a lot of filling.
And I don't understand why, but it never flows in me.
Often, when you finish eating shawarma, you don't eat the bottom anymore, because there is a lot of sauce, water, well, in short, phew...., but not here.
Therefore, guys, you are the best🙂
Good teaching staff.
In the dining room, they always serve fresh.
Interesting lessons in the school museum, various events are held during the school year
Nice store, polite employees, good assortment.
However, a big disadvantage is that the goods that are brought are apparently destroyed right on the trading floor.
Sometimes there is little space to walk between the rows, and it is also not very pleasant when the goods are right on the floor, without pallets, but this is more of a remark to the organization, and not to a specific store
A delightful example of Soviet architecture.
Austere splendor, which is reverently cared for.
I got double pleasure from the concert, largely thanks to the atmosphere of the House of Culture.
While we were waiting for the start in the lobby, I clearly felt that I had come to the Event, that this was really an outing.
I was looking for a clutch kit for my MB Sprinter.
Quite by accident I got into this online auto parts store.
I called, indicated the vincode, they said wait)
After 10 minutes, they called back, offered several options.
Since the car personally-working did not save and asked to order a good LUK clutch kit.
After another 5 minutes, they called back and said that there was good news for you.
If you take not the whole basket + disc + squeeze, but take the LUK basket + disc set and separately the squeeze LUK, then it will be cheaper by 2 thousand rubles, which could not please.
After taking the clutch, I went to the service.
When removing the gearbox, it turned out that a flywheel was still needed and the faster, the better.
I already knew where I would go), the manager understood the situation and ordered without prepayment by call (the first time he also paid upon receipt).
The next day, the flywheel was in my hands.
The car is happy with the new flywheel and clutch, I am pleased that everything came quickly, that they went to meet halfway.
I will definitely recommend and contact vinkod.shop
The New Year's party was a success, but with nuances.
I booked a double table, it turned out that they put me in a 4-seater table.
But it doesn't matter.
It's just strange that they didn't warn me.
The kitchen is for four, the fish did not work at all.
A host with competitions made on a school-level powerpoint, to be honest, is not very good.
BUT as for the music, everything is perfect.
The atmosphere was on top.
Everything else seems to be nitpicking.
Thank you for the event
I leave my feedback, with words of gratitude to all the staff of maternity hospital number 7 in Chelyabinsk.
Only people who know and love their work, doctors and nurses from God work in this institution.
Both in the OPB department and in the maternity ward, and in the department after childbirth.
But I express special gratitude to Kotlyarova E.Y., this is the head of the maternity department on the 5th floor, and Yarantseva N.V., this is a midwife in the maternity ward, thank you very much for your help with the birth of my daughter, for your kind heart, for your great professionalism.
Lovely shop.
A large assortment of balls, always fast order formation and delivery.
Professional employees.
Very beautiful bouquets, with always left with great taste, always fresh flowers.
We visited the institution on the recommendation.
The food is amazing, there is no program, the waiters are a little cheeky, but we were in a great team with children and celebrated an important event, were friendly.
There was no fiery presentation of the plateau, the children were waiting.
You can safely go for good cuisine.
