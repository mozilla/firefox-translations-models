Republican strategy to resist Obama&#39;s re-election
Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center dismisses the latter as a myth, arguing that electoral fraud in the United States is rarer than lightning deaths.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new trends will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for organizing US federal elections.
That is why most state governments have passed laws since 2009 that make it harder to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 elections, which brought the Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, in 2011 alone, 180 bills were passed restricting the right to vote in 41 states.
New election laws require voters to show a photo ID and proof of US citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period for early voting, abolish the right to vote on the day of voting, and remove the right to vote from citizens with a criminal record.
Prior to the 2006 election, no US state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
In 2008, the US Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a law passed in Indiana.
Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills requiring voters to show photo ID in 34 states.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity card such as a health insurance card.
Indeed, 11% of American citizens, that is, 21 million people of voting age, do not have a photo ID issued by their state government agency.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a document.
However, the cost of obtaining the required ID often exceeds one hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters 18 to 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that is not all.
Student voters believed to be voting for Democratic candidates are not allowed in several states to use a photo ID issued by their school.
But these same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs, who vote mostly Republican, to vote on identification cards issued by these clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of US citizenship in order to vote.
The first such requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than ten states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are US citizens.
These measures are apparently aimed at limiting Hispanic voting.
It is believed that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican legislators initiated laws in 2011 to abolish voter registration on Election Day in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to enroll some 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 resulted in a 17% drop in new voter registration rates in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have passed laws in five other states aimed at reducing the early voting period.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of voters who voted early were African Americans, although the latter made up only 13% of the state&#39;s total voters.
The same thing happened with immigrants from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made up 24% of citizens who voted early.
Unlike whites, who, while forming 76% of voters, were only 46% of those who voted early.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters actively oppose laws that would restrict voter registration.
Several bills have been vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most controversial laws were suspended by the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This made it possible to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring photo identification.
However, the new rules that have come into effect will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Democrat critics decry the bias of the laws that have been passed, seeing them as clearly intended to influence the outcome of the 2012 election in key states.
The 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that pass these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidential election.
It is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Prostate cancer screening: test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, false negatives, and sometimes false positives, which lead to useless medical intervention.
Men, who are so reluctant to undergo medical examination, have something to doubt even more.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among study groups, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, found different mortality rates between screened and non-screened patients.
This study also showed, after a 12-year follow-up, that the likelihood of metastases is 30-40% higher in those who are not screened.
Therefore, I would recommend getting tested at age 50, or at age 40 if one of the immediate family members had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at increased risk.
The key is to make the right decision once the cancer is discovered.
Cancer can be either aggressive or indolent.
The patient needs to be explained the risk of his cancer, offering him options, not necessarily treating prostate cancer, which is not life-threatening in the long term, but making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men diagnosed with cancer will not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive or life-threatening.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease starts to progress, we will start treatment.
Increasingly, we are specifying the exact criteria for deciding who should or should not receive treatment.
Thus, I would still recommend taking the test.
But it&#39;s also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether or not you should take this test.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate the pros and cons of taking a PSA test.

prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite progress in scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people eat healthy and move enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
&quot;If no one smoked anymore, that figure would rise to at least 50%,&quot; says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancers.
And it is a risk factor for many others.
It causes enormous harm to human health.
&quot;Even today there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,&quot; spokesman André Beaulieu said.
An encouraging fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to the CAR, overweight and obesity also contribute to the onset of the disease.
They increase the risk of cancers of the breast, colon and rectum, esophagus, pancreas, and uterus.
&quot;Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer,&quot; the Association added.
Nutrition
The association also recommends limiting your consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of colon cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
&quot;The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer,&quot; the Association explains.
vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been investigating the effect of vitamin supplements on the development of cancer.
But at the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, research on vitamin E is inconsistent.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer, then the other gave the opposite result.
In assessing the impact of vitamin D on the development of cancer, there is also no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Beaulieu emphasizes that it is important to discuss your anxieties and family history with your doctor.
&quot;Passing the test does not lead to cancer.&quot;
The Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, reports that scientists might have discovered the Higgs boson caused quite a stir - and with good reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all particles in the universe, no less.
It is also the last particle predicted to exist by the Standard Model - our best, or at any rate &quot;least imperfect&quot; description of the nature and behavior of matter - but which has not previously been experimentally detected.
But physicists are not yet completely sure that we are talking about the Higgs boson.
We know beyond a shadow of a doubt that we are dealing with a truly new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although there are still not enough data to be completely sure.
Imagine, however, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of being wrong seem minimal, and let&#39;s see what this means.
There is, in this world, one absolutely inevitable law, which says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way around this rule, don&#39;t even try too hard, otherwise you will hurt yourself.
But although particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: the Pauli exclusion principle, which postulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same &quot;quantum state&quot; - this &quot;state&quot; is, in general terms, in some of their characteristics.
Based on this, physicists divide particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good citizens called fermions, who prudently obey the Pauli principle.
In the other, the Bosons scurry around, a nefarious gang of anarchists who have no respect for anything - at least for this principle, which means that they can easily be in the same place at the same time.
According to the (by the way, quite unusual) Particle Adventure website of the Berkeley Lab, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and &quot;particles of force&quot;, through which the main forces of nature are distributed and to to which the Higgs boson belongs in some way.
These very bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as one might think.
In fact, if you&#39;re able to read this chronicle, it&#39;s because of one incredibly commonplace boson: the photon, or &quot;particle of light,&quot; which is the &quot;courier&quot; of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a single particle that has an electrical charge accelerates or changes direction, it &quot;breaks&quot; the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this &quot;violation&quot; an electromagnetic wave (of light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing more than a photon - and, therefore, one of the &quot;force carrier&quot; bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be &quot;broken&quot;.
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, you need to reach very, very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That&#39;s why a huge particle accelerator is needed, like the one operated at CERN - the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! - to achieve such huge energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is also useful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with an electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stick to a refrigerator by itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while others (like the photon, by the way) do not.
So what does all this research &quot;may bring&quot;, asks Ms. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to test the validity of the Standard Model (SM), and it also allows physicists to feel for discrepancies between observations and predictions of the SM.
In addition, some of them are passionately eager for such a discrepancy to be revealed, since the slightest discrepancy can open the door for &quot;new physics&quot; and plug some of the holes in the Model.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oops!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oops!).
But so far no such discrepancies have been found at CERN.
Consequences
The benefits of these studies to the daily life of the average person are harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that they are not.
Look: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of laser research at Bell Labs could not even imagine what a revolution their work would cause.
They foresaw their applications in science, but nothing more.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous-wave laser (the previous ones were pulsed) in 1962, said that the laser was originally considered more like &quot; laboratory gadget.
Imagine...
And besides, an application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same Williard Boyle, during his optical research in 1969, developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not at all its original purpose, now serves as the &quot;eye&quot; for all digital cameras in the world and earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that anything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... | &quot;Duty&quot;
The Commission for a Dignified Death in Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is due to resume shortly, while the draft law is being drafted.
However, much remains to be done in this critical area.
Duty tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Monteregie.
Prostate cancer, which was destroying him from the inside, gave him a two-year reprieve.
&quot;I was given five years, I lived seven,&quot; he says, between life and death, lying in bed at the Victor-Gadbois palliative care home in Beleuil, where he arrived the day before.
&quot;But it&#39;s always a shock, you can&#39;t prepare for it,&quot; he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that prevents you from going to the toilet on your own and even eating on your own.
Sitting at a table with a delicious lunch on it, he gives in and agrees to be helped to eat.
He cheers up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bath.
Courage in the face of ordinary death.
&quot;My biggest desire is to be cured of my diarrhea, it&#39;s humiliating,&quot; he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
&quot;During our lives we are taught that a man should urinate standing up,&quot; says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois shelter.
To regress to the state of a child is an unbearable humiliation for some.
&quot;It all depends on a person&#39;s ability&quot; to come to terms with decline, he says.
Because, according to many people involved in palliative care, important events happen in the midst of this decline.
The patients who are admitted to the Victor-Gadbois Palliative Asylum are all sick with cancer.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses no longer provides care called &quot;treatment&quot;.
Ms. A., aged 89, is most afraid of dying &quot;conscious from suffocation&quot;.
But the disease allowed me to recognize my children.
&quot;I have good kids,&quot; she adds.
&quot;I don&#39;t want anything else in my life,&quot; she says, before allowing her to put on a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting in the coming days for the last visit of her son, who arrived from Italy.
At the Victor-Gadbois shelter, with the help of a group of volunteers, body care and nutrition assistance is provided.
This is the palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is one place in palliative care for every 11,700 residents.
This is very little, considering that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life goes on in the best conditions possible, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors at the shelter.
Be it physical, emotional or mental comfort.
For a dying person we will agree to provide brandy or Pepsi mouthwashes, whichever he asks for.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we brought beer to Mr. X, who died last night.
In the morning his son drank this beer at the feet of the deceased.
&quot;We help loved ones as well as patients,&quot; says Nathalie Savard, Director of Nursing.
At the Victor Gadbois, no day is the same.
Next to a 93-year-old man who is enjoying his last meeting with his family in the yard, perched on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a young man of 36 dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children and having tried everything to survive.
&quot;In the last six months, three to five beds are always occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,&quot; Dr. Christian Martel says with concern.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois shelter come from home and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is believed that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a shelter.
And some institutions, such as the Victor-Gadbois Orphanage and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec&#39;s healthcare system that makes many palliative care physicians wary of legislation legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by palliative care luminaries Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, declaring their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec&#39;s healthcare system is not strong enough to ensure the right to high quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room, in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary measures to alleviate them.
I fear that patients wish to die only because they do not receive adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists are trying to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Ellen Richard&#39;s hopes for survival were already minimal when she stopped debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight, she says.
At the same time, she herself told me that my days were numbered!
There is no omnipotent care
Dr. Martel estimates that 90% of patients who ask for death thank the medical staff for not complying with their request, after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not completely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Palliative Home Care Society of Greater Montreal, patients are not responsive to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either occasionally or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we are unaware of these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to access palliative sedation.
Patients suffering from pain always say the same phrase: &quot;I want to die.&quot;
But it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean &quot;I want to be euthanized&quot;, it means &quot;I want to feel better&quot;.
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Health Research Institute of Canada.
Large scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Road construction officials, building contractors, political party fundraisers and Italian mafia experts tell day by day what they know about the colossal &quot;system&quot; that entangles the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi.
An &quot;industry&quot; that cost Quebec taxpayers dearly, especially in 1990 and 2000.
&quot;It&#39;s curious how this system falls apart after all means have been put into action, jokes Jacques Ducheneau, MP and former police chief of Montreal.&quot;
It was thanks to him that a scandal erupted in 2011 as a by-product of an investigation into malfeasance related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the Liberal Prime Minister of the time, Jean Charest, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchesneau Report made a direct link between industry, clandestine political party financing, and corruption.
&quot;Since the investigation began in 2010,&quot; he stresses, the Department of Transportation alone would save a billion dollars in contracts if some curbed their instincts to take a share.
The Charbonneau Commission has &quot;already ousted two mayors,&quot; he adds, hoping that it will be able to &quot;uncover the schemes behind individuals.&quot;
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, has joined the cause, and includes a vast staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit &quot;Hammer&quot;, who after 2009 forced the &quot;sewage cartel&quot; of Montreal, to stop overstating the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, notably Franck Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of the small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next in line is Gilles Vaillantcourt, who recently resigned as mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly taking bribes when placing government orders.
In addition, several Italian-born Montreal railroad engineers and building contractors were formally charged, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter blew up a real bomb, telling the investigation about the &quot;system&quot; for obtaining government contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of contracts awarded in Montreal to a mafia-connected middleman, who in turn transferred money to Mayor Gerald Tremblay&#39;s United Montreal party.
In the 2000s, Zambito littered money left and right. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly the Liberals then in power.
In addition, he admitted that he illegally raised funds for the former Deputy Prime Minister from the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewer contracts that were overpriced
In Montreal, the &quot;system&quot; of corruption worked flawlessly.
Gilles Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts from construction firms, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes for a total of $ 736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, which he overpriced.
Other officials in charge of road construction have confessed to getting their hands dirty by overbilling by 30-40% with fake add-ons.
Then one organizer from the mayor&#39;s party, Martan Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party coffers with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay stepped down in early November, plunging Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputies in Montreal to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the Rivière de Prairie district in the east of the island, she has opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal lot bought for $5 million and resold for...1.6 million to developers at the height of a building boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation that will eventually be launched, she will &quot;pull the string to understand the operation of the ant-infested system to stop the gangrene and identify those responsible.&quot;
She characterizes this process as &quot;painful, but positive.&quot;
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and monitor to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How do we clean the house.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes for his part that &quot;officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars,&quot; but he is especially concerned about the role of &quot;elected officials who knew about this scheme&quot; but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in campaign finance in Quebec is as high as 70%, he jokes: &quot;I was told that it was just a pale reflection of reality.&quot;
The Quebec government is proposing a limit of $100 in donations to parties, but it won&#39;t change the situation, he says: &quot;Until we strictly limit election spending, there will be dirty money in politics.&quot;
He calls for a complete overhaul of government contracts and party funding: &quot;We can&#39;t go any lower; by boldly getting to the bottom of things, we can build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy.&quot;
If this story casts a shadow on the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau urges those who laugh to look into their own backyard...
&quot;PSG is not FC Barcelona!&quot;
You have achieved extraordinary proportions this season at PSG.
How do you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by the new dimension of PSG.
The great players have arrived.
I grow with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during a match, it&#39;s easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I don&#39;t get excited.
From the very beginning at the NIF pre-training center in Clairefontaine until my arrival in Saint-Étienne, I have always stepped forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
Replenishment this summer is not new to play matches of a very high level.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me is eager to be at the level and give everything to the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti provides support in my positioning.
He is assisted by deputies like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti - master of the situation?
Certainly.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technical staff.
Today in the First League he has no equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a lot of experience and has won quite a few titles with top clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I was moving away from a whole series of injuries.
The trust he has in me also explains my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the PSG season?
In the First League, Lyon took the leader&#39;s place from us.
But we are still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified in spectacular fashion to the one-eighth final.
What is the goal of the club in this tournament?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
We will be able to say our word face to face with very good European teams.
We first want to finish first in our group, in front of Porto, in order to be able to host the second leg in the one-eighth final.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget for this...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and secure its position for the long term.
Today it is not so.
Financially, PSG have the means to make this project a reality.
Not taking the title in the First League, like last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to get this championship title.
We were close to that last season.
In May, it was a disappointment because we had everything to finish first.
It was a very successful season.
We finished it with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points suggests the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, had an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that strong teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think that we have the strength to win.
Don&#39;t you think that the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It&#39;s normal that a lot is expected of us, considering how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and they still find something to criticize us for, of course, it&#39;s a little frustrating.
We wonder what is the first thing people expect from us.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a score of 4-0.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We are trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We proved in the Champions League that we can meet today&#39;s challenges.
Look at Manchester United, who have not managed to reach one-eighth of the final for two seasons, although they also spent a lot of money!
Considering the sums invested, we represented you 15 points ahead already by the winter break.
It would be a disdain for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who weren&#39;t up to the mark last season, have been woken up by this new PSG.
It shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, in the end we won.
PSG seem to be completely dependent on the exploits of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
So what if they say that there is some kind of &quot;Zlatanozavisimost&quot;.
It just means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for this and he proves that he is a League One star.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
This encourages others to improve their game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you survive Euro 2012 with France?
How disappointing.
I ardently wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from snatching some playing time.
I saw many things there, and I came out stronger from there.
Today I manage to play good qualifying matches.
This is what I have hoped for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps&#39; first months in charge of the Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
What was Laurent Blanc?
But I would not like to compare.
Blanc achieved his goal, he qualified us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1) pulled out on October 16 in Spain - is this the foundation match?
This match gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The exact opposite of the current money exchange based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties with fees to process them.
Also, as is often the case with these technologies, a political vision is evident: the belief that the current monetary system of banking monopolies is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible to dollars, euros...) and a secure BitTorrent-like exchange protocol that allows peer-to-peer file sharing.
About 200,000 transactions have already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins for donations or as a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, having peaked at $30 (€23) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later before returning to around $10 today (rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the worldwide exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB), in its virtual currency report released in October, took interest in the system.
He describes bitcoin as &quot;the most successful virtual currency&quot;, &quot;rivaling the dollar or the euro&quot; and &quot;similar to conventional currencies&quot;.
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies in that the &quot;credits&quot; used to advance in a video game are earned by playing or can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and processed by some central authority.
In Bitcoin, all nodes in the network are simultaneously ledgers, auditors, currency issuers, buyers, and sellers.
How does this network function?
Every transaction between two users is actually between two email addresses, much like email.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose a different address, thus ensuring anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is electronically signed using a dual key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to verify that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in the public ledger distributed throughout the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this ledger.
It goes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, the solver of which, like a temporary central bank, gets the privilege of adding this new line.
We are talking about the file hashing phase, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers &quot;take&quot; a new transaction and add a number to it before &quot;hashing&quot; the whole thing together.
The goal is to find a number that will give a unique digital signature (many leading zeros).
Once this number is found, it is easy for other nodes to verify that it is correct.
The transaction is thus inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, for the purpose of deception, the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) wished to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the award is regularly halved, probably until the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible to one hundred millionth, which leaves a reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with increasing computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Websites providing Bitcoin services were attacked and bitcoins were stolen from reserves.
&quot;The defect exploited is not related to the protocol itself,&quot; says Pierre Noiset, who recently launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB has also reported the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this disadvantage.
Big players like Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, like the WordPress blogging platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
&quot;Giant sales&quot; were announced in November.
&quot;Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged,&quot; cheers Jon Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noiset, another author of the tutorial on this currency, is a firm believer in the potential of this technology as an operating network.
His system, Paytunia, is the real-money equivalent of a credit card or contactless mobile phone payment, but it uses bitcoin to validate transactions, making it cheaper.
The owner has better control over his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough just to provide an address that can be &quot;photographed and recognized&quot; by the phone, Pierre Noiset clarifies, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
&quot;Before Bitcoin is established, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,&quot; he predicts.
The ECB in its report proposes, by the way, to reconsider the various risks that are considered to be elevated today, if this system is successful.
We left Afghanistan.
What&#39;s next?
French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future, not relying only on us.
We suffered mainly Afghan peasants, whom we considered as terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 soldiers killed, and wounded and crippled.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as they did under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated and sometimes helped by local rebels, but they will no longer exist as soon as the West becomes more delicate.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, proceeded in order.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles, escorted by helicopters, reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood due to the struggle between various factions.
Their taking control of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women paid the price for the obscurantism of these peasants, in which they were surpassed by al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved even today.
The former Mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, seizing state land to resell it as a building block to repatriates returning from Iran and Pakistan using huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
The people, I heard in the countryside, want a government that is not thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as those who succeeded by American generosity will leave: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of the war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, one-fifth of the total population.
The public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who will not want to return either to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas that represent the modern world and are watched everywhere.
At the moment there is an army.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders who waged the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore the provincial squads, which would not be subordinate to the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, should be decentralized to a certain extent, along the lines of Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with a strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially ahead of the April 2014 elections.
But his country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even earlier.
Industry has not been put on its feet, not a single dam is functioning, not a single irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ravaged by thirty years of war, government control of the infrastructure would be necessary.
There were rumors that Afghanistan had enormous mineral wealth.
This only reinforced the feeling that Western countries were there only to take over.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper locally, without the means of transport to export it over the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have almost abandoned the Mes Ainak copper mine, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the huge Buddhist complex and remain the province&#39;s biggest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat units was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: a lyceum for girls, for boys, the French language department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to &quot;win hearts and minds&quot; and fulfill the impossible task of combining aid with offensive operations, the Ministry of Defense&#39;s &quot;civil-military activities&quot; service (Cimic), abolished in 2012, along with a small French NGO, has contributed to numerous public works and activities aimed at restoring agriculture in dozens of mountain villages.
These works, with the intensive involvement of local labor, were able to help contain the rebellion: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and an increase in arable land.
What will we leave as a memory of ourselves by spending two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would help improve the living conditions of the local population, which are very harsh in these valleys, located often at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small agricultural work from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
To get rid of the rebellions led by foreign factions, which is what the farmers want, they told me, they need to give them a little non-military support that is well controlled and goes directly to them.
Difficult birth of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risky move by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it emergency powers, he decided to play all in.
Taking everyone by surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Exactly one week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
It will soon be two years since Egypt is relying on a draft text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal conflicts.
This new initiative only deepened the division of the country.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his &quot;autocratic delirium&quot;, continuing to &quot;break his word&quot; and &quot;trample the right.&quot;
In the camp of his followers, they are sure that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by speeding up the transition process.
The referendum must be held within fifteen days.
A very short period of time which causes the Brethren to abandon their intention to explain the text to the Egyptians, article by article.
It is also a way for the president to restore public and democratic legitimacy as discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote yes, he stated in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote is like an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: &quot;Either you vote for my text, or I keep emergency powers for myself,&quot; which is supposed to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, the 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted in favor of the text yesterday.
Most liberals did not respond to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they slammed the door, feeling unable to get their point across.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society have done the same.
In order to reach the required quorum, 11 reserve members were hurriedly added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were amused by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around ... the time for prayer, since some members of the committee felt that the hours of the Constituent Assembly were not set correctly.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The object of public attention, Article 2 ultimately remained identical to the article in the 1971 Constitution, stating that &quot;the principles of Sharia are the fundamental source of law.&quot;
Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace &quot;principles&quot; with &quot;rules&quot;, which would enable their more rigorous application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
&quot;Hypocrisy,&quot; answer the liberals, who see this as just PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to Article 220, which grants Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Sophie Pommier, an expert on Egypt, this is worrisome because &quot;the people called upon to make decisions are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.&quot;
We can see the rise of theocracy.&quot;
Many liberals are also aghast at the fact that the next chancellor of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment there is no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within civil law.
Most of the jurists who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with a university education, some trained in the French system,&quot; reassures Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “there may be some ambiguity around Article 220, since the terms used in it are borrowed from religious vocabulary.
This applies in particular to &quot;fiqh&quot; [Islamic jurisprudence - ed.].
And in the future, the question may arise how competent civilian judges are to rule on this.&quot;
Apart from its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is being criticized as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood claims they are much reduced from what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the defense budget will be considered not in Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Also, the trial of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they consider detrimental to freedom.
Blasphemy remains liable, and insult is now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles talk about women&#39;s protection anymore, emphasizes Heba Moraef of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive aspect is the prohibition of torture in Article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was scheduled to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Navel of the Earth and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and pristine nature.
&quot;AiF&quot; identified the five most important reasons why you need to visit Israel.
Let&#39;s bow to holy places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that God&#39;s grace descends on everyone who enters this &quot;font&quot;.
And Galilee is the place of Jesus&#39; miracles: turning water into wine at the wedding, walking on water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples after the resurrection.
But most of the shrines are in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass the Path of Sorrow or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It starts at the fortress of Anthony - Praetorium - where there was a trial, and through the streets of the Old City leads to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Anointing Stone and the burial place of Jesus.
There is also a symbolic Christian Navel of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem was erected on the site where, according to Christian legend, a tree grew from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem, there is also the holiest place for the Jews - the Wailing Wall, left over from the temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes here, which then come true.
Take a vertical trip
The ruins of the fortress of Massada were left from a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC. for your family.
They are located on sheer cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are fond of mountaineering can get to them on their own.
The rest is delivered to this historic peak by a cable car lift.
And in the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600-2040 m, there is the famous Hermon ski resort, where in the winter months there is a huge influx of tourists.
A shuttle bus delivers to it from the foot of the mountain.
The total length of ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an old legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can&#39;t visit them all in one trip.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth a visit.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It contains the oldest Qumran manuscripts, or the Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Judean Desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
In its exposition, the canvases of the impressionists and expressionists of Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso are widely represented.
In Akko, you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which consists of several halls of ancient Turkish baths with models of visitors and attendants of that time.
In Caesarea, it is worth visiting the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are strictly not accepted.
The fifth - the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv - tells about one of the most dramatic pages of history.
The most tragic section - the children&#39;s memorial - was built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it - and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
Stars twinkle.
And the names of Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died are heard.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
improve your health
The three main resort areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
It is interesting that people swim in the Red Sea even in the winter months, since the water temperature there does not fall below 21 degrees Celsius, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and people swim there all year round.
By the way, this most extraordinary sea in the world is located at the lowest point on the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a brine that easily keeps afloat even those who cannot swim at all.
The landscapes around are unrealistically beautiful.
People come here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - brine, and healing mud, and to treat their health with dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, in order to put in order shaky nerves.
Touch the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the old part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous Sea Route passed through it, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists are very fond of wandering through the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls on the street of &quot;your&quot; sign, Fortune will become favorable.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for photo shoots.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander around the Roman theater, &quot;take&quot; the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Note to the tourist
Going to Israel, don&#39;t worry about your imperfect English: in the country, about 30% of the population knows Russian.
It is better to take money on a trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now $ 1 - 3.8 shekels).
City transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa has the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper City.
In fact, this is an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of public transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, Shabbat is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets, shops, and public transport stop working.
Sunday morning starts the work week.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without scales and dishes that combine milk with meat.
They offer a large selection of lamb and beef dishes, soups and desserts cooked with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauces, balls of ground chickpeas - falalel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of well-fed cats that imposingly &quot;walk by themselves.&quot;
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Purrs love crowded places and do not refuse treats.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus insurance - $15 per day.
A bike rental will cost 15 shekels. in a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
In 2012, over three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of all, citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine came to travel and relax.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land, which is 51% more than in 2010, before the abolition of visas on February 9, 2011.
&quot;Great and mighty&quot; will bring to Moscow: migrants save money for the language
While deputies and human rights activists are arguing about what the law on mandatory language testing will give, scammers have already appeared in the country selling &quot;fake&quot; certificates
Every year, 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
For the most part, these are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their sole purpose is to earn money to support the families left behind.
On December 1, a law came into force, according to which every labor migrant will be required to take an exam for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule is valid only for those who intend to work in the service sector, housing and communal services, household and retail trade.
However, over time, the FMS promises, tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
Moreover, you will have to take not only the language, but also Russian history, and the foundations of legislation.
Language proficiency will have to be confirmed both for obtaining and for extending a work permit.
The exception is valid only for citizens of those countries where Russian is the state language.
People who managed to get certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991 are not subject to the law.
Benefit, doom and protection of rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, Peoples&#39; Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take tests in all cities; more than 160 such centers have already opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by both State Duma deputies and the Federal Migration Service.
But human rights activists, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press the question: what will it actually give?
What will change the mandatory knowledge of the language for both Russians and visitors themselves?
First of all, representatives of the migration service answer, this will reduce the number of people suffering from &quot;labor slavery.&quot;
Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of labor migrants, explains Viktor Sebelev, head of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only a system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise for migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, - Sebelev is sure, - the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will put him a &quot;voucher&quot; in a terrible cramped barracks, where he and dozens of his kind will languish for months without food and documents, working 12-14 hours per day.
We receive a lot of complaints from our migrants.
&quot;At home, they are promised one thing, but upon arrival they are deceived, their passports are taken away, and the promised salary is not paid,&quot; Tolib Sharipov, head of the Main Department of Labor Migration of the Tajik Ministry of Justice, confirms.
Do not swear, nasyalnik!
Nevertheless, so far many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to work in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country they are striving for, but also have difficulty writing in their own.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as a misfortune: few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even a sensible primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to even feed their children, not to mention the fact that they are decently dressed, shoes and equipped for school.
Growing up to adolescence, these guys go to work as soon as possible.
It is difficult if it is bad with knowledge of the language, they admit.
&quot;You feel humiliated and inferior.&quot;
True, human rights activists note one important point with regard to the law on language.
Testing will be carried out only for those migrants who have a legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam, no subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers are still living in Russia illegally.
&quot;Welcome or No Trespassing&quot;
Many of the visitors claim that it is not so easy to get official status in our country.
The reason is bureaucratic obstacles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only one and a half thousand.
Russian police officers know that we mostly have false documents, no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
&quot;They ask for a hundred, two for cigarettes, tea,&quot; Tajik citizen Umed Khushkadamov shared with reporters.
&quot;Fly, don&#39;t be stingy, buy a painting&quot;
On the very first day of the entry into force of the language law, it turned out that not only migrant registration documents are false.
Several &quot;fake&quot; certificates of passing language tests have already been confiscated by the FMS.
Fake papers are printed on a conventional color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get them for nothing: each of the migrants, who hoped in this way to make it easier for themselves to pass the tests, paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice as expensive as the official testing procedure: it will cost a labor migrant three thousand.
Both authorities and human rights activists agree that the main task for the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that &quot;crusts&quot; cannot simply be bought.
In the meantime, the authorities can promise guest workers who failed to successfully pass the test the first time, time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into circulation the illegal arms market
The share of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law against owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government&#39;s response to recent incidents: Shots fired at weddings when there were no casualties, and the massacre by Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov that killed seven people.
The police want to ban the wearing of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the age at which you can get a gun license from 18 to 21.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, and promised that amendments to the law on weapons would be submitted to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy that the Russian authorities are trying to deal with the problem by &quot;tightening the screws.&quot;
An open letter appeared on the net, the authors of which - representatives of various public shooting organizations - demand that the &quot;senseless tightening&quot; be abandoned.
The percentage of hooliganism with a registered weapon is minimal, said forensic lawyer Vasily Lesnikov to the BBC Russian Service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, during the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered with the internal affairs bodies, while in total 1,168,000 crimes were recorded over the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the tightening of legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not prevent the criminal from going to the &quot;black&quot; market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Internal Affairs claims that they control the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The &quot;black&quot; arms market is replenished through several channels.
There are five main such channels, says retired colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is the &quot;army or military trace&quot;, that is, weapons that were stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
&quot;Weapons were dragged by both Russian officers and Caucasians themselves,&quot; says Baranets.
The next type of &quot;black weapon&quot; is the one stolen by criminals from law enforcement agencies.
Baranets explains that this includes both those carried away from police warehouses and those stolen directly from law enforcement officers.
Illegal &quot;trunks&quot; go on sale from military warehouses.
Explosions occurred frequently in many military depots.
&quot;There are proven versions that some of the arsons were done on purpose - to cover up the shortage,&quot; says the former military man.
Arms manufacturers are making their contribution, according to Baranets.
&quot;Now private arms factories are multiplying, which cannot withstand competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the floor to the black market, including Moscow,&quot; the expert says.
Another source of the &quot;black&quot; market is smuggling.
Especially a lot of pistols and machine guns come from poor countries, for example, Kyrgyzstan.
“They have their own production, sometimes handicraft, and a mafia has formed that organized the flow,” the former military man explains.
Where is the weapon from?
The experts calculated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the &quot;black&quot; market.
A report on this was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and State Management Design.
Experts analyzed the reports of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data from portals on weapons topics.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, comes from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market ended up there &quot;through the fault of officials whose work is related to weapons,&quot; the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases theft occurs at the stage of weapons production, 5% falls on &quot;black archeology&quot;.
The sales assistant of one of the weapons stores, who asked not to give his last name, assures that no one has been buying weapons found by black diggers for a long time - they are too old.
Most often, as he says, sellers go to a military warehouse for a new batch.
Through an ensign, a person buys a unit, such as a TT pistol.
They write it out to him, pass it through the fence.
&quot;He transports it to the city and sells it here for 900 euros apiece with two stores,&quot; he says.
&quot;True, the police are aware of all the cases, so from time to time, when the crime detection plan is on fire, they conduct a test purchase from illegal arms dealers,&quot; the consultant adds.
&quot;Like a luxury store&quot;
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at sites, blogs, until a friend responded, who offered to come to the Begovaya platform, where there would be a person who would take me to the &quot;corner&quot; where we would bargain.
I found out the price of the trunk only there
military observer Viktor Baranets
To get the barrel, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales assistant. - I have such a friend, but I&#39;m not sure about him.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, &quot;from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked me to tell you that my daughter&#39;s tooth fell out.&quot;
Now I even get a couple of brass knuckles through a person in whom I am sure.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I will not give him up.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranets dabbled in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing an article about it for publication.
The plans, he said, have not changed.
He was given an album of photographs containing &quot;anything&quot;.
&quot;I felt like I was in a luxury store,&quot; the military man recalls.
The buyer, according to Barants, is not offered a pig in a poke - everything can be tried.
I, a potential client, do not just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, we set a target there.
&quot;They give me the opportunity to shoot, and when I am convinced that the weapon hits well, we begin to bargain,&quot; the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the couch
Search engines on the Internet lead to sites and groups in Vkontakte, where they offer to buy weapons &quot;for various purposes.&quot;
This does not require any documents and personal meetings.
&quot;It is enough to have a certain amount of money,&quot; they write in the advertising heading on the website &quot;Buy a Combat Pistol or Machine Gun.&quot;
On it, users leave their applications and ask questions.
Will they sell to minors?
&quot;Without a license, of course,&quot; - asks the user &quot;Ivan&quot; (spelling preserved).
&quot;I&#39;ll buy TT.Moscow&quot; - Fedorenkov succinctly formulates the request.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and those who want to buy military weapons are rowing with a shovel.
People go like hungry fish for bait, and then they mine coal in Siberia
military observer and former military Viktor Baranets
I heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People are taking orders.
The buyer pays through an ATM.
&quot;In response, they send a photo and instructions where the weapon is hidden,&quot; says Dmitry Kislov, spokesman for the Right to Arms NGO.
Viktor Baranets claims that by leaving a request on the site, you can be left without a weapon and go to jail.
The Federal Security Service has now scattered a huge network of fake sites and those who want to buy military weapons are rowing with a shovel.
&quot;People go like hungry fish for bait, and then they mine coal in Siberia,&quot; he says.
Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can meet the amount of 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the Right to Arms organization, a Makarov pistol can be purchased for $100-$300.
You will have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these middle-level warehouses.
According to official statistics of the department, compared with January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of detected facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7 ,8%.
Fast food and supermarket workers strike in the US
Up to a quarter of all American teenagers work at the McDonald&#39;s checkout
In recent days, a wave of protests has swept across America against low wages at Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast food chains such as McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy&#39;s and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
So far, no one undertakes to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or whether it is destined to fizzle out in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages that rank-and-file workers at Walmart and the fast food chain receive, the goal of the organizers of the protests is to create union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
Actions began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called &quot;Black Friday&quot;, when an orgy of giveaways hit America, capturing millions of inhabitants and sometimes accompanied by brawls.
On this day, some employees of the Walmart corporation, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed, along with trade unions and leftist activists, corporation stores whose goods are designed for people of modest and average incomes.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in his stores are on average 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
Therefore, many low-paid Walmart workers only shop at their jobs.
Availability and range of goods made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
Critics say Walmart can afford to sell cheap in part because it doesn&#39;t pay its workers well.
The latter also complain about harsh working conditions, such as a shortage of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Black Friday protesters demanded higher wages and complained that the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical $9.5 an hour Walmart worker couldn&#39;t afford the expense, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
This is about 1.1% more than she spends on her salary now.
If Walmart shifts the entire wage increase onto the shoulders of customers, then each visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend some $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in just nine states and did not cause the corporation the slightest damage.
&quot;Black Friday&quot; continued at its stores from 8 p.m. Thursday until midnight the next day, during which time Walmart was selling about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Corporate spokesman Dan Fogelman claimed in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of &quot;less than five&quot; Walmart employees left their jobs, and that the protest was just &quot;another PR stunt&quot; by the union that organized it.
&quot;Free checkout!&quot;
The protests continued this week in New York, where they were targeted not at Walmart department stores (they are not favored in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), but at McDonald&#39;s and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald&#39;s says it sells billions of servings and after that it doesn&#39;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!
Jumaine Williams, New York City Councilman
Currently, the federal and New York minimum wages are $7.25 an hour.
Fast food restaurants increase it over time, but not by much, and on average their front-line workers in New York City make $8.90 an hour.
No one earns less than them in this expensive city.
How it is possible to exist in New York on such money is incomprehensible to me.
Once upon a time, almost a quarter of American teenagers passed through McDonald&#39;s, who worked part-time at their counters after school, while living with their parents.
Few people saw this as their main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly come across interviews with McDonald&#39;s employees who complain that they have to live on this salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, there is a comment on the Wall Street Journal forum, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what you will feed them on.
The protesters, which began at 6:30 a.m. Thursday at McDonald&#39;s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food chefs be paid at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their pay. current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade unions be formed in the fast food industry.
American law prohibits the administration from hindering this and punishing union activists with chicanery and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easy for them.
But it is also difficult to cover fast food by the union for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the extraordinary staff turnover.
Dissenters
Noisy protests took place that day at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The rally culminated in a mid-afternoon rally outside a McDonald&#39;s near Times Square, at which several local Democratic politicians spoke, including city council member Jumayn Williams, who said: &quot;McDonald&#39;s says it sells billions of servings, and after that he doesn&#39;t even give you sick days or pay you for honest work!&quot;
The demonstrators were supported by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that &quot;we must stand united in support of fast food workers so that they achieve fair pay and the economic prosperity that every New York deserves.&quot; Yorkie!&quot;
As the New York Times described the event, it was the largest action of its kind in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people participated in it, and not all of them were employees of the fast food service, which employs tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will spark a mass movement.
&quot;While deceiving the brain is average&quot;
The topic of augmented reality, popular among fans of modern technologies, has recently been taken mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, in the summer at its annual conference, Google showed the working model, and then in November it became known that Microsoft had filed an application for the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the group of interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft&#39;s Cambridge laboratory, Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company, glasses are a passed stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell us in general terms what your research group is doing?
- We are engaged in the interaction of man with machines, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity en masse is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on a flat screen, sometimes poking at them with a finger.
We want to look 5-10 years ahead and predict cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else awaits us ahead?
- Despite the fact that Kinect brought interaction to the physical level, a lot still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), but the output is not very good yet.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projective ones.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world, to make it more tangible.
To do this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we will be able to supplement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A popular item, but isn&#39;t it overrated?
- It definitely cannot be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because you do not always want to notify others about your actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, to control devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not over sweeping ones, but over such mean, short ones.
At the same time, gestures were filmed not by the camera of the device, but by a wrist bracelet, which recorded the movements of bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future belongs to a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How is that?
- For example, how do you ask me to give you this can of soda?
You say and show at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it will be very difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot currently do?
- Not necessarily, but this is a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your complaints about modern cameras?
Not enough resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what we can build on in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be nice to get 8 megapixels at 1000 fps.
But it&#39;s not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to algorithm designers.
That is, we must remember not only about the resolution along the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 fps is frankly not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Betysches from our Redmond lab made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, and modern serial sensors are closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machines.
In my work, the equivalent of such a device would be very useful to me, only it does not require touches, so that there are more frames per second.
- Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three &quot;cameras&quot;, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the other is an echo receiver.
And now the third camera is, in fact, a conventional sensor in the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of an object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or aggravate it by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible version of the Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how it helps in 3D positioning.
- As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don&#39;t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, it’s not very convenient to walk around holding a smartphone in raised hands all the time, but here’s what I think: the coolest option would be a “transitional” augmented reality, when based on a cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection display and so on everywhere.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their strength (only you see private things), and at the same time their weakness - glasses-based augmented reality will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point out: no tactile feedback!
Hands feel nothing!
What responses is your group preparing for this challenge?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
In the meantime, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
It registers clicks perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at making these &quot;pictures in the air&quot; tangible - for example, the interference of several directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is located gives a feeling, but so far it is very weak - as if you were blown on the pads.
There are also bracelets on the wrists that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to trick the brain?
Make him think that he feels what he supposed to feel at the moment when he sees something?
- That&#39;s a good idea, we haven&#39;t tried it yet.
Here lies another task that will have to be fought for a long time - how to make a person who is physically in a very limited space believe that he is walking on an open, almost endless one - we are also working on the concepts of treadmills (not at all the same as in clubs) , moving platforms, and huge balls.
While deceiving the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very much for many years.
That&#39;s what makes working on virtual reality so attractive to the researcher - many things are in their infancy.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
&quot;Rosbalt&quot; continues the project &quot;Petersburg avant-garde&quot;, dedicated to the citizens who are ahead, in the forefront of culture and art.
This top list has already included bright figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the outrageous artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, who meets either at the Russian Museum, at the Summer Garden, or at fashionable parties and vernissages.
Kirill Miller&#39;s paintings always gather crowds of spectators, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg social and philosophical storytellers, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright person of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is a man of the city, with his appearance on the streets causing a smile among the townspeople, raising everyone&#39;s spirits.
Recently, he picked up a hurdy-gurdy and became a St. Petersburg organ-grinder, as he was ripe for this complex role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Cyril, why do you still walk around the city in all red, and not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color as a fashion designer dealing with the look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image maker and society.
Although in society, everything that is a little bit gray causes aggression and excitement of an unkind nature.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to discussion.
- And when did you realize that you should be an artist?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that this is my path.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free ones like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazonevism that led to Pushkinskaya-10, and there was no more wave.
I am thrown into the theater, clothes, music, into all genres, except for the word.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important for me to find myself in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces should gather.
In 1995, I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was a repair, there was a music and arts club, a bohemian club, a home of St. Petersburg bohemia.
Many were born there: NOMS, Tequila Jazz, I remember how Shnur was brought in with the Van Gogh Ear project.
Cord and his friends sang light songs to the plywood, they were in tight tights, among them was the now fashionable composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group played live, it became &quot;Leningrad&quot;.
Trachtenberg was the host of many programs until the Khali-Gali times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went on, and he received basic education and upbringing from us.
Gallery &quot;D 137&quot;, the club &quot;Griboyedov&quot; are echoes of the Art Clinic.
There our workers and regulars have gone.
I am the hero of yesterday&#39;s century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the survey was in the press, the award was &quot;People of our city.&quot;
In the nomination &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; I was named, my culmination ended.
In new times, it is uncomfortable to work according to the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our age it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are separated, you can be popular, but not very cultured.
- Your work has a recognizable manner.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I will have a program exhibition, &quot;The Russian Museum in Clowns&quot;.
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be social, now being like that is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared, the tragedy is removed.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world by totalitarian disguise in order.
Now they are met by clothes, focusing on external mechanics, and not on the inner person.
Or maybe you can’t give him a hand and you need to spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed by changing clothes.
- And recently we saw you in the role of the city organ grinder. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me, they should be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art should be accurate, tactful, sweet.
Cultures are disintegrating.
Previously, people huddled in flocks, bohemians loved one thing, simpletons another.
Now everyone has broken up into micro-communities, now it’s hard to please everyone.
I&#39;m not a hundred dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you need to think about who will like you.
Now each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And several thousand come to Stas Mikhailov!
- Broshenki come to him, the sex-social sphere works there.
And on a cultural basis, 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and as a result, there is less management, money, everything withers away.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil what they have acquired.
In my youth I painted such pictures that one collector had them hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with the pictures that usually end.
Now the concepts are often confused.
They say: the culture is spiritual, the culture of consumption.
There is no culture in consumption, this is from another opera.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, refused money for the sake of painting.
I am for this kind of culture.
- Kirill, what is missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing: a cultural official.
But not every one of them can engage in culture.
Under the right kings, everything was not like that, the kings, perhaps, did not really understand culture, but they understood that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are pushed aside, because we need higher experts who will correctly assess these experts and give them way.
Now taste is flourishing.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that we do not accept all contemporary art, there are artists who should look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil there.
And it is difficult for art to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural soil, and now we have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
There are a lot of curious people in Europe. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
Our layer is thin.
We need to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented with a grant from St. Petersburg
give birth in space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or a killer asteroid impact.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board are sent in search of a spare planet.
In order to save humanity, the main question arises, how to continue one&#39;s race in weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, there are only two real planets that can be explored at least hypothetically.
&quot;These are Venus and Mars,&quot; says a senior researcher at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg (GAISh) Vladimir Surdin.
But if on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - temperatures of 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitude or orbiting Venus... in space.
We began to approach the issues of reproduction in space with flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were carried out on plants.
Four generations of orbit-grown peas were no different from their Earth varieties.
Then - the breeding of insects in orbit, tiny fruit flies, fruit flies.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to test how an embryo develops in zero gravity.
We get an absolutely normal chick as a result.
And here is where the problem begins.
“The problem is that this chick must find support, it must stand on its own legs and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory at the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IMBP) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Finding no support, the chicks tumbled randomly.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
And there the trouble was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we hatched chicks, after that they refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there,” Vladimir Sychev states the failure of the experiment with chicks in space.
With animals, the last time a biological &quot;mini-box&quot; flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, only single-sex individuals will be on the Bion biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with a fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
“It just happened on biosatellites, but again, this is a single experiment, and such studies should be carried out,” notes Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, space rats had offspring.
But it is not yet possible to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space.
Not an easy task.
Animals, losing their habitual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, unlike animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create an appropriate emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female body.
Our Seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could say whether it would survive after the flight into space.
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight.
&quot;After all, no one answered this question,&quot; says Vakhtang Vachnadze, a veteran of the rocket and space industry.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaev, was also an astronaut.
In 1988, the second female cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in outer space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are only a few cosmonauts who, after long flights, everything worked out, and a healthy generation is growing.
&quot;And if it&#39;s more, it&#39;s dangerous even during orbital flights,&quot; sums up pilot-cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new ways in biotechnology, protection from radiation, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the CPC is an obligatory stage of preparation for the flight.
Here, in conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts practice their skills in working in outer space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for adults water, albeit comfortable, but still an alien environment, then for infants it is a native element.
Little ichthyanders seem to confirm that life came to land from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months old with his mother in the amniotic fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of that first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
&quot;It&#39;s very little to forget something,&quot; says infant swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for a born child weightlessness is a more natural state, then for a woman gravity is necessary, gravity.
Very quickly in weightlessness the muscles of the abdomen and pelvis become decrepit, the ability to push the fetus decreases.
Well, let&#39;s omit this, relying on labor stimulants.
You can, of course, go to the birth in a special chamber, she will push him out.
&quot;And then what?&quot; - asks non-trivial questions Valery Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the earth&#39;s gravity, the body will not form the skeleton and muscular system.
A newborn in orbit cannot, like an adult, be dressed in a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what will be vital to him.
“And this experiment, which we will go through, allowing the birth of a child in an alien environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled person, a completely maladaptive person,” predicts Igor Pestov, head of the bioethics committee of the IBMP RAS.
So far, the birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, after a while it will become a reality when earthlings on their ships will go to a distant planet, which will become a home for their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main Control and Auditing Department: The check of the Schwartz system failed due to the fault of the politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good oversight bodies and, despite having good legislation, lags behind in its implementation.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kala, Vice President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktuálně.cz.
&quot;The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack,&quot; Kala commented on the current situation.
Similar conclusions are provided by the joint inspection of the Czech and German control authorities.
As an example of incorrect practice, Petr Nechas&#39;s approach to the so-called Schwartz system is cited.
Recently, the prime minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks - is it forbidden or allowed?
&quot;The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot resist the work of institutions that are charged with the duty to check and enforce obligations,&quot; Kala states.
At a meeting of the Audit Committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint project between the Czech and German sides, in which the public procurement legislation of both countries was compared.
What exactly was it about?
This refers to a parallel test, which we probably started two years ago.
Simply put, the point is that European legislation states how public procurement should take place, followed by national legislation and then also application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with the still unfinished check, interesting differences were found - in other words, our legislation can be &quot;accurate and error-free&quot;, but in practice we are inferior to Germany in some respects.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
And actually how this project can help you, what does it mean for you?
It is this kind of joint control that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, the reduction and improvement of restrictions, because this does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing for a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But it is not certain that we will achieve this by lowering the order limit.
It is possible that this system will be filled with &quot;papers&quot; so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the limit had not been lowered.
You are talking about internal problems in the practical application of public procurement legislation.
And how does the control system in Germany work?
Is there such an organization as our KRU (Control and Auditing Department) or does it work differently?
As far as the institutions are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof acts as our KRU, arranged according to our principle, there is also a collegium that works a little differently, but basically both institutions function in the same way.
In addition, the powers are similar to a certain extent, but since Germany has a federal structure, there are audit units at the level of the federal states - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have state funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of federal accounting chambers.
As for local legislation, is it easier there than here?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot be definitely said that it is better in everything.
Is it because they are better at controlling?
Definitely not, but again, I don&#39;t like these comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn&#39;t get any benefit from working with our office, right?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Law affect your institution, are the consequences somehow manifested?
Considering that the legal force of these amendments is rather short, it has not yet manifested itself in any way in our control works.
Since we are post-checking, some delay must be taken into account.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future reviews - we have started using our new tool &quot;risk detection&quot; through which we have run nearly 14,000 government contracts. We have analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because restrictions change, the conditions of some types of tenders change, and so on.
Do you think the approval of this law will bring benefits or additional burden on the bureaucracy system?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will &quot;tighten&quot; and it will not be possible to comply with them.
Under the functioning of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are linked to the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - to the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Is it worth it in this case to tighten the law in this way?
I think not in this way.
The system should exclude those who want to capture and abuse, but not punish those who make a technical error that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create more pressure on the bureaucracy.
And then how to get out of this situation?
Let&#39;s realize that this path will lead nowhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the SDS will not bother entrepreneurs with checks on the so-called Schwartz system. What does it mean?
&quot;Schwartz-system&quot; prohibited or permitted?
The law must be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the prime minister cannot resist the work of the bodies that are charged with the duty to check and enforce obligations.
You can say, &quot;We&#39;ll change this law and fix it,&quot; but you can&#39;t say that we&#39;re going to pretend like nothing&#39;s happening.
The Public Procurement Law contains rather strict rules on how and what should be formally carried out, and rightly so. This will protect government purchases.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal shortcomings.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery in places, but mostly passable.
In some parts of the Czech Republic the roads are frozen and covered with snow.
Mostly they are passable, but in some places with more caution.
Karlovy Vary region
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region the roads were passable, but in some places they were frozen and covered with snow.
The temperature has dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but should warm up a little during the day.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, only a small layer lies in the lowlands.
However, there is about 30 centimeters of snow on the ridges of the Ore Mountains.
From information received from regional road workers, it became known that in some places there was lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first class roads in the region are currently passable without restrictions.
However, care is needed, for example, on bridges, where the surface can be frozen and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third class, including mountain roads, are passable.
But in some of their areas, the remains of frozen and sometimes hackneyed snow still lie.
You need to be especially careful on roads located on hills.
Pardubice and Hradec Kralove Region
The Czech Roads and Motorways Authority informs on its web pages that some roads in eastern Bohemia are at risk of ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on hills, there may be a worn-out layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about black ice, which can form especially on the uplands of the Pardubice Region.
Ice can be near Lanškroun, Usti nad Orlici, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mito, especially on second and third class roads.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located near Svitavy, have been treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of the Krkonoše and Orlické mountains.
A worn-out layer of snow is found on roads located on hills in the areas of Richnova nad Knieznow and Trutnova.
In East Bohemia today partly cloudy without precipitation.
The temperature usually varies from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light breeze.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Plzeň region are passable this morning, but in some places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
It is frosty in the morning, the temperature fluctuates from three to nine degrees below zero.
After a snowfall and subsequent cooling, it can be slippery in some places.
Drivers may encounter fog in places, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now passable with virtually no restrictions, however, road officials advise caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first class roads are dry and frozen.
Frozen areas can be found in southern Pilsen and Tachov.
Roads of the second and third class are wet, and also in this case there is a warning due to the possibility of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the little used roads in the Šumava region.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region must take into account the snow porridge on the road today.
She remained after the use of chemicals in the Chervenogorsk saddle and on the road in the direction of Videlski Krshizh.
During the night, a snowfall forced road workers to go outside, according to information from the road administration, about three centimeters of snow fell in Šumperk.
In other areas, the edges of the road are generally passable without restrictions.
&quot;On the heights of Šumperk lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards the Jeseník must be aware of the presence of snow porridge in the Chervenogorsk saddle,&quot; a dispatcher from the Šumperk Road Administration told CHAN (Czech News Agency) today.
At night, their colleagues from Jesenik also went to clear the roads, they assured that the roads on the hills after treatment with chemicals were left bare and wet.
In Olomouc, roads are passable without restrictions, but in Sternberk, drivers must be careful in forested areas where there is still moisture.
Ustec region, Liberec region
This morning, road workers from north Bohemia report that there are a few hard-to-reach places left.
According to information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, a mountain road was closed in the section from Telnice to Klinitsa in the Ustetskyi region.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Middle Mountains, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
There are no reports of any road hazards yet.
Road workers report the appearance of ice in the vicinity of Steti.
According to meteorologists, ideal conditions were created for its formation at night - it rained all day and snow melted, at night the sky cleared up and frosts began.
Unfavorable conditions are reported on the main highways and on the I / 13 highway on the border of the Ustece and Liberec regions.
Due to the branches of trees bent under a layer of snow, touching the road itself, they were forced to close the road in Telnice on Kninice.
Shimon Ornest: At concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world coming in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing pieces of news we humans fall for so easily.
Together with the band The Tap Tap, we constantly joke about this and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to play absolutely unique three concerts against the end of the world.
Could you tell readers more about this?
This is a nationwide fundraising event that we have been planning for the past two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is announced to end on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava start in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we came up with everything together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state of this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys against the end of the world. These things can be bought on the website www.e-tap.cz and thus support us at the same time.
The Tap Tap, along with other musicians, also performed an anthem against the end of the world, called &quot;The End of the World Canceled&quot;.
Will the anthem already loved by YouTube listeners be played at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything works out and the end of the world does not come.
It will be sung by all performers at all concerts at the same time.
The hymns will also be played simultaneously live on Czech television.
The words to this song were written and played the role of Jesus in the video by Tomas Ganak, also Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life as we organize many charity events and concerts.
We try to actively involve them in these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year now we have been working in this way with the civil association Tap at the Jedlicky Institute.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedlicky Institute schools and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to provide them with this opportunity in this way.
As part of the project for the additional construction of the Jedlicky Institute, a separate building will appear in the future, to which we will move with this project.
Each concert will feature several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We tried to create a program that would interest all generations, including children.
For example, Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Barta, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Jiri Suchy will perform in Prague.
All details can be found on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any similar &quot;grand events&quot; in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to perform at the Czech National House in New York, and personally, if we are in the USA, I would very much like to perform in Washington and Chicago.
As for abroad, you have serious plans, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics??
It&#39;s not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants in electric wheelchairs, their wheelchairs must travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and tool boxes.
However, so far they&#39;ve handled it with no problems. Czech Airlines ČSA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me so many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went without problems.
Thanks to travel abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public attitudes towards people with disabilities, and so on.
What have you experienced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries where everything functions better than ours, in Russia we have seen that in the east it is still at a basic level.
Compared to Prague, there are a lot of barriers in Moscow, and it is still a novelty for a person to move independently in an electric wheelchair in the city center.
Also, such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in an elevator are not in use there.
Fortunately, there are already emerging public organizations that are trying to draw people&#39;s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what, on the contrary, do we constantly have to catch up with the advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance of which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the efforts of those people who are concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite normal that people with a severe form of disability move independently on the streets, can go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere ...
It is not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we with The Tap Tap are a little ahead of them!
Respect for the public or accessibility is one thing, but the moment when famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers appear among us, then everything really starts to change.
While these are isolated cases - people with a strong will.
The Tap Tap is a very popular group at the moment, but going back two years, what made you start it in 1998?
I entered the Jedlicky Institute as an educator, there were many young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I myself am a musician and also play the saxophone, together with a colleague I organized an interesting music circle.
Well, over time, as our presenter Ladya Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
Popularity has come only in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It&#39;s true, it helped us that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the promotion of the group.
We came to the conclusion that the work that no one can evaluate, in fact, as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the very beginning, I felt their potential in being able to do something extraordinary.
Show business is full of things that imitate one another.
This is logical, everything new is accepted with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare items, but I dare say Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, is pity, this is natural ...
But this pity is completely unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all neglected individuals that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only on the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities succeed, this is a shift not only for them, but for the whole society.
Has it been successful that you are the strict leader that many people think you are?
If we want to do quality work, we must be uncompromising in many things and maintain a certain discipline.
But I think it&#39;s okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic performance and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that they have to go to rehearsals twice a week, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, they lose enthusiasm very quickly.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently twenty members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning in 1998?
Only one Ladya Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, you can&#39;t prevent it.
For those who have the desire and willpower, our doors are always open.
It will take place the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will take place in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - at the Fléda club and Ostrava - at the Plynojem center with the participation of 12 bands and other Czech musicians.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a teleconference during the performance of The Tap Tap&#39;s song &quot;The End of the World Canceled&quot;.
The purpose of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million crowns for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Jedlicky Institute in Prague.
A ticket to the concert costs 400 kroons, for children under 12 years old the entrance is free. Tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, at the European Space Agency ministerial meeting, Poland was admitted as the 20th member of the European Space Agency, as the second country from the countries of the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of the ESA on September 12, 2008).
Poland began close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years took an active part in a number of ESA projects.
But Poland began its path to space much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in flights into space, but this was not always met with understanding.
Let me remind you, for example, of the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who on December 6, 1933, presented ideas from his pioneering work &quot;Introduction to Cosmonautics&quot; at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience indifferent, after several years Sternfeld recalled that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esnault-Peltri and André Louis Hirsch Prize for &quot;Introduction to Astronautics&quot;.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned above, later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known world promoter of astronautics, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the Moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway trolley equipped with a rocket engine was built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether a rocket should have been used to accelerate or decelerate the trolley.
Information about this trolley is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about rocket arrows.
The study was carried out by the Armament Technology Section in cooperation with professors Mieczysław Wolfke and Gustav Mokrzycki.
From the surviving materials it can be seen that the research has reached the stage of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German troops, work was interrupted.
In 1937, the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket, which was proposed by engineer Rogozinsky, appeared in the specialized press, and the following year, the work &quot;Air torpedo rocket and aircraft bomb rocket&quot; by the author Leliva-Kzhivoblotsky was published.
Both projects were developed for the military use of rocket engines.
Before the war itself, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were handled by the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity, the work ended due to the outbreak of war.
The next scientific work devoted to astronautics appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The society was first mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the journal &quot;Problems&quot;, which published four voluminous articles on astronautics.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would deal with astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space research was a promising industry.
From the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronautical Society (POA) tried to join the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951), and already in the fall, the POA became its full member.
And the following year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), the first chairman of the POA, became deputy chairman of the International Astronautical Federation.
He remained in this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, PHA has made a significant contribution to the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was the first Polish rocket to carry out a scientific study.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, capable of covering a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, a two-stage RM-2 rocket was tested on the Bledovsky wasteland.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket could cover 14.5 km, and its task was to observe the high-altitude wind.
But in 1962, further development was suspended.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965, became the successor to the first RM-type missiles.
The rocket was conceived as a two-stage rocket, with an overall length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types were developed (designated as Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the chamber for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a space of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1V - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was being developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was capable of launching a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland&#39;s accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In addition, within the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Germashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
Repeal of the public works law is not the solution to the problem.
Last week, the constitutional court annulled the public works law.
The resolution caused a lively discussion in society.
Undoubtedly, it will be interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberal-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wages), price tension arises.
This concept should be understood as a state when a manufacturer, by delivering a cheap product, tries to survive in economic competition by &quot;knocking down&quot; the cost of a competitor in order to take a large part of the market for himself and, thus, increase his own income.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment rises in those countries where the cost of labor is, in comparison with others, high.
Since private capital does not bear any social responsibility, including for the unemployment it has produced, the inevitable costs of the state for social needs grow.
On the whole, the situation strengthens the unwillingness of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the public economic and social damage caused by them in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The unceremonious methods of private capital create situations at the level of the economies of individual states when the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments leave their own populations to the mercy of private capital, despite social decline.
This is reflected primarily in changes in the current legislation.
The goal is to economically force their people to submit to the dictates of private capital, primarily in the field of wages.
This acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to curtail workers&#39; rights in the field of labor law.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and with it the gap between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years now, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are not able to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
As part of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, cases constantly occur when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them extra so that they receive a living wage.
A similar scandal became known to the public in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU are undoubtedly leading to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic decline in social status are forced to either emigrate, as was the case in the 19th century, or exist on a beggarly wage in the margins of society. in the hope that someday private investment capital will come to the country.
But the question is, where does it come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, since the Chinese, Indian, Brazilian, Turk, Moroccan, Egyptian, African are still working for a share of European wages.
This applies to all of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the media assert ad nauseam that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a controlled economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital stubbornly insists that the state should not interfere in the economy with managerial actions.
Next, the question should be answered whether private capital, which now practically controls politics and that very same state, does not act for its own selfish purposes?
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The proof is the existence of almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, provision of mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that the state ministries, due to lack of financial resources, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms that are closely connected with industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power comes not from the people, as the Western-style constitution says, but from financially powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously, liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in a situation, as described by Appian in &quot;The Crisis of the Roman Empire in the Days of Caesar and Pompey&quot;:
Bribes, illegal receiving favors with the help of stones and swords.
Bribery and corruption flourished without any prohibitions, and people went to the polls with a pre-sold vote&quot;&quot;...decent people did not run for the position of ruler at all, in the end one day the state was left without a consul for eight months&quot;... .. &quot;They started in earnest to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is autocracy and the need to choose an energetic person &quot;.. Appian thought it would be Pompey, but it was Caesar, who finally changed democracy to autocracy.
As in ancient times, modern society is dominated by its own reckless interests without regard to public interests.
Private capital is no longer inherently intended to be used for public purposes.
The present result is no different from the past: an unparalleled decline of the elite without any effort to bring about reforms of a deeper nature.
This means that we must look for the cause of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already seeing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know it from old and new history.
Repeal of the public works law is not a solution, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition both at the international and national and European levels, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
Thus, this trend is systemic.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the share of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
&quot;Nothing will come of violence, and never can come out&quot; - Sting, the song &quot;Fragile&quot;, where the main verse of the refrain is the words: &quot;do not forget how fragile we are.&quot;
&quot;If my sons didn&#39;t want wars, they wouldn&#39;t exist&quot; - dying Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip has, as always, evoked many responses.
Some are in favor of Israel, arguing its position by the fact that it has the right to self-defense, and the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing that the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the state of Israel is attributed the role of a terrorist state.
I do not want to speculate about who is the perpetrator and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killings, after all, today&#39;s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and did not witness the beginning of violence.
My purpose is to invite readers to look behind the curtain, to see who is primarily served by the 95 year tension (since the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of land in the Middle East.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of them are derived from my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is, first of all, the history of the struggle for power.
In every era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear is whether these people always took their own steps completely on their own, or there was someone behind their throne who directed their actions towards predetermined goals.
It must be admitted that we are living in a period in which the world&#39;s wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that flows from it could not have happened in a single generation.
Among the astronomically rich families, one stands out, which could be considered as the head of an octopus (I don’t know if anyone is above them, but this is not excluded) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) already in the 90s of the 19th century in order to stop rumors linking their name with criminal activities in the higher spheres, in the shadow of which they were, and which always led to strengthening their power, increasing wealth, or both to both.
They have large stakes in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are waging or preparing war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi, only four were left, but at the same time, the Russian government took over the country&#39;s central bank).
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank for the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy started issuing his own money and wanted to abolish the FED (Federal Reserve System), was assassinated in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the FED for causing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their lust for world power from 1859 to 1871 led to the development of a plan for three world wars, created by the 33rd level Grand Mason Albert Pike.
The objective of the first war was to destroy the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy colonial domination, especially Great Britain, and the third should lead to a reduction in the world population to approximately 0.5-1 billion people (this number of slaves will be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury , and they will not consume many resources), the creation of a single universal religion (ecumenism cannot be anything but a prerequisite for such a project), and the final seizure of absolute power.
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is to provoke a crisis and then propose solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these solutions are false and always make matters worse (see the FED&#39;s founding, which was supposed to prevent a repeat of the crisis they caused in 1907).
Thus, after they managed to unleash the First World War through the assassination of the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia, starting the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with a sudden, militarily and economically unjustified capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, the Central European power, Austria-Hungary, was fragmented.
To facilitate the unleashing of World War II, bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation by imposing huge war reparations on Germany, which created the prerequisite for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it only remained to give the Germans a strong enough Leader to expose the guilty and offer simple solutions, then create a multinational Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority that should have played, and indeed did play, the function of a fifth column in kindling the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds instigated the founding of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historical Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began to occur.
There have been terrorist attacks from both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler escaped from the chains in which he was initially held by the bankers, or whether everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was formally founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by war reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create a hotbed of war three.
If international bankers manage to unleash it, the Jewish people, as in the Second World War, will become a victim of hostilities on the front line, now along with the Arab or, more simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a gigantic laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (just take a sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where resentment breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if everything began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish between the ordinary people of Israel and their leaders, because, like in our country, international bankers slip only their own candidates to vote in the elections.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist politician loyal to international bankers, doing everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran&#39;s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten escalate into a world conflict, and given Iran&#39;s control over the Strait of Hormuz, which contains 20% of the world&#39;s oil reserves (the shipping corridor is only 2 miles wide), will also lead to the destruction of the world economy.
In what light are the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994 now appearing: &quot;All we need is a general crisis, and people will accept a new world order.&quot;
The new world order in their view is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a handful of financial aristocracy who enjoy comfort.
A world where every born organism is implanted with a chip at birth, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he makes all small and large, rich and poor, free and slave, have a brand on their right hand or forehead, so that a person who is not marked with the name of that beast, or the number of his name, can neither buy nor sell.
This is the wisdom: everyone who has a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it corresponds to the name of a man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
The film &quot;Operation&quot; Argo &quot;: When it&#39;s worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the US embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the deposed Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the US, which had been his regime&#39;s patron for decades.
For the US administration, a positive outcome of the situation was not expected - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, because this could radically undermine the confidence of allies in other countries.
However, it was not able to achieve the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
This was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were finally released 444 days later, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
Their fate triggered a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter&#39;s defeat in the 1980 presidential election that ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, &quot;Argo&quot; describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After difficult ups and downs, they ended their journey at the residence of the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with Canadian authorities, succeeded in getting them out of Iran, helped by an extravagant cover story according to which they left on Canadian passports as members of a film crew looking for a place in the country to film a sci-fi epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by &quot;evacuation&quot; expert Tony Mendez, required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order for the legend to be true, specialized magazines wrote about the film project, press conferences were held, a fictional production company had a real office.
The details of the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film is based on the memoirs of Tony Mendez.
Affleck&#39;s film is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called &quot;film opus&quot;, the story of a successful undertaking, a scam - an example can be a series of films about Ocean&#39;s friends.
The film constantly changes moods - on the one hand, documented scenes from Tehran (the credits show iconic historical photographs of events and the way in which the same situations were shown in the film - there are no big differences).
On the other hand, lightweight Hollywood passages interspersed with irony and moderate exaggeration.
And then more scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discussing the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, on the phone ...
Ben Affleck did a great job restarting his career.
From a ridiculed actor, he became a respected director, and his game ceased to be an object of ridicule.
Operation Argo is his third feature film, following the dark detective Goodbye Baby Goodbye (2007) and the thriller City (2010).
At the same time, this is the first Affleck film that is not filmed in the director&#39;s hometown of Boston.
The sense of place is one of the qualities that raised the director&#39;s earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck shows it in &quot;Argo&quot;, where Tehran &quot;plays&quot; Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, reenacting real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy are impressive in their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unforeseenness that arise when history suddenly changes somewhere.
Affleck and his colleagues achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (a fake headquarters in the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the narrative does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite well with these few, sometimes thinking something out - it all comes out not so elegantly there (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents an impending crisis at the Tehran airport and the runway chase looks rather far-fetched).
Argo&#39;s downside is that it&#39;s distracted by having to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman as their Hollywood counterparts are indeed very charming, but their characters would have deserved more space, and they are far from the only ones in the film.
Affleck&#39;s film lacks a bit of drama, a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the production and the retro style that recreates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it&#39;s hard to grab.
However, this is enough to remind of one, still in a certain sense, living history, and also to testify to how exaggerated the notion of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services.
Balloon Rules, Bananas and the Circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for &quot;the most absurd regulation or project from the EU workshop&quot;.
&quot;We were spurred to this by the latest event, in which the EU plans to adopt a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,&quot; Patrick Nager, the organizer of the survey, told Pravo.
Among the absurdities already put forward for the nomination is the European Court&#39;s recent decision to combine premium rates for men and women.
Until now, women have benefited from life insurance because for insurance companies they are objectively less at risk.
&quot;Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be submitted by people before the end of this year.
The voting itself will take place until the end of February 2013,&quot; Nager said.
Controversial EU regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which as a result is harmful to nature, as well as the ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain relatively small amounts of hazardous substances, or the cage size directive for chickens, owing to what this year eggs have essentially risen in price .
Also criticized was the de facto ban on the use of the term &quot;sandwich butter&quot; or the removal of classic light bulbs from sale.
Quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of one or another trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by some state or group of states (thus the Czech Republic now defends the demands of its banks even under the threat of a veto).
The interests of the lobby are as follows: for example, top-quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show &quot;anomalous curvature.&quot;
At the same time, the European Commission justified itself by saying that it was only harmonizing the existing disparate national rules that complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, nevertheless softened the standards regarding fruits and vegetables, citing the fact that existing directives would lead to wastage of products.
A candidate for winning the poll could also be last year&#39;s EU regulation, according to which balloons sold must be provided with a warning that children under eight years old cannot inflate them without adult supervision.
The EU has turned to US studies showing that balloons are a potential cause of death in children through suffocation when played.
A similar restriction now applies to children under the age of 14, who are prohibited from blowing the fair&#39;s horns.
Funny ideas are born at home too
Quite absurd is the rule concerning European officials themselves: anyone holding any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name Macedonia, but must instead say &quot;FYROM&quot; (The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) .
The Bankovnípoplatky.com portal, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists &quot;Principle of non-intervention&quot; (Laissez Faire), proposed for voting, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks that can be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of canned mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
The organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having the sea, and the idea of providing subsidies for applying for subsidies.
But these ideas originated in Prague, not in Brussels.
&quot;We are at a disadvantage because we don&#39;t have the sea.
Let&#39;s ask the European Union for compensation,&quot; said in autumn 2004 the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSDP).
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain harvest, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses of stocks that had to be taken out.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to Palas, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
Subsidies for receiving subsidies were offered to villages by the Ministry for Regional Development, led by Minister Pavel Nemets (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies were to be used to draw up an application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are an exception
While rulings in member states are easily criticized, the EU&#39;s efforts to regulate and to make the EU function and develop more effectively are considered by many experts to be more recognizable.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the scooping of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have a hint of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which the member states have achieved when discussing the budget.
It also stirs emotions among Czechs that, like other EU countries, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, retained the name &quot;Olomouc cheese curds&quot;, however, &quot;Tuzemsky rum&quot;, the traditions of which in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to rename to &quot;Tuzemak&quot;.
Only products made from cane distillate, and not from sugar beets, can be called rum.
In addition to the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, marzipan from German Lübeck or Parma ham, the official list of registered EU products includes, for example, Karlovy Vary rusks, Pogorzelice and Trebon carp and Žatec hops.
Pardubice gingerbread and Hořice tubules can also be proud of the EU trademark.
People want me to protect the republic, but I&#39;m an amateur, says Okamura.
Mr. Senator, how does it occur to a person to run for president?
I don&#39;t think about becoming a senator or president myself.
If everything in our country functioned without problems, then I would not run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch how the country has been plundered over the past 20 years, how thieves are bustling about here, how taxes and the retirement age are being raised for people.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something that I don&#39;t like, I try to find a solution how to change it.
And since I&#39;m over forty years old and an independent person with no party affiliation, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You got into the Senate, but soon went to the presidential castle.
Are you turning your back on the people who chose you in this way?
I&#39;ve been saying all the time that I will join the fight for the presidential castle, depending on the result of the elections to the Senate.
Later, I clarified that if I was elected a senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a position, a position is a tool with which I can implement my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we, as a nation, grumble in our bar or at the TV, but at the same time we are ready to trample anyone who tries to change something.
Added to this are the media that denigrate a person and confuse freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, they said about me that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Jiri Paroubek.
Let&#39;s move on to your views.
You started the struggle for the presidential castle with theses on the material and criminal liability of politicians and on return property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You have no such power as president, and only the entire senate can propose laws.
How would you like to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for the tour to become a free enterprise, it was promoted.
The problem lies in politicking - when someone comes with a good offer from the left or right, he is deliberately obstructed, and this holds back the citizens.
As an independent non-partisan person, I have a much greater potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country and apply it without any sort of party ordering, without looking back at dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be more on the right or on the left?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people attribute me more to the left.
For me it doesn&#39;t matter at all - a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important for me that we move forward.
It&#39;s not about the fact that someone belongs to the right, and someone to the left, I want to unite people.
I will always support any decision that is good for the society, whether it is proposed by the CMCM or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea in the same way.
You get angry when someone says you are a populist.
But don&#39;t you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and vision.
And that&#39;s what you&#39;re trying to get closer to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals that I am talking about are already functioning in the world, or prominent experts are talking about them.
But without the support of the Parliament, you will be left with only slogans.
And with that, you won&#39;t last long in politics.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to implement criminal and material liability?
I have no other option.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to win them over to our side so that we get our way.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I will appeal to the chairmen of parliamentary parties with a call to legitimize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in case of refusal, will have to tell why they do not want it.
If there is a strong personality who will voice abuses, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was the merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to look for allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get majority support.
I try to promote things on my own; in the event that this fails, in six years I will finish and return to the private sector.
It kind of sounds like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I am no savior.
I know that I can&#39;t do anything alone, so I went around a number of well-known people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported the investigative journalist Yana Lorentsova, who uncovered fraud with light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really dissatisfied, but now I feel like I&#39;m on the scales.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the polls, and most of those who did went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two of us independents in the Senate.
The people have chosen the Senate in such a way that changes will be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Are you thinking of founding your own party?
I haven&#39;t thought about this yet, because I don&#39;t have time to check the purity of the background of every potential supporter, and I don&#39;t have the money to do so.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, I have only twenty thousand crowns in my transparent account.
Don&#39;t have money?
You&#39;re talking about property declarations, but how are you doing with that?
Personal property is estimated at approximately 60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment for 10 million, another apartment for 8 million, an art collection for about 10 million, an Aston Martin for 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb for a million, and a few million more. on account.
By the way, I got an Aston Martin because it was my boyish dream - I always liked James Bond, who drove a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive an Aston Martin, own $60 million worth of property and don&#39;t have any campaign money?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don&#39;t want to invest your own money in it.
It&#39;s not very convincing.
I don&#39;t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I get into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shows that my program is not that interesting.
And I don&#39;t have to pay for the campaign out of my own pocket.
The senatorial salary will basically cover my campaign expenses.
But I would not have lived on this money, for example, I could not pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I only wanted to earn money, I would not run anywhere.
So, you will continue to be engaged in entrepreneurship so that you can live?
Didn&#39;t you say you&#39;d cut back on this activity?
But this does not depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I partially reduced my activity.
For example, my deputy will become the managing director of a travel agency in the spring.
People would like me to be an unmercenary who would keep the republic.
But I also need something to live on.
How much, as an entrepreneur, are you used to getting monthly?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I get further.
And if I became president, I would finish my entrepreneurship.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday issue of the Pravo newspaper.
MVRDV architects prove that real adventures are not only in the imagination - with the example of Spijkenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
&quot;I find this building fun, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,&quot; says Lisette Verheig, a passer-by on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, says: &quot;No, this building is really beautiful.&quot;
But I ask myself: why do we need another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPads and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to such old-fashioned libraries these days, right?
Spijkenisse, an unremarkable bedroom town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this unfortunate circumstance, a decision was made several years ago to contribute to general education by building seven imaginary bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of beautifully painted miniatures made of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
Winy Maas of Rotterdam architecture firm MVRDV, a master of bold bar charts and witty, sometimes even cynical builds, took on the challenge with his usual equanimity and showed up at the 2003 competitive audition with five books under his arm and a smirk on his face.
And while the members of the jury looked around in puzzlement and shrugged their shoulders, the impudent Maas folded a pyramid of size from his original gift and ended his speech in defense of his project with the following words: &quot;Dear citizens!&quot;
Here it is, my proposal: &quot;Book Mountain&quot; in Spijkenisse, the so-called Buckenberg!
Nine years later, this €30 million mountain has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, a supermarket, a post office and several adjacent residential buildings and townhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
In early November, Book Mountain won second prize in the 2012 Dutch Library of the Year competition.
The project also participates in the national Dutch competition of wooden structures in 2012.
Thus, a faceless suburb that previously had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and a surprisingly ugly city hall, whose white facades suggest a dairy, has become richer by one modern piece of architecture.
But most importantly, the first public cultural building in the history of this town appeared in Spijkenisse.
Long road to the book
First impression: a bookish Eldorado under a cheese hood.
There is only one lift, passing through the center of the mountain range, because true fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glazed on all sides, the space is bright and easy to see, fired brick floors and elegant street lamps unmistakably create the feeling of a public city square.
The urban environment is recreated perfectly.
The gaze involuntarily searches for benches, dogs and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
&quot;Usually there are bookshelves along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark room, usually uncomfortable and featureless,&quot; says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic space configuration on its head and pulled the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the book mountain is skillfully used: offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and technical rooms are located in the center.
Particularly pleasing are the black bookshelves, which serve either as wall decoration, or as parapets, or as stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even sophisticated architects and civil engineers are at a loss as to what this unknown material is.
&quot;We wanted to work with recycled materials,&quot; explains Joop Trauborst, project manager representing the community of Spijkenisse, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once, at an agricultural enterprise in Friesland, we met a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, millimeter-thick artificial fibrous material has been used as root lining.
It&#39;s cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles last one or two seasons, after which they can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into panels four centimeters thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called landbauplastik (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells a little like a new car and a little sneaker.
There are 105 steps leading to the top.
Those who overcome the path of almost 500 meters will be rewarded in the literary cafe not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted tree ficuses.
They take care of the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct air humidity on the literary mountain.
The cost of a new soul
&quot;It&#39;s hard to believe, but this building, despite the many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,&quot; says Trowborst.
For its heating and cooling, the heat of the earth is used.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cover, even on clear days the sun only gets inside for a short time.
Wide glulam trusses, perpendicular to the glass façade, provide shade and absorb most of the sun&#39;s rays.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lisette Verheig was also already here.
As well as teacher of traditional Chinese medicine Cynthia Bogarde, who called Buckenberg &quot;the soul of Spijkenisse, which has long been missing.&quot;
Reason: A few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from their own collection.
These books were supposed to fill empty shelves on the shelves of the library, which was not yet fully stocked - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
Shelves are stacked to the top.
&quot;There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,&quot; says architect Winy Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation, now every resident is connected in some way to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it&#39;s just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV succeeded in solving the royal task, which in professional jargon is called the creation of an identity.
Spijkenisse wrote his literary history.
And let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for building an identity.
Szabo: Germans should play a bigger role
Germany abstained from voting on the recognition of Palestine.
In doing so, Berlin is teetering on a narrow diplomatic track, according to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signaled that it would vote against the Palestinian bid for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained from voting.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she also does not support the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - while not being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained in the vote on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
As a result, NATO passed this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yes it is.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, moving from a policy that, so to speak, was controlled by the United States, to a proper German foreign policy.
Additionally, the situation is complicated by the fact that the Europeans do not have a coherent common policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only groping for their role, but are on the way to a &quot;more normal&quot; foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy, which is pursued by France or Great Britain.
What exactly does &quot;normal&quot; foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
This is a readiness to take a position in one&#39;s national interests that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and ties with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany&#39;s economic interests are very different from those of other large states, and therefore Germany must protect its own interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, in particular in the states of the Persian Gulf.
Therefore, she needs to be careful not to offend the public and elites in the Arab countries.
In any case, it plays its part.
But I wouldn&#39;t put too much emphasis on it, it&#39;s not a completely one-way connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany damaged its relationship with the US by abstaining from important decisions such as the Palestine vote?
I am sure that in Europe and even in the USA understanding of the German position prevails.
Therefore, I do not think that it was the same dramatic breakdown as in the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain a certain respect in this way.
After all, this signals that it should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that its interests should be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different opinions about the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, was clearly in favor of the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the US and many European states?
Because of American domestic politics, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration, at heart, has a sufficient understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant differences of opinion are not nearly as great as they always appear to be.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu&#39;s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand, and its position as a key partner in the EU on the other?
I think this is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be somewhat easier for the Germans if there were a single, non-contradictory European policy, but now this is not the case.
Therefore, they cannot act within the framework of a broader approach and are forced instead to act based only on their own vision of the situation.
This is exactly what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take the lead in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, if only because of ties with Israel.
This topic has always been a touchy one.
But I think it&#39;s clear to the Germans that they need to play a more independent role.
If Germany itself sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take on a major role?
Or is the leading role still hard for Germany?
Germany is not yet accustomed to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still always difficult for her to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany assumes an important role, all sorts of anti-German feelings emerge.
It&#39;s not easy for the Germans to deal with this.
Actually, this is an old problem: you don&#39;t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must take into account a variety of neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the US in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, then who is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a larger role.
Even if you don&#39;t like it, it&#39;s unpleasant, or it intensifies dislike for you - such is life!

&quot;Trademark protection&quot; in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is too.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms from whose names it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original titles file a claim.
But even then it is not clear whether they will be able to defend their rights.
&quot;Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,&quot; says Thomas Puttloch, a Taylor Wessing attorney who specializes in trademark infringement in the Far East.
A new case of this kind appears on my desk every week.
It is enough for imitators to add just a couple of letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci you get Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German enterprises are legally copied, for example, the sports goods manufacturer Puma.
Puttloch opens a folder of records from the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma there, an artificial name that also uses the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property rights.
In big cities there are high-rise department stores selling almost exclusively fakes.
However, Pattlech&#39;s affairs are not like that. On behalf of his trustees, he opposes allowing Chinese businesses to formally obtain from the Trademark Office the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it &quot;bang mingpai&quot;, the passenger mark.
This word is associated with &quot;ban dakuan&quot;.
So called women who hunt for rich men.
Chinese authorities plead not guilty
&quot;It&#39;s damaging to business and needs to be addressed,&quot; Pattloch said.
&quot;The brand is diluted, the unique position is lost, the image suffers greatly.&quot;
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries run into the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
With sales of €15 billion a year, China is the third largest and fastest growing luxury market, according to market research firm CLSA.
However, it is difficult and expensive to achieve the removal of questionable entries in the trademark registry.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Puttloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed claims because, after a long time, the challenged name became &quot;a reality of the market.&quot;
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarizer for damaging his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with construction machinery manufacturer Sany, a company that had recently acquired concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use an emblem that looks like a Mercedes star.
The Geely company that bought Volvo initially used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
Fashion maker Lacoste lost out in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, whose famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to blame.
The CTMO Trademark Office in Beijing confirms that there were difficulties in 2010 due to a shortage of staff and facilities.
But in the last year there has been a &quot;return from an emergency in the working process to the norm.&quot;
Thus, the number of pending objection cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases were closed, up 75 percent from last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending before the Office.
It&#39;s costly to fight this.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark protection applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive time, the agency said.
The same applies to the total number of valid trademarks, 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were paid.
To simplify, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to protest, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against the Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that their illegal production of counterfeit car parts was eliminated.
However, the imitator secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
It was an omission of its own, as last names are not protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialties in Munich.
And the trademark registration office CTMO rejected the Munich claim.
True, Freudenberg won in both subsequent instances, but the opposing side continues to fight until now.
Need to be alert
The issue is currently pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: &quot;The process is extremely expensive and takes us a lot of time, money and nerves.&quot;
Internal costs are hardly amenable to accounting, the archive of the company even had to look through the acts of a hundred years ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a &quot;large six-figure sum in euros&quot; for a settlement.
&quot;It&#39;s clear how much this is costing us,&quot; says Wentzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spread even to Europe.
Namely, if imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather goods.
The concern stopped production in these areas a long time ago, but despite this, it was able to prevent registration.
&quot;You have to be on the lookout,&quot; says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German businesses be very careful with China.
It&#39;s not enough to rely on international trademark protection provisions, rather foreigners should &quot;anything worth protecting in any way be registered in China as well,&quot; Wentzler says.
Otherwise, it can cost much more than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the last act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the other party license fees for his own name, Wentzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be squeezed out of the market in a controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: stomp, sing, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir is rehearsing - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The history of relationships that covered a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, there is a stomping sound: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men&#39;s slippers pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One two three four.
Only after that the voices of the singers slowly grow - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they advance, enchant and follow each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, nearly jumps out of his cloth shoes as he leads them with supple and expressive gestures.
Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbonga choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty members of the choir from 23 to 69 years old came to the rehearsal, from a specialist in human genetics to a janitor.
&quot;Om&quot; Obani &quot;is not an easy thing, each voice of the choir has its own text, moreover, in a completely alien language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Help for self help
Unaids, the United Nations AIDS program, estimates that there are about 34 million people living with HIV in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni, Voices for Africa has found mentors in Germany.
70 of them attend a school preparing for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month, you can take on patronage.
It guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means teller or praiser.
Bantu is not spoken fluently in this hall, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this alien soft language and from time to time even brings them back to where they first appeared: to the south of Africa.
Indeed, at a distance of 8733 kilometers of summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitzheni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent infected
About 2,000 people live there, some still live in simple mud and straw huts, and there are many children among the inhabitants.
More than 300 of them were left without parents who died from the HIV virus.
Esitjeni mirrors the disease of Swaziland in miniature: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Male circumcision, which has been shown to cut the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the general public.
More than forty percent of the population of Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
The chorus discovered this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, the Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothes, education.
Without a school education, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first it was a private commitment of individual participants to send a child to school for a few euros a year and give him the opportunity to receive a hot meal once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the &quot;Voices for Africa&quot; association, which since then almost professionally takes care of AIDS orphans in Esitgeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Pediculosis pubis and scabies are both parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of every five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydial infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea, and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low in our country - however, about 20 percent of new HIV infections occur in this group.
Among young people, chlamydial infections are significantly more common than among other population groups.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Among our youth, the human papillomavirus is also common.
How is the number of infections changing?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011, according to the Robert Koch Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is about one tenth less than the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases may cause ulcers in the genital area, complaints when urinating, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, and blisters or lumps.
However, often they are not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
Indeed, in part, the causative agents of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread through contact infection and through close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examination, especially with frequent changes in sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, most STIs can be cured and long-term consequences can be avoided.
Patronage, donations and last but not least the fees for the choir&#39;s performances all over Germany allow us to collect something.
&quot;In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitgeni,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village itself, Tsodva Dlamini, a conscientious and active woman, manages the money from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well settled, for example, with one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as old women are called in Zulu, is the pillar of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that children in uniform show up to class on time every day.
Those with no relatives left go to the shelter of Khanisila, a single woman who receives a salary from the association, as well as two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa set up a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and partnered with the American health organization PSI to organize HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but they prefer to remain silent about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country.
King with 14 wives
&quot;AIDS is an absolute taboo,&quot; says Annette Lennartz, &quot;because it is linked to sexuality.&quot;
Quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excess.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, this state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the rapid spread of the HIV virus in past years.
But it also lies with the itinerant workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally everywhere, says Annette Lennartz, “but they are almost never used.
Another culture is flesh to flesh.&quot;
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogni Choir tours southern Africa every two or three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black identity, which many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of whites who sing songs in the black language - such a confession not only brings good mood and joy, but even happened to bring tears to the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitzheni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Despite the fact that the small village can hardly be found on the map, it is more than known in the Etsulveni river valley.
&quot;Go to Esitzheni, there is light,&quot; the local people say.
And after the 8,733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, as the stomping singers return to the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you can see that light is on here as well.
Messenger: NASA opens ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover can be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the Sun, it also has frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that a permanently shadowed region of the planet is covered in ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Presumably, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one connects the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the probe&#39;s scientific director Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building blocks of life got to other places in the solar system.
Unbeknownst to the inhabitants of the Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as Phoenix, explore the depths of the Universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows into the infinite distance.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
Eight planets in our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a &quot;planet&quot; by the International Astronomical Union&#39;s 2006 new definition.
This fragment of an infrared image from the Spitzer telescope presents a &quot;family portrait&quot; of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink &quot;newborn&quot; stars in the stellar circle.
This star-forming region - unromantically referred to by scientists as W5 - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This iridescent glow of a dying star was photographed by NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-like ring is made up of material that the star threw out during its dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are emerging from gas and dust.
NASA&#39;s Spitzer Telescope took this photo of a galactic delivery room.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, the colors are better with a telescope.
How the red eye winks at the observer is the Helix Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light years in the constellation of Aquarius.
The resemblance to the terrestrial continent has earned this nebula the nickname &quot;North America&quot;.
The combination of normal and infrared photography produces vibrant colors.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came into being is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are fragments of the moon of Saturn, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of Hubble&#39;s greatest and clearest images yet: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color reproduction, images of spiral galaxies turn into real works of art.
An image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula, several thousand light-years away, in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifidus comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-parted, tripartite), as dark stripes of dust divide the red-hot heart of the cradle of stars into three parts.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers photographed the harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies rush towards each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who don&#39;t like technical abbreviations may refer to it by the nickname &quot;Southern Pinwheel&quot;.
A photograph from the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, 1,400 light-years away, is composed of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images from various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed for NASA by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the large spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cradle is constantly creating new stars.
This star cloud, connected to the Rosette Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars - at a distance of 5000 light-years from Earth.
This brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole has no dust yet, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it arose shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our Views of the Universe: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope was probably invented in 1608 by Hans Lippershey - even before Galileo Galilei started observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become larger - and the spaces accessible to their gaze are deeper.
For 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror pictured here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the &quot;Large Binocular Telescope&quot; is installed.
It allows you to look into space using two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
&quot;Gran Telescopio Canarias&quot; has a gigantic internal structure - the diameter of the mirror alone is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the &quot;Large South African Telescope&quot; in South Africa is segmented - for the sake of cost reduction.
Nevertheless, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fastened at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberle Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light gathering ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the world&#39;s largest telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is a &quot;Very large telescope&quot; - fully consistent with its name.
Its four mirrors make it possible to illuminate even the mid-infrared spectrum in the spotting scope.
ESO&#39;s Chilean Observatory is also planning to install a European Very Large Telescope.
Its main mirror should stretch for as much as 42 meters - and will be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which, along with them, also looks into the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror with a diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can admire the illustrations.
However, the most important views from space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been delivering paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been looking for planets outside the solar system - primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photograph shows the final preparations for the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space no earlier than 2018 aboard an Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must look for the Big Bang by the light of the first stars and galaxies.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the Messenger rotates closer to the planet&#39;s north pole.
Radar measurements for decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists are now sure of it.
Drink oil every day - and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically respectable age.
There is even a longevity museum here.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old elders seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically respectable age.
There is even a longevity museum here.
The search for clues in a country where 97-year-old elders seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh mountains can be called wild and romantic.
The minibus rumbles along a winding road past densely forested hills, raging rivers and simple peasant houses.
Everything around is so green and bright that you might think that you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the southernmost region of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
Talysh live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak excellent Farsi and Azerbaijani and are distinguished by longevity.
The final destination is Lerik.
The small town boasts too ponderous Soviet-era architecture, which does not harmonize with the picturesque mountain landscape at all.
Tourists from Europe almost never come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
It takes eight hours for 323 kilometers, as the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth, which the country owes to the oil of the Caspian Sea, has not yet reached the provinces.
However, Pilata Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has something to interest tourists.
&quot;In May, Baku became famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the world&#39;s oldest people,&quot; says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Longevity Museum, probably the only one in the world.
The biography of about eight dozen Talysh from these places, which are more than 100 years old, is documented here. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photograph.
This is my grandfather, he is 120 years old here.
At the age of 136, he had another child
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Shirali Myuslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And taking into account the fact that the oldest person, whose age is confirmed by documents, is 122 years old, Myuslyumov&#39;s age seems extremely doubtful.
&quot;He was born in the area in 1805 and died in 1973,&quot; explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times, and he had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
So did the shepherd Myuslyumov add a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, heard about centenarians in Central Asia.
&quot;An astonishingly large number of elderly people can also be found in parts of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,&quot; says Scholz, &quot;an extremely large number of very old people also live in Sardinia.&quot;
However, due to the lack of documentation, scientific confirmation of the age is not possible as there were no civil registers.
Every day a glass of ghee
However, it is a fact that people in the Lerik region reach biblical age with astonishing frequency.
Now 20 people over 100 years old live here.
Why are there so many centenarians here in the south?
Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulaeva, on the other hand, believes that it&#39;s about food.
Talish people love meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of melted butter every day. However, it is unlikely that such a high-calorie diet can be healthy from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it a primitive way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzoyeva lives in Chengemiran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik.
At 97, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons and the daughter of Mirzayeva, who have long had their grandchildren.
There are also two small children jumping nearby.
Tea is prepared in the kitchen and served in typical armudu pot-bellied glasses.
Mirzayeva has perfectly even and strong white teeth, under a headscarf she hides long dark blond braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always wash my hair with milk so it never falls out and keeps the color.
&quot;And I&#39;ve never used shampoo,&quot; says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never shopped in a grocery store in my entire life.
She then talks about her husband, who served in the army.
The hardest part was after World War II.
But it got better when &quot;beloved father&quot; Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
Propaganda is not often heard in the speech of an old woman.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, practically knows no borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, then his son Ilham took over the reins.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among Azerbaijani old people.
Mirzayeva receives 230 manats (approximately equal to the same amount of euros) as a monthly pension, which, for local conditions, is an amount on which one can live well.
And, perhaps, Mirzayeva&#39;s long-grown son is also right: &quot;Old people in our culture are deeply respected.&quot;
They live in a large family, are loved, cared for and happy.
Why not stay alive as long as possible
The word &quot;human right&quot; is missing from the constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo testify to the country&#39;s deep division.
The future constitution, based on Sharia, met with a fierce rebuff.
The Egyptian president did not skimp on pathos.
We have to create a transition.
&quot;And its success is my responsibility to the people and to God,&quot; he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire nation, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state on the Nile is at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologetically, said that he had temporarily curtailed the competence of the constitutional court and expanded his competence &quot;in order to save the revolution.&quot;
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is not entirely clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be abolished?
In fact, 234 articles got through in the overnight 15-hour steeplechase at the Islamist-leaning 100-member constitutional convention, and this is partly worrisome.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that the judiciary is based on the &quot;principles of Islamic law.&quot;
But what does &quot;principles&quot; mean?
This was and still is a matter of interpretation, and one fears that the Islamists will use the vague language and the resulting legal leeway to interpret sharia more strictly.
At least one new article hints at this: in all matters relating to Sharia, Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamist institution in the country, enjoying great authority in all Sunni Islam, should be involved in the advice.
This should not, but may mean, that the clergy oversee the legislation, which would de facto have the effect of limiting the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is subject to interpretation
One more problem: the jurisdiction of civilians to the military court should be preserved.
These courts during the period of Mubarak&#39;s rule served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were in military custody.
Also, as stated in the project, the state must protect the &quot;true essence of the Egyptian family&quot; and &quot;support its morality and values.&quot;
Legally, this is formulated so vaguely that state institutions with the help of this article will be able to control even the content of cinema and literature.
In clear text, this means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes the equality of men and women.
But the other prohibits insulting and defamation of the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that &quot;insulting people&quot; is prohibited is also doubtful.
Will a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer be enough?
It&#39;s a matter of interpretation, as is much in this draft that Morsi is offering for signature, and which he says will &quot;very soon&quot; be submitted to the Egyptians for a referendum.
&quot;The Revolution is Back&quot;
For weeks now, opposition has been forming against Islamist supremacy.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity Friday evening in Cairo&#39;s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could go into effect.
&quot;The revolution is back and we will win,&quot; said Hamdeen Sabbahi, who finished third in the presidential election.
Mohammed ElBaradei, Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the international agency for atomic energy, said the draft constitution belongs &quot;in the dustbin of history.&quot;
Through Twitter&#39;s short news service, he accused Morsi loyalists of wanting to lead a &quot;putsch against democracy.&quot;
&quot;If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and throw him off,&quot; opposition leader Yasser Said said.
&quot;We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet avenged,&quot; Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to observe the referendum, which would render it invalid.
&quot;The Quran is our constitution&quot;
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for an opposite demonstration, but as a precaution, not in Tahrir Square, but after mass prayer on the other side of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of veiled women and Salafi adherents who shouted: &quot;The people demand the application of God&#39;s law.&quot;
They demanded from Morsi: &quot;Clean the country!&quot; and assured: &quot;The Quran is our constitution.&quot;
The struggle for power over the symbolic square where it all began provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi&#39;s followers were clearly reluctant to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clear.
Now it&#39;s time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
The majority is for the Islamist project, it is considered a settled matter.
&quot;The concept of &quot;human rights&quot; is never mentioned&quot;
Hafiz Abu Saeda is furious at this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) has defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were imprisoned or put on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible for him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words &quot;human rights&quot; never appear in the new constitution, he regrets in an interview with &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;.
The expansion of Morsi&#39;s influence on all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
&quot;Instead of strengthening the civil state, the president de facto annulled it,&quot; Saeda laments.
After all, without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has abandoned him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be retribution for this.
A demonstrator in Tahrir Square warns: &quot;You are creating a monster that you cannot control.&quot;
Norwegian rakfisk: the most foul-smelling fish in the world?
Norway&#39;s population of five million has one of the highest standards of living not only in Europe but throughout the world.
Perhaps the secret of this country&#39;s success has something to do with the local addiction to one extremely fetid fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a pile of dirty and sweaty sportswear.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get the smell of rakfisk, one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies, that is repulsive to the senses.
I am in a small town called Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
Scenic views all around covered with snow. It is very beautiful, but an indestructible characteristic smell is poured into the air.
Rakfisk is a trout sprinkled with salt and wandered in the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of darling you need to achieve.
As dusk falls and it gets colder, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes dedicated to this very, shall we say, exciting dish.
&quot;It&#39;s eaten raw and washed down with a shot of aquavit, the local caraway vodka,&quot; explains Havard Halvarsen, a local fireman and part-time &quot;Rakfi general&quot; who runs the festival.
All around us, people are eating fish cut into small cubes and washing it down with large portions of alcohol.
&quot;Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,&quot; says Havard.
This drink is able to kill the smell.
I&#39;m trying a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - not much different from a portion of sushi that you carried with you on the bus for a long time.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from a completely different time, the time of poverty, when, even before the advent of refrigerators, fish was soaked in hermetically sealed barrels of salt water in the fall.
Then, in late winter, when the fish had already fermented well and thoroughly, it was taken out and, having muffled the perception with alcohol, was eaten.
Even in the memory of the past generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants who are attracted here by jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (an old rival, and not so long ago, a much more prosperous neighbor) come here en masse to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as a kind of important symbol, an indispensable, albeit somewhat stinking element of Norway&#39;s past.
This is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will set you back £9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in world news, and most of the country&#39;s inhabitants seem to be fine with that.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist and extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called &quot;what happened on July 22.&quot;
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway&#39;s current prosperity is based on the growth (since the early seventies) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
&quot;But oil is not the only reason for our prosperity,&quot; says Anna, our waitress, serving trays of aged rakfisk, a woman with long blond hair and striking blue eyes, the epitome of Nordic prosperity.
We are such a people - as you call it - reasonable.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don&#39;t like to show off, we&#39;re not boastful.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the income of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was throwing away money they didn&#39;t have, Norway carefully calculated all the costs.
&quot;As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, that&#39;s enough for happiness,&quot; says Anna.
&quot;And there&#39;s rakfisk,&quot; she adds with a carefree laugh.
I&#39;m standing in the snow in line for some food - I&#39;ve had enough rakfisk.
Here is a hamburger with elk meat - this is certainly exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
My hotel hosts a special Rakfisk Dinner, during which visitors vote to determine the best or perhaps the most flavorful fish.
There is a live TV broadcast showing the presenter in a bow tie, surrounded by plates of rakfisk.
It&#39;s like the Eurovision Song Contest.
&quot;So, Tor-Jurgen, what grade did you give for the best fish there in your mountains?&quot;
&quot;Yes, Howard, here&#39;s our estimate&quot;....
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls out of their chair, possibly over the aquavit.
Or maybe just inhaling the smell of this fish.
Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has a tough start to his career.
As newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to take a look at the challenges he will face and the mixed expectations of his country&#39;s population.
Traffic in Mexico City is now in a particularly deplorable state.
The city is congested at the best of times, and steel barriers have been erected since Monday, cutting off several key highways to the capital and causing havoc on the roads.
However, this was not done to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, the new head of Mexico, Enrique Peña Nieto, will put on the presidential sling and take over the reins of the country.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has done well under the outgoing Felipe Calderón administration, but the country is mired in a war on drugs that has claimed about 60,000 lives in six years.
&quot;My government declares to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,&quot; Mr. Peña Nieto told US President Barack Obama earlier this week in the Oval Office of the White House.
I&#39;m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal.
Prior to these announcements alongside the President of the United States, Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s political career developed as governor of his home state of Mexico City.
In his homeland, in a densely populated and vast state surrounding the capital of the country, opinions about the new leader were divided.
Straightforward person
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, he is fondly remembered.
Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort sector and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Peña Nieto, which are very different from the pothole roads that were previously in this place.
Plaques with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
&quot;We pin our hopes on him for real and serious change,&quot; says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman for Peña Nieto&#39;s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that our country desperately needs, primarily in the areas of security and economic development.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after his 12-year absence from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Peña Nieto.
In addition, he refutes the accusations of lack of content that the opposition has put forward to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very dedicated to bringing his vision of the country&#39;s future to life.
This is an excellent statesman, and, above all, a person who knows how to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea of the former governor.
The municipality of Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under highway overpasses, it is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality are also the harsh nature of this metropolis.
Troops were brought in earlier this year to quell drug gangs in these areas; and violence against women is particularly acute here.
In a wasteland near a vast dump, only in the last two years, several dozen bodies of murdered women have been discovered.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico State during Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s governorship, far more than in the infamous violent city of Ciudad Juarez, which has become a household name when it comes to killing innocent women.
Mr. Peña Nieto&#39;s opponents say that, at best, he could be said to have failed to deal with the problem of killing women during his term as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
Irinea Buendía, a resident of a concrete house similar to most of the houses in this dilapidated area, struggles to hold back her tears as she shows me pictures of her late daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her boyfriend killed her.
&quot;When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed beforehand,&quot; Ms Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she had been beaten and her body was already stiff.
Mariana&#39;s mother retells the story, and her daughter&#39;s portrait looks down on us from the wall, where it hangs next to a crucifix with just one word: justice.
This, they say, was denied to this family.
“State officials treated me like an old gossip, a disgruntled troublemaker.
They want people to just take everything they say and keep quiet.
But this is wrong, it is impossible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around,&quot; she says.
Wearing the presidential baldric on Saturday, President Peña Nieto will take on a heavy responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violent crime, and the new president has pledged to make addressing the issue a priority during his term.
&quot;Hopefully he will be exactly the same president that he was governor,&quot; says Olvera, a PRI congressman from Valle de Bravo.
However, this is precisely what the families of the victims in Ciudad Nessa fear most.
Bradley Manning did not complain about the mistreatment, the prosecution says.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning&#39;s claims of poor detention conditions.
During the hearing, increased attention was paid to Manning&#39;s stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning&#39;s conditions of detention were cruel.
A private in the US Army is accused of stealing several thousand secret documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to show that Pvt. Bradley Manning, charged with the biggest leak of classified material in US history, failed to take multiple opportunities to file a complaint about the mistreatment he said he endured while in military prison.
During cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, Attorney-General Major Ashden Fane stated that records of Manning&#39;s weekly visits by prison officials during his nine months in Quantico, Virginia contained no complaints of mistreatment.
Cross-examination in defense of Manning&#39;s motion to dismiss Manning&#39;s case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and sufficient punishment in themselves took place the day after Manning stated that while in custody he intended to commit suicide .
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 is accused of stealing several thousand classified documents while serving in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
The WikiLeaks resource has not confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday&#39;s hearing, Attorney Fein reviewed with Manning the reports filed following administration visits to Manning while he was in Quantico Prison, where he was held under high-security conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Attorney Fane asked Friday about the reports, Manning admitted that he felt &quot;excellent&quot; in his treatment of himself by the prison administration and &quot;very professionally organized.&quot;
The reports reviewed do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite the fact that Manning was asked directly about the conditions of his detention, Fein claims.
Manning responded that he had expressed verbal concerns about these issues and that visiting administration officials had discussed the issues with him and stated that they would be dealt with, but did not put it in writing.
&quot;They wrote down &#39;no problems&#39; (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn&#39;t mean I didn&#39;t bring it up in the conversation,&quot; says Manning.
The military judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his mistreatment in January 2011 during a panel meeting that considered suicidal intent, which he expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that during that meeting, he wanted to have his &quot;injury prevention&quot; regime lifted and the conditions of his imprisonment softened.
Military officials explained that the restricted regime of confinement - a level lower than that of supervised suicide prevention - was put in place for the protection of the prisoner as well as for the safety of others.
&quot;I wanted to let the administration know that I&#39;m fine so that they can lift the injury prevention regime ... so that my standard of living improves, from my point of view,&quot; Manning explained.
On Thursday, Manning testified about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to a prison at the naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had suicidal thoughts in Kuwait and that he once passed out due to extreme heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not allowed to know how your fate is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
&quot;My world has shrunk to Camp Arifjan, to the size of my prison,&quot; Manning said on Thursday.
&quot;I thought I would die in this cage.&quot;
While in Quantico, Manning, he said, spent most of his time in the small cell - at least 21 hours, and often even more than 23 hours a day - all alone.
Manning reports that he was only allowed to keep a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, a few pieces of clothing, and glasses.
He says that he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying down during the daytime was against the rules.
According to Manning, while sleeping, his eyes were constantly hit by light penetrating from outside the cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he rolled over in bed at night, then, according to him, he was woken up and forced to roll over on his back.
Manning&#39;s lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning&#39;s mistreatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Also on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made during Thursday&#39;s testimony that after being forced to sleep naked in his cell at Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other inmates. at the morning check.
Manning stated that he was not able to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
When questioned by the judge on Friday, Manning said he understood from the guard&#39;s order that he should throw in a blanket to cover himself with, but admitted that no one had directly ordered him to throw it.
On Thursday, Manning said he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning reported that he told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underpants or flip flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from his cell.
His lawyers are hoping that the judge will at least take into account what he went through while incarcerated and significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court due to start hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to ask Manning to plead guilty to lesser crimes and challenge the other charges as excessive.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend, with the prosecution expected to insist that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was held at Quantico in accordance with the rules governing the detention of detainees with the maximum strict regime.
Manning&#39;s charges include aiding an adversary, unlawfully facilitating public disclosure on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing government property or documents.
If he is convicted on all counts of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My National Identity Crisis is a Mexican-American story.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who leave because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Rubén Navarette believes American Mexicans are torn between two cultures.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I walked down the arrivals corridor, approached the border control area, and froze in place.
The signs indicated two queues: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in central California and have been called Mexican all my life.
It&#39;s just a convention, like my friends in Boston call themselves Irish and my friends in New York call themselves Italian.
Later, I settled on the complicated &quot;Mexican American&quot; design.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather&#39;s homeland, there was no need for conventional names or complex structures.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask or answer questions.
But my vocabulary is poorer than that of native speakers, and I can&#39;t get rid of my American accent.
So I took out my American passport and got in line for the Extranjeros.
I was reminded of this story a few days ago when newly elected Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were issues familiar to the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Peña Nieto spoke eagerly of the rise of the Mexican economy, which would now just as well allow Mexicans to stay in Mexico instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the US and Canada and create a kind of North American trading bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Peña Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no concrete proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and old grievance issue.
Most Americans never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders at gunpoint to give up half of their territory.
But Mexicans think in centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as any US statesman utters even a word of criticism towards Mexico, complaints are immediately heard in the press and among the elite of Mexican society that the Americans encroach on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with militancy.
Mexico&#39;s relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States is the most difficult.
Do you want to talk about resentment?
They are enough.
There are winners and losers in Mexico, people who find opportunities in this country and those who don&#39;t.
There are so many people of Mexican origin in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio for one reason only: at some point in their family history, someone - a father or grandfather - did not have the opportunity to fulfill himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often they were Mexicans of a certain type - swarthy, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants and we remember this.
In Mexico it is seen differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we went to good schools and got good jobs, but we must not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
USA.
In addition, we know that the majority of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us like second class people, like fake Mexicans.
We don&#39;t speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico aren&#39;t strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not now find ourselves behind a silk curtain, having found a well-fed life in the USA, but having lost spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and moved legally to the US as a child, and it reminds me that there are certain tensions between real Mexicans and Mexican Americans - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Mexican Americans are hurt by this.
She is a US citizen and believes she belongs to both of these countries.
At the same time, many of the Mexican Americans I know don&#39;t feel like they belong to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
In Mexico we are Americans.
And in the US they call us Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations weren&#39;t complicated enough, some Mexican leaders and intellectuals want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Mexican Americans to serve as a kind of ambassador for Mexico and represent her interests in the US.
We could tell our American friends what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah of course.
Nothing will come of it.
Too many hurts in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not think this country is all that beautiful.
Sorry, but deal with this yourself, amigos.
And this is fair.
If some Mexicans still cannot forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they will also have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by how their relatives were treated in Mexico just recently. .
Yeah.
We probably have more in common than I thought.
Old battles in the new Middle East
Ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could be a fragile foundation for further peace
Is lasting peace between Arabs and Israelis possible in the Middle East?
Another round of bloodshed pushes the conclusion that such hopes are futile.
There are familiar, meaningless disputes about who started it first; many buildings turned into ruins; over 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis were killed; For the first time during the conflict, rockets fired from the Gaza Strip fell in the vicinity of the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians are hopelessly mired in their age-old conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated in different ways, but the events of the &quot;Arab spring&quot; swirled in a rebellious storm many established realities, and the Palestinians and Israelis did not manage to stay away from the whirlwind that shook the region.
Perhaps as a result, their fight will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that give hope for a way out of this deadly impasse.
War without winners
At first glance, the current situation does not give grounds for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 is implemented, this week&#39;s clashes have only strengthened the positions of security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist movement Hamas, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, will say that they forced Israel to retreat despite the losses they suffered.
Despite the fact that some of the leaders of the group were destroyed, and 1.7 million inhabitants are blocked in one of the most densely populated and problematic corners of our planet, Israel failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity in the West Bank, another Palestinian territory now controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well come to the conclusion that time is on their side.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new powerful and wealthy friends.
A resurgent regional leader Turkey, once Israel&#39;s closest Muslim ally, has come out in support of Hamas; Qatar, one of the richest and fastest growing states in the Persian Gulf, followed suit.
Triumphant Hamas supporters claim an Islamist crescent around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, ruled by the paramilitary group Hezbollah, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to topple Bashar al-Assad, and on to Jordan, where the king&#39;s power is threatened by allies. Hamas.
The most significant shift in the balance of power in the region has occurred on Israel&#39;s southern borders, in the most populous and important Arab country, Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood&#39;s influence has grown stronger under President Mohammed Morsi.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was ousted in 2011, was a secular dictator with little support for Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, by contrast, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more populist.
In future diplomatic alignments, Hamas could become a significant player whose voice cannot be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, hardliners in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas was defeated.
The Israeli Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the missiles launched by Hamas.
Israeli citizens can sleep peacefully, at least for a while.
As far as diplomacy is concerned, the US remained true to its unchanged position; many European countries have also placed the blame for starting the latest round of violence on Hamas.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although approximately 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from Gaza since 2004, Israel has managed to minimize the problem of suicide bombings, in part by building a wall that extends into the West Bank, a large part of the unrecognized Palestinian states - and protects Jewish settlements that continue to expand despite the illegality of such actions from the point of view of international law.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for elections scheduled for January 22 - has teamed up with even more aggressive conservatives under the leadership of Avigdor Lieberman, is quite comfortable.
What is the point of pandering to the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If you give them all the power in the West Bank, will they not launch rockets from there towards Israel, as their counterparts in the Gaza Strip do?
It&#39;s best to keep them behind a wall and firmly suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will win; however, their calculations may be refuted by the Arab Spring.
While the Islamists who come to power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be internal problems.
Israel&#39;s defense budget is larger than that of all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of Egyptian President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama for a ceasefire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, no less, must consider the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic changes take place in the Arab countries, the loss of the Palestinian right to self-determination is a time bomb that will explode sooner or later in the Israeli-occupied territories, like the bus bombing in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression is already undermining the foundations of the democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect - the growth of the Arab population - only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to pay with the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need external momentum
There remains the only solution that sound-minded representatives on both sides, as well as most of the rest of the world and our newspaper, are constantly calling for: the formation of two states and Israeli cessions of territory in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not very impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to more effectively influence the parties to the conflict.
Egypt, long overdue for its decision to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, are better positioned than ever to persuade Hamas to recognize the boundaries of the Jewish state, adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fatah.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming UN vote, which could result in the recognition of a virtual statehood of Palestine.
President Obama also has a role to play in bringing Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never submitted his own peace plan.
After returning to the White House, he still demonstrates an unwillingness to get involved in solving this problem.
This is a catastrophically short-sighted position.
The United States has a vital interest in stability in the Middle East.
This is only possible if there is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Packaging for Cigarettes Act has come into force.
Health warnings and images of diseased body parts stand out on dull green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
Australia&#39;s first-ever Uniform Packaging Act for cigarettes and tobacco products has gone into effect, replacing brand logos and color schemes with a dreary olive-colored box with eerie pictures of diseased body parts and images of children whose health is undermined by their parents&#39; smoking.
In addition to various pictures and inscriptions warning about the dangers of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced without fail from this Saturday, is the names of the brands, which are printed in the same small print.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for the packaging of tobacco products.
The Australian federal government says the measure is intended to keep young people from smoking by removing the habit from fashionable status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26, in 99 cases out of 100, never become smokers.
“It is clear that even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging design,” explains Minister of Health Tanja Plibersek, referring to studies showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated in children with the idea of a princess. .
Australia is one of the world&#39;s lowest smoking countries, so these changes will not affect the profits of multinational corporations much, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies argue that this will only increase the share of the black market, which will sell cheap and affordable cigarettes.
&quot;This law will lead to serious consequences, different from those that were conceived by its initiators,&quot; said Scott McIntyre, a representative of British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit products from China and Indonesia will supply many more of these products for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, new laws contribute to business growth.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, says demand for cigarette cases and silicone cases that hide nasty pictures on the packaging has skyrocketed (virtually from nothing) since the likes of British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost their case in the Australian High Court to challenge the law.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and is waiting for a new batch.
This is good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely the part of the population that these measures are aimed at.
After the adoption of a series of laws in Australia that made television advertising of cigarettes and their support of sporting events illegal, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a conspicuous place, tobacco advertising has moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local businesses and websites from advertising online, but it cannot restrict overseas sites from doing so.
&quot;If you&#39;re a tobacco dealer and you&#39;re left with just this little loophole, the idea of promoting your product online is very tempting,&quot; explains Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in trademark reviews written by ostensibly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is this really the work of an ordinary citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he spared no effort and time and made a video, or is there an advertising company behind this?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says the industry is now more busy adapting to the new rules than advertising.
The tobacco industry has even gone to such lengths as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states are making claims under the World Trade Organization that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very insignificant.
A WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tania Plibersek, the government has been discussing with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada pioneered the mandatory posting of health warning photos.
Now this rule has been adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia defiantly disobey the innovations.
These pictures don&#39;t bother me.
I just don&#39;t pay attention.
&quot;You just grab a cigarette and put the pack in your pocket,&quot; explains Victor El Haig, who buys cigarettes with a picture of a mouth tumor on the pack.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack cigarette shop in Sydney&#39;s city centre, says the same packaging has made it difficult to sort items on the shelves.
&quot;It used to take me an hour to unload a new batch, but now it takes me four hours,&quot; he complains.
&quot;The government should have gone and completely banned cigarettes, then we would have said: what to do, okay, it&#39;s over, we close the store,&quot; he says, throwing his hands up.
Being bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
Thus, I had enough time to reflect on the nature of boredom.
I won&#39;t deceive you.
Half a day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and books, magazines, iPhones, and even duty-free shops will not help much.
Recently, however, more and more scientists and specialists in child development have spoken out in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations, it is not so bad for us and for our children to be bored.
This forces the brain to divert to interesting related topics, which may encourage creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some kind of screen, the benefits of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we need to aim for boredom?
Yes.
And at the same time no.
We&#39;ll get back to this.
I used to think, like many others, that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
It&#39;s not, says Peter Twoy, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011.
&quot;In fact, boredom has a very ancient history,&quot; he says.
Latin inscriptions about boredom dating back to the first century have been found on walls in Pompeii.
However, the question of how we understand boredom remains open.
The problem, says John D. Eastwood, an associate professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, is that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After reviewing research on the topic and asking a target group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came up with the following definition: boredom is when people &quot;want but cannot do what would bring them satisfaction.&quot;
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn&#39;t do something they would like to do.
When you&#39;re apathetic, you don&#39;t want to do anything.
The core of the boredom experience, he says, is &quot;disturbance of attention and associated deterioration in mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly.&quot;
Boredom can be described as very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible connection between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world around them and circumstances, while depressed people see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, when in fact we just find it difficult to focus on something.
In their study, &quot;An Unoccupied Mind: Defining Boredom in terms of attention,&quot; published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading a magazine.
Some participants also heard the loud sounds of an irrelevant TV program playing in the next room, others heard the same sounds at a low volume, so that they could hardly be heard, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without an extraneous sound track.
Those participants who listened to the TV at a low volume noted that they were bored, more often than others - they had difficulty concentrating, but they did not know the reason for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we&#39;re trying to focus on a difficult or exciting task, attention interruptions can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of this study.
On the other hand, when we&#39;re doing something uninteresting, &quot;for example, peering down a line of products on an assembly line looking for defects, distracting music can help stave off boredom.&quot;
It is believed, he continues, that when people start swaying in a chair or doodling on a piece of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that in fact, such actions simply help not to relax physically.
&quot;The study showed that children who are not prevented from fidgeting and fidgeting learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit still,&quot; says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all experience boredom: when a flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people show different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, researchers developed a &quot;boredomness scale&quot; to measure these individual characteristics.
Questions and statements are used to determine the rating on this scale, for example, &quot;A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous&quot; or &quot;I am interested in too many things, so there is not enough time for anything.&quot;
Using such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys are more likely to be bored than girls, says Steven Vodanovich, professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers generally often get bored.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he paged nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He got the following results: 32% of teenagers said they were bored at school and during homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
At the same time, only 3% of parents noted that they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what similar boredom data would be now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that &quot;the peak of boredom tends to peak during adolescence,&quot; largely because children and teens aren&#39;t allowed to fully decide what they want to do.
Back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because at its extreme, studies show it can push people into absurd and dangerous physical activities, risky gambling, or the abuse of certain substances in an attempt to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
&quot;This is how our brain tells us to do something else; that&#39;s boredom,&quot; says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this very brain does not always know what exactly is best to do.
If you get bored and channel that energy into playing the guitar or experimenting with food, you will make yourself feel better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will stop being bored, but he will not learn to deal with boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and busyness, says Professor Fenske.
&quot;And these self-regulatory skills come into play in a wide variety of situations,&quot; he says.
Your child is not only learning to occupy himself with something, he is also learning self-control in general.
I don&#39;t think boredom should be praised in any way.
However, it should not be considered something bad either.
Rather, one should learn to feel comfortable even outside the continuous flow of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees with this.
“The way we see it is that we need to get bored more often, when boredom is a very unpleasant, unquenchable desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
&quot;In today&#39;s world, we are used to constant over-stimulation of the senses,&quot; he says, &quot;and when silence comes, we are lost and do not know what to do.&quot;
It is not yet clear how the new marijuana legalization law will be applied in the state of Colorado
Anthony Orozco, a nineteen-year-old football player and community college student in southeastern Colorado, has been charged with a felony that will soon be perfectly legal throughout the state: possession of a small amount of marijuana and a pipe in which he smoked it.
Mr. Orosco says he was in Lamar with some friends one September and was driving across the prairie near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and possession of a drug paraphernalia—minor offenses that carry a $100 fine each—and a court date was set.
&quot;We are being treated like criminals,&quot; says Mr. Orozco.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that has been going on for weeks after the state of Colorado voted to legalize small-scale recreational marijuana use, hundreds of small court cases are decided less by law than by venue.
Marijuana misdemeanor charges are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in the state of Washington, which has taken a similar action.
Police stations have already stopped filing charges against people aged 21 and over for possession of small doses, which will become legal as soon as the law goes into effect in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have chosen to pursue existing marijuana cases and are still prosecuting possession of the drug.
At the same time, cities from suburban Denver to the highlands of the West are voting to keep new, state-licensed marijuana stores from entering their localities.
&quot;This is moving so fast that I don&#39;t even know what to expect next,&quot; says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Regulatory officials in Washington State are also scratching their heads in puzzlement.
They will have to form rules to determine how marijuana is licensed to grow, process, distribute and sell, all of which must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, for better or worse, is ahead of most other states in regulating the use of marijuana, first for medical purposes and now for recreation.
&quot;Colorado has a more orderly market, so they&#39;re a good example,&quot; said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Regulatory Council.
But right now, no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than put forward some proposals and hope it works.
&quot;We don&#39;t have a real precedent that we can look at,&quot; he says.
The Washington state bill, called I-502, will go into effect on December 6 and will plunge the state into a state of limbo for a full year, with no state licensing system yet and legal possession of marijuana.
And there are still tricky technical issues that need to be addressed during this period, such as how to balance the state&#39;s order for &quot;adequate access&quot; to licensed marijuana with a ban on its sale within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens. .
&quot;It will be especially difficult to locate licensed marijuana dealers in urban areas, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,&quot; said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the recently formed Center for Marijuana Legalization Research Group.
On November 21, Police Chief Oates of Aurora sent out an email to his subordinates that the city&#39;s Attorney&#39;s Office would no longer prosecute individuals over the age of 21 for possession of small amounts of marijuana, and that the police would stop incriminating people for these violations &quot;starting from now on&quot;.
Police Chief Oates said the police will enforce the city&#39;s rules governing medical marijuana growers and prosecute illegal drug dealers and distributors.
Weld County District Attorney in northern Colorado, Ken Buck, is taking a more rigorous approach to the matter.
After voting on the bill, he said that prosecutors would continue to prosecute marijuana possession, mainly to encourage marijuana users to seek treatment.
So far, 119 individuals have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are charged with other violations.
&quot;It is our institution&#39;s duty to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time they are committed,&quot; Mr. Buck said in a statement.
Reaction was mixed even in places like rural Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, are no longer prosecuting adults for possession of small amounts of drugs.
District Attorney Pete Houtzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in the already open marijuana possession cases.
&quot;I think it&#39;s our responsibility to enforce the law until it changes,&quot; he says.
While 55% of Colorado residents who voted supported the decision, getting recreational marijuana into the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the conflicting reactions of residents across the state exposed the ambiguity of the attitude of local authorities to the state&#39;s experiment with marijuana.
&quot;District attorneys have a cultural barrier to this,&quot; said Sean McAllister, a Denver marijuana attorney and local spokesman for the National Marijuana Law Reform Organization.
&quot;They&#39;ve been persecuting people for this for so long that they can&#39;t really come to terms with the fact that it&#39;s no longer a crime,&quot; he says.
Colorado and Washington - the first states to treat a small amount of marijuana the same way as alcohol - are destined to become a nationwide experimental field for testing the very idea of drug legalization.
Legalization advocates and state officials plan to expand the territory of the legalized trade, but at the same time they are cautiously waiting for instructions from the federal government, which still plans to consider the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Advocates of marijuana legalization are hoping that the Justice Department will give in on this issue.
Despite several high-profile arrests of drug dealers and patients for medical marijuana use, the federal government has largely approved medical marijuana sales in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Drug Enforcement Bureau agents are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana shops that are allowed under the new law, said Kevin A. Sabet, former counselor for drug control in the Obama administration.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local governments approved a moratorium on the opening of new marijuana stores that would not be able to open for less than a year anyway.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, put forward a six-month marijuana ban that is likely to be approved next week.
&quot;We don&#39;t want to be in a position where we give someone a license and then it causes serious problems at the federal level,&quot; says Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved questions.
Petronella Wyatt: I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I have always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and elder brother studied at Oxford and described it as the best educational institution in the world, a modern analogue of the ancient symposium, laying the two foundations of civilization - freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying history at Worcester College, Oxford University in the late eighties, I packed my bags and left, which resulted in the first real scandal of my life.
My father broke down and cried.
Friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn&#39;t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer E. Norman Wilson joked that I left because I had to drink from chipped cups.
It really wasn&#39;t all that funny.
I ran away.
Yes, I ran away because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I went to a private school.
I was hounded for only one reason, and in this glorious cradle of enlightenment, it looked like real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a famous adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the conservatives.
You ask, why remember this now?
According to recent reports, a new generation of center-right students are being targeted in the same way.
This institutionalized and ever-increasing hatred of conservative students at Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection for their rights as that given to disabled, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives from Corpus Christi College&#39;s student club in Cambridge say they are &quot;often actively sequestered, personally attacked and made to feel like unwanted guests&quot; because of their political views.
They want to add an additional representative to the college&#39;s equal rights committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation has only been exacerbated by the recently released BBC 2 documentary on student politics, Wonderland: The Young, the Smart and the Right, which portrayed conservatives as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, driving a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a silver-headed cane.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are being made &quot;scapegoats for tuition increases.&quot;
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of the Nottingham University Conservative Association, said in an interview with a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing left-leaning bias in the university environment.
People who don&#39;t even know us think we are impudent and violent children of rich parents with impunity.&quot;
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi College, where the protections were petitioned for, calls the atmosphere &quot;uncomfortable&quot;, while Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, says the attitude of the student club to bearers of right-of-centre views has deteriorated significantly.
&quot;This is a threat both to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and simply to the normal life of the members of the club,&quot; she says.
For the first few weeks at Oxford, I was not only in the minority, I was alone.
I entered there in September 1986, a timid and shy eighteen year old girl.
Oxford was feverish with hatred for the Conservative Party.
The year before, the university voted to strip former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to higher education budget cuts.
In such an atmosphere, even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable.
During the first days of the freshman week, when students get to know each other and the teachers, for the first time I had a sense of what lay ahead of me.
I did not yet know that the teachers not only turned a blind eye to the persecution of conservative students, but also took part in it with pleasure.
Political issues - a miners&#39; strike, privatization, and the government&#39;s refusal to impose sanctions on South Africa&#39;s apartheid government - crept through the wood-paneled auditorium walls.
In my first seminar, I needed to translate an eighteenth-century French text into English, and I was unprepared for what followed.
&quot;Miss Wyatt,&quot; said the teacher, the late Harry Pitt, &quot;please translate the first paragraph.&quot;
The text was given to me with difficulty, I stumbled.
Harry Pitt was a very bilious man with a cake-like face.
&quot;The Thatcherists don&#39;t learn French on principle, or do they just lack the brains?&quot; - he asked.
The other students giggled.
I had tears in my eyes.
&quot;I suggest you take some early French lessons in your spare time, unless you&#39;re very busy moving around,&quot; Pitt grumbled.
I returned to my room completely miserable.
That evening in college I sat at dinner alone; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student in the English department, who introduced himself as a member of the University Conservative Association.
&quot;I know who you are,&quot; he said amiably.
- Unfortunately, the situation is as follows:
anyone who is suspected of sympathizing with the conservatives will be mocked.
It&#39;s not easy for me myself, but in your case they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be more difficult for you.
Most Conservative freshmen pretend to be Labor.&quot;
Later, at the local pub, I cowardly tried to be hypocritical.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The ploy failed.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: &quot;You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You are contagious.&quot;
Other students took up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
&quot;How do conservatives have sex?&quot; One of them asked.
&quot;They hit each other, don&#39;t they?&quot;
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the decriminalization in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet like-minded people only under the cover of night?
Will I be forced to become a Labor Party and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years began to seem like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only professor in my college who was openly conservative was Norman Stone, professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being Thatcher&#39;s foreign policy adviser and one of her speechwriters.
He hardly showed up in college.
He despised him for his provinciality, pettiness and adherence to the Marxist-determinist view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
&quot;You won&#39;t be happy here,&quot; he told me.
I began to travel to Oxford from my parents&#39; house in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and open-minded friends in the capital.
I told my father that I hate Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn&#39;t believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were accepted there.
&quot;But it&#39;s the best university in the world,&quot; he said plaintively.
“They can’t do that, only not in the city of dormant spiers ...
Even my communist friends have always behaved impeccably.&quot;
His wet eyes clouded over.
&quot;Don&#39;t make hasty decisions.
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s just a joke.
You will break my heart if you drop out of university.&quot;
I was exhausted from the constant trips to London and my emotional defenses were weakening.
My friend, also a conservative, succumbed to the pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a seminar the following week, when another history professor quite seriously called me an &quot;enemy of the people,&quot; I decided to do the same.
In my heart, burning with shame, I admitted that &quot;I was brainwashed by my parents&quot; and called them &quot;old fools.&quot;
The break was short lived.
The final nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was my father&#39;s.
At the time, he wrote two columns every week for publications owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I did not come out, and five minutes later my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I packed my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You can call me a crybaby and a rag.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should be the object of such anger and intimidation in an educational institution.
It is all the more sad because it was Oxford, which not only produced fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university that values equality and free thought.
&quot;Valentino prefers elegance to glory&quot;
About the exhibition &quot;Valentino: Master of Sewing&quot;, which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitsa and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of &quot;Valentino: Master of Sewing&quot;, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his &quot;house&quot; over the past 50 years.
&quot;I love this palace,&quot; he says in his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of a story whose only character is &quot;il signore&quot; Garavani, but it could not have been written without his eminent clients.
Valentino has always felt fascinated by the rare and distant world of the nobility.
The first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, is replete with personal letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, including Marie-Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino displays these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from a modest tailor in the northern Italian city of Voghera to an idol of the international &quot;elite&quot;.
There is nothing wrong with being in love with the royal court.
&quot;At least they don&#39;t snuff out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some great pop stars do,&quot; says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemitsa.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a peerless host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
&quot;We all really enjoyed coming to his chalet in Gstaad,&quot; explains ex-wife &quot;Heini&quot; Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza representing Valentino
Argentine model Valeria Mazza recalls the charismatic fashion designer.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty invited were Sharon Stone and John F. Kennedy Jr.
Valentino&#39;s style manifested itself in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in its decoration, in food, in music.
“Valentino made each of the guests feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the fashion designer began in 1995 during Paris Fashion Week.
&quot;He never goes out of style because his sketches are true works of art,&quot; she concludes.
Pedigree Parade
Garavani&#39;s life is not a story of obsession, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with a good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a sixty-meter-long glamorous catwalk that offers a role reversal: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade down the catwalk, contemplating the &quot;viewers&quot; from dreams that sparkle with Valentino&#39;s masterpieces, such as the dress she chose Jacqueline Kennedy for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costume worn by Monica Vitti in The Night, or the wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience, models such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit from Norway, Rosario from Bulgaria or Sofia Habsburg shine from the models.
Nati Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like first love, &quot;impossible to forget.&quot;
I remember him well.
These were pants, a shirt, a &quot;waistcoat&quot; and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
&quot;It was a gift he gave me,&quot; says Nati Abascal, one of the designer&#39;s muses.
&quot;I prefer him to others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,&quot; adds the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors he uses: they have a lot of light and they &quot;fit&quot; with his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and trendsetter Patricia della Giovampaola d&#39;Arenberg also cannot forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I would have an age and a reason to wear one of his evening gowns...
The hour finally came in the late 1990s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear to a party at my cousin&#39;s castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress, with a ruffled skirt, a pleated &quot;bodice&quot; and a strapless neckline.
&quot;It was a dream come true,&quot; says the widow of Rodrigo d&#39;Arenberga.
&quot;Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is the timeless,&quot; explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d&#39;Arenberg keeps her holiday gowns from the fashion designer with &quot;the utmost care...because a dress is not just a dress, it is also a collection of memories that accompany it.&quot;
&quot;King&quot; of fashion
The grand finale of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller&#39;s wedding dress for her wedding to Pavlos of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 &quot;girls&quot; (as the fashion designer calls his seamstresses) to make this outfit from ivory silk with pearl inlay, twelve types of different laces and a train of four and a half meters.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the greatest authority of the trade press, the dress represents a milestone in high fashion at the end of the 20th century, &quot;the return of high society clients.&quot;
Besotted for many years by the &quot;lifestyle&quot; of the elite, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
Knight Grand Cross (the highest ranking insignia in Italy), Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honor, Garavani has collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
&quot;His refinement, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance always attracted my attention,&quot; recalls d&#39;Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d&#39;Orsay.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
&quot;He was impeccable, time does not exist for him.&quot;
If it&#39;s the princess speaking...
The hardest job in the world: miners from Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk life and limb by dragging 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano along steep rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, while others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of 400 miners who make a living mining sulfur in the Kawah Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where sulfur dioxide rising from the depths of the Earth solidifies on contact with air.
Having broken off huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, heels the baskets on his shoulders and carries them up the steep rocky road.
The summit of the volcano, which is 2,386 meters high, is only 250 meters, but it takes more than 40 minutes for exhausted loaders to climb at a snail&#39;s pace, struggling to maintain balance and carefully groping for the road so as not to stumble and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to a tourist from France who fell off the cliffs of Kawah Ijen a few years ago.
Miners from Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulfur they mine
Once at the top, they make their way between tourists who take pictures of them, as if they were monkeys from a circus and, wearily carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the scales, which the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been exploiting this volcano since 1960 and, better not to say, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical industries, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
&quot;Because carrying 70 kilograms is the norm, we earn about 46,000 rupees (€3.8) per walk,&quot; explains Anto, who usually does three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and feels overwhelmed at the end, but they allow him to save 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems like a meager amount for such an inhuman effort, it is three times what he would earn in the field.
&quot;Daily wages for miners are very high by local standards, where coffee pickers are paid Rs 15,000 (€1.2) per day and the average monthly salary is Rs 2 million (€167),&quot; explains a loader who used to work as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali. .
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so difficult, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: &quot;I married a girl from Bali, where there are only Hindus, and brought her to Java to convert to Islam.&quot;
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, constantly coughs, and has watery eyes due to toxic gases.
At 27, Anto spent three years risking his life in Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur was already beginning to take its toll despite wearing a mask and special goggles.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly, and has watery eyes due to the toxic gases the volcano releases.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
&quot;I&#39;ll work for another two years because I want to open a store or learn Spanish or French,&quot; he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, a waiter or a porter at a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden hut with other porters, he gets up every day at two in the morning, because sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns into blue and glitters in the darkness.
Defying the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, lighting his way with a small flashlight connected to his helmet, which he himself bought with his own money.
About 400 porters carry baskets of sulfur on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano.
Despite high profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to porters who work for their own account and with such hardships.
In fact, they don&#39;t even get a fraction of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photography fee that, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance ticket, the guards of this reserve charge from tourists who come to photograph the volcano and his mule people.
&quot;This job is for the cattle, not the people,&quot; says Badrusin, a 42-year-old stocky porter who has spent three decades on Kawah Ijen since leaving college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working &quot;as much as he can&quot; because he needs money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
Won&#39;t retire, die here because the volcano is my whole life
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in dense plumes of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that not one complains of their serious illnesses ... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with breathing, arthrosis, pain in the knees and ulcers on the shoulders, which were deformed under the weight of the baskets.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unaynik can now only lift 50 kilograms at his 53 years old.
Every day, he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks to a warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path through the thickets.
“I won’t retire, I’ll die here, because the volcano is my whole life,” Unaynik says, opening his mouth wide, which is missing several teeth.
Of his five children, the eldest, aged 30, also works as a sulfur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the hardest jobs in the world: what the human mules of Kawah Ijen do.
Singapore is looking for children to save the economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and housing and education prices for not having children.
&quot;Singapore&#39;s population needs to grow.&quot;
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, let&#39;s fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unbelievable that these lines are part of an advertisement for mints, but in spite of this - or perhaps because of this - this video became a hit on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like &quot;Let&#39;s put a bao (bun) in the oven&quot; to poke fun at Singapore&#39;s birth rate.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, hopes that through advertising they will be able to draw attention to this issue in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people fulfill &quot;their national duty&quot;.
This thing is exclusively for the web, so we needed to make it fun and funny.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world in reproducing our own kind, so we felt that this is the topic that we should touch on.
We knew the government was trying to do a lot, like launching pheromone perfumes or organizing speed dating parties.
Many of these ideas may have been creative but didn&#39;t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don&#39;t we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is rapping?
1.2 children
Who doesn&#39;t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to inspire citizens to have more children.
The State Parent and Couple Package provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and provides tax relief.
But all this is of low efficiency.
Singapore is a wealthy and high-tech city state in Southeast Asia, also known for its conservative leadership and strict social control.
Singapore&#39;s birth rate, according to its National Population Authority, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the replacement percentage - was in 1976.
So why don&#39;t Singaporeans have more children?
Tang Wei Ming, director of the National Population Administration&#39;s Couples and Families Policy Division, says the reason is &quot;improved education&quot; and &quot;a wider range of career opportunities.&quot;
&quot;This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities beyond getting married and starting a family,&quot; she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to an increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriage and childbearing, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies that aim to boost immigration to counter population declines are causing resentment among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where thinly disguised xenophobia thrives against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and unwilling to integrate.
Rising immigration is also seen as one of the reasons Singapore&#39;s ruling party had its worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem with quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected Consequences
While falling birth rates are having a known impact on a nation&#39;s economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare spending and immigration policy, the example of Singapore is also beginning to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so many small houses.
For example, it began to affect the real estate sector.
The City Development Guide has moved to control the number of small apartments, known as &quot;shoeboxes&quot;, that can be built in certain areas of the city.
This 46 square meter apartment is selling very well.
However, there is a perception that they can encourage bachelor living and de-incentivize developers who want to build large family homes.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of homebuilder EL Developers, says their &quot;shoeboxes&quot; sell much faster than larger ones.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments sell out in a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our cash receipts are increasing.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers who were previously stymied if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in a project.
Too overstressed
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards boosting the nation&#39;s birth rate, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the center&#39;s financial district, it doesn&#39;t seem like they will have much effect.
&quot;People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as well as education, and because of this, many people are putting it off,&quot; says the young manager.
Other people may have children.
&quot;But it&#39;s important for me to have my own money and time,&quot; says another young man in his 20s.
Men and women cite their careers, stress, and the cost of housing and education as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how hard the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, when it comes to childbearing, the Singaporeans have the last word.
Personal offline - personal online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Academy of the Spanish Language, we are talking about the property of private or &quot;a sphere of private life that they have the right to protect from any interference.&quot;
What is personal for a minor under 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and social media?
Does he understand the dangers he is exposed to when discussing situations online that he probably wouldn&#39;t share offline?
elPeriódico interviewed five youngsters between the ages of ten and 15 who are frequent netizens.
In four cases, they associated the term with &quot;something very mine&quot; in a personal way, and &quot;password and username&quot; when they applied it to social media.
&quot;My biggest secrets I wouldn&#39;t upload in a post,&quot; ten-year-old Jorge says as he tries to explain the meaning of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he&#39;s had accounts for two years.
&quot;These are very secret secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world,&quot; he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t share a photo that isn&#39;t mine or someone acting stupid,&quot; he says.
The boy realizes that it is wrong to post indecent photos of nudity, crime, or write offensive or hateful comments.
Jorge says he knows 35 of his FB friends and nine of his Twitter followers.
Most of them are relatives.
Mother is aware, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
&quot;I don&#39;t know if they answer me, I just upload them,&quot; he adds.
&quot;Social media is fun, I can talk to extended family or my friends in a quick way,&quot; he points out.
Without hesitation, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
Wouldn&#39;t consider someone who would recommend it to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and in the latter he admits that he does not know the 20 people added to his friends list.
&quot;It doesn&#39;t scare me because we have something in common, music for example,&quot; he points out.
According to the boy, no one rubbed his trust in him and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
&quot;If they press or demand me, I will simply remove them from my account,&quot; he admits.
José became an Ask follower after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
One friend of my friend was blackmailed on a social network.
He was threatened and extorted money.
&quot;He never found out who it was,&quot; he says.
The victim, according to José, did not delete the account.
&quot;Just turned on privacy.&quot;
He then explains the steps to set up an account in a secure manner.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of people he knew in awkward or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I don&#39;t like the person or if I feel like it.
&quot;Although I know it&#39;s cybermobbing,&quot; he confirms.
Key questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
&quot;The Internet started out as a means to find information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,&quot; she notes.
Porras points out that academic Mark Prensky, a Yale Master of Education and author of Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital natives are they, children and youth who were born in the era of technology.
&quot;We are digital immigrants who have to teach them while we are still learning,&quot; she says.
Explains that this topic is difficult, &quot;because we ask them to have a certain criterion for what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, at an age when the maturity is not enough for this.&quot;
&quot;Also that they be selective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences,&quot; she adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show what privacy is to children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
&quot;Telling them not to do it is useless,&quot; she adds.
Porras then lists some options: there are things you wouldn&#39;t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like it if they published a photo of you like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others post about you?
When you caption your party photos, do you ask other people&#39;s permission to tag them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should behave online the same way they do it offline.
The rules are the same.
&quot;Outside the Internet, a person behaves with respect, responsibility and other principles, it should be the same in social networks,&quot; she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, university lecturer, elementary education professor and education consultant, explains the need for family heads to conscientiously read social media policies.
By understanding each of the points, they have a good basis for talking with children about the prerequisites for opening an online account.
&quot;For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,&quot; he says.
According to Gaurdia, the key issue is to remind children of the lesson &quot;don&#39;t talk to strangers.&quot;
UNASUR Summit Ends Without Lima Declaration Released
The VI presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, announced earlier and theoretically signed by the seven mandatory participants.
Efe repeatedly tried to get access to the document signed at the 6th Ordinary Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, however, sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration indicated on the main page that it would be handed over after closing, but then confirmed that at some point it would be published on the web website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was laid out by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief press statements.
Journalists&#39; access to information about the Summit was limited all the time.
All that was broadcast during the day, in the press room, was a silent video of the Presidential Assembly with the message &quot;Closed meeting, no sound.&quot;
The little information that circulated among the reporters was relayed by the press secretaries of some of the UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which angered hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the &quot;final declaration&quot; of the summit, but this is Humala&#39;s statement, and not the official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III South American and Arab Summit (ASPA), and at that time, despite the fact that the press insistently demanded it, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not circulated.
On the official ASPA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to ensure that transmission systems were provided for all journalists, but they limited the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also ended with the joint decision of Chile and Peru to accept the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, gathered at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which is starting to hear statements from both sides in The Hague on Monday, as part of the accusation that Lima has brought against Santiago.
&quot;We will respect and implement a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently presenting to this international court,&quot; said Humala, next to his Chilean counterpart.
&quot;Chile was, is and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of differences, pacts and international tribunals,&quot; Piñera added, and greeted Humala with a handshake against the backdrop of the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they will submit to the International Court of Justice comes immediately after Colombia protested this week the Bogotá Pact, under which it accepted submission to the verdicts of this international court after the decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit took place in the absence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Christina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose UNASUR membership has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president, Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening discussions in the morning and closing the summit a little after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and directions of action were approved for 31 projects among South American countries, the amount of the proposed investment was $17 billion.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take &quot;important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding residency agreements.&quot;
He said actions are being taken to improve &quot;collaboration in the fight against citizen insecurity and organized transnational crime, action to increase the availability of medicines, low-cost Internet access in all corners of South America, and address the risks of natural disasters in a cumulative and effective manner.&quot;
As Europe is in crisis, &quot;(Latin America&#39;s) economic unification should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our manufacturing base and envision a better future for our cities,&quot; Humala added.
&quot;We have decided to privilege a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and forming new economic patterns,&quot; the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were related to Peru, and limited to transverse axes in its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched upon the political situation in Paraguay.
&quot;We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-join the Union of South American Nations,&quot; from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among neighbors, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before entering the regional meeting that he hoped to meet his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to negotiate in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute resulting from the verdict of the international court contested by Bogotá.
&quot;The day after tomorrow (Saturday) I will probably meet with President Daniel Ortega,&quot; Santos said.
&quot;We will review all these ways, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussion with Nicaragua,&quot; he stressed.
&quot;With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,&quot; Santos added.
Santos and Ortega will meet Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country&#39;s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Also within the framework of the summit, the bloc&#39;s defense ministers tentatively met to approve the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of protecting the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although participation of the last of the countries is suspended.
Peru has an interim presidency in the regional bloc.
&quot;South America should learn from Europe on citizenship integration&quot;: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which &quot;South America, in this case, yes, should learn from Europe.&quot;
Correa, who attended the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans &quot;killed each other in World War II&quot; and in other clashes, &quot;but now they are practically one fatherland.&quot;
He defended, in this context, the project of establishing South American citizenship, which is approved by the member countries of UNASUR.
&quot;We need to achieve free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already happening with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to take us back to the past,&quot; he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also showed himself to be a supporter of the renewal of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who give lectures never make any commitments, while we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
&quot;It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is located in Washington and funded by the United States,&quot; he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but respected his &quot;deep values of democracy and human rights.&quot;
He added that at one time &quot;there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that the process would not be followed.&quot;
He also criticized Swedish justice for requiring people to come to its territory for interrogation about an alleged sex crime, when &quot;the Swedish law itself considers it possible to carry it out through a video conference that could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London.&quot;
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of deterioration in Assange&#39;s physical and mental health.
&quot;I haven&#39;t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me that he had a slight lung problem, nothing serious,&quot; the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What is really there is the danger of deterioration in his physical and mental health due to confinement in a small space without the opportunity to exercise in the air.
&quot;It affects the health of any person,&quot; he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, through the provision of an immunity guarantee that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, and stressed that there had been talks in London about finding solution to the problem of imprisonment of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate on human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there were constant discussions.
&quot;The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judiciary, because Assange&#39;s lawyer, Baltasar Garzon, is leading a number of cases in various European instances,&quot; he mentioned.
And he expressed the opinion that &quot;if the UK provides a guarantee of immunity tomorrow, it will end.&quot;
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows it and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Senor Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, tomorrow this problem will be settled.
Correa took the opportunity to prove himself as a defender of press freedom and stressed that he does not tolerate &quot;mediocrity, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression.&quot;
&quot;The main enemies of press freedom are not corrupt villainous politicians, but bad journalists who support profit, blackmail and extortion,&quot; he said.
In this aspect, he was satisfied that neither these journalists, &quot;neither the bankers, nor the bourgeois hegemonic countries dominate Ecuador&quot;, and added that, being re-elected, &quot;he will deepen the revolution in order to continue development in the right direction.&quot;
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay&#39;s veto in UNASUR until at least the next election, arguing that the organization &quot;should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality&quot; because in reality &quot;it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy.&quot;
In addition, the Ecuadorian president considered &quot;completely justified&quot; the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to now negotiate with Nicaragua on maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of The Hague, which turned out to be in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, this decision is not being followed.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
We need to process them together in order to overcome them and continue to move forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the dispute on maritime boundaries, which is being conducted in the same court by Peru and Chile, and said that &quot;it is right for Latin America to apply to international instances if the two countries undertake to make a decision, no matter how difficult it may be&quot; .
Regarding the possibility of running as a candidate in Ecuador&#39;s forthcoming presidential election to run for a third consecutive term, he indicated that he was considering the opportunity &quot;with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult.&quot;
Correa assured that if he loses the elections in February 2013, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust situations as in Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
&quot;My political movement considered that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so this responsibility must be recognized,&quot; he said.
If I win, this would be my last term as president, and then we withdraw from public life.
If we lose, the same.
&quot;This is the solution,&quot; he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro who told me that he had gone for treatment that was already scheduled, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
&quot;This does not mean an aggravation of President Chavez&#39;s health,&quot; he explained.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are the result of late diagnosis
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that he had tested positive for AIDS.
“It was like I was stunned,” he recalls that difficult moment, despite all the doctor’s tact.
The young man hid this from his family.
Deciding to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts paid off - he has already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the &quot;oldest&quot; patients in the HIV department of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived in 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with a diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s, it would have been hard to believe - there were too few treatment options then, too little was known about the disease, too biased towards the sick.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Security did not want to say goodbye to him, &quot;because he had a cut.&quot;
In other words, in those days, having AIDS was a death sentence.
It is now possible to survive this syndrome and do so without compromising quality of life.
However, unaware of their illness, many people still come in when the virus has already taken its toll, &quot;depleted&quot; their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, &quot;the great achievement at the moment is that the survival of the patient who begins treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same,&quot; said the head of the HIV department. HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, citing that this information was confirmed in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectionist and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva explained that since 2008 scientists have come to the conclusion that AIDS is not a death sentence, but life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system present in patients at the start of diagnosis, with a better life expectancy of life in those who do not use drugs: up to 30 years with 200 CD4 counts, and up to 50 years when 500 CD4 counts are reported.
Simply put, the above means that someone who receives an HIV-positive diagnosis at age 25, according to these terms, &quot;maintaining control, will be able to live without problems until the age of 75,&quot; he explained.
To appreciate this progress, remember that the life expectancy of Mexicans today averages 76 years.
Although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying of AIDS has dropped from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the advent of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths had already been registered by May this year; however, it is claimed that there has been universal access to antiretrovirals since 2005.
Why are there still deaths?
- Personally, it seems to me that the problem is not in access to treatment.
This is how I imagine it, this is how things are in our hospital.
For at least the last 12 years, we have not had a shortage of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late, because they do not know about their infected condition, that is, in the advanced stages of the disease.
He cited devastating data: &quot;Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some kind of opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to diagnose at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection in on a massive scale, for all the people who ask for it.&quot;
Experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Jalisco (COESIDA), as well as patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who turned to a private laboratory for testing, prompted only by the fact that his friend did it and, despite his at a young age, he was already at the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi&#39;s sarcoma, a cancerous tumor that is one of the most common complications.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they&#39;re going to die and don&#39;t want to know anything.
&quot;Since I&#39;m going to die anyway, I&#39;d rather get drunk three times a week,&quot; they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, I do exercises, I take medicines.
To date, his parents only know that he survived cancer.
I live a normal life like anyone else.
&quot;I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and the other person,&quot; listed Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to move his statement to those who now, in the context of World AIDS Day, is experiencing fear.
Let them get tested if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, that&#39;s better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This message of his summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS this year 2012.
condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between health programs and the common citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has covered the HIV issue.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In the places devoted to this task, &quot;in fact, the distribution of condoms has increased, before we were given one or two, now we are given packets of a hundred, which is very good, but it turns out that there are those who now still do not have access to condom,&quot; he said.
Adolescents are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
&quot;Why do you need them?&quot; it is a popular question, with sniping and condemnation, from social workers, school counselors, pharmacists and health workers, that teenagers do not want to hear, the propagandist assured.
I propose to change this inefficient distribution; that condoms are not only behind the counters and that a hundred of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places frequented by young people.
This is not an encouragement for promiscuity.
It&#39;s not about paying for a beer and a motel, Gov. Emilio Gonzalez responded when asked if condoms could be handed out under his leadership.
&quot;It&#39;s not sexuality, it&#39;s best to make condoms available to those who are already sexually active,&quot; he said.
Key data in Jalisco
There were 13,435 total cases registered (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is ranked 4th nationally for new and cumulative AIDS cases and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are related to the sexual route, 6% through the blood and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV, as for one reported case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.
Given the ratification by a United States Court of Appeal of a decision that voids the Vitro Group&#39;s debt restructuring achieved through bankruptcy proceedings in Mexico, the scenario sets a fatal precedent for any national company with subsidiaries in a neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It seems that the pro-survival procedures that are allowed under Mexican law are not valid in the country of the stripes and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In practical terms, the approval of the June 15 ruling by Judge Harlene Hale in Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican firms exposed to the possibility of foreclosures across the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door for Mexico&#39;s leading glass maker to take legal action in the United States Supreme Court, citing three inconsistencies in evidence.
By way of introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the US Bankruptcy Code, the New Orleans-based Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit says the main proceeding concerns bankruptcy proceedings pending in Mexico.
The first point implies the annulment of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of transnational enterprises.
In fact, for this purpose, the UN Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, appointing the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Second, the verdict establishes that without the intercompany vote recognized in the critical mass of bankruptcy proceedings that the Vitro affiliates owed to the parent company, the majority needed to approve the restructuring would not have been reached.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme has been adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were guaranteed by the Federal Bankruptcy Institute.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of the affiliates, one way or another, Vitro&#39;s creditors who fought against him in the courts of the United States, namely the &quot;vulture&quot; funds like Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would be 45 percent to 37.
The Court of Appeal omits these data.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008, affected by the severe economic crisis that hit the United States, hitting the country.
So far, the firm of the Gonzalez Sada family will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenum, that is, five judges, since only three voted.
If unsuccessful, a motion for certification will be made, which will require a review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;), which described the process followed by Vitro under the Bankruptcy Law, signaling that it exempts itself from complying with agreements, signed by both countries to tie it to section 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has obeyed the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, that is, the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Cannon from two sides: they hit Vitro and hit the country.
Overall balance
With complaints put on the table by the Mexicana de Aviación unions against the former owner of the company, Gastón Azcarrague Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, put on the table for several months, the Aviator Pilots Union Association has already found a bottleneck.
The court, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal complaint against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
According to this, the supervisory authority systematically refused to report to the Attorney General of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the bank IXE trust fund F/589 on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
The resources would be used to buy shares in the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Azcarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surround Dragon Mart
Gathering at a forum at the University of the Caribbean over the weekend, a group of local and international environmentalists, scientists, businessmen and members of general civil society approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of China&#39;s Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a gigantic sales and distribution center for Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean for the products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeast zone to resist the monumental forces that leveled part of the protected areas and pose serious threats to the industry.
Death ACTA
Regarding the Senate&#39;s rejected demand by the government to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the English abbreviation ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property, the case has already been filed.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of considering it as violating freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long run
In an effort to pay off long-term debt without impacting short-term debt, home developer Homex is placing 500 million pesos worth of Exchange Certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical ones, with an offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competitive is born
Formed by information technology leaders NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, a consortium branded as Competival has just come into existence to target the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed 1.5 billion dollars.
Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes: &quot;Basketball was my life&quot;
Avid basketball traveler Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes has been involved with the sport for over 60 years and traveled the world through him.
Few people in Puerto Rico have as many basketball stories as Hector &quot;Hetin&quot; Reyes.
And yet, before a cerebral hemorrhage left him in a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes had been immersed in the sport for over 60 years, as a minor player, Major League Basketball player, commissioner and executive of the BSN with the Bayamón Cowboys, and President of the Basketball Federation. .
&quot;I have played many roles in basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was BSN President, National Team CEO and Federation President in the 90s,&quot; Reyes recalled during a Primera Hora visit to his home. in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
&quot;Basketball was my life.&quot;
Reyes is not exaggerating when he makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and memorabilia collected from his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamon in the heart
With the greatest emotion, he keeps those that remember his path through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he was 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
“Those were my best years and the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboy championships since 1967, either as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year Jerome Minsi made his BSN debut.
From then on, &quot;Cuco&quot; Ortiz, who was a great administrator, was in charge,&quot; Reyes said.
I remember that Gene Bartov, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: &quot;I have a very strong player for you, 6&#39;7&quot;.
&quot;Want?&quot;
And that was the start of Minsi, one of the best players that Puerto Rico had.
Bartov then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who received citizenship and became one of our top scorers.
I remember saying that if Minsi had brought the championship to Bayamón, Gauss would have helped win another one.
I enjoyed the championship of the Cowboys with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 I was already listed as the head of the federation.
By that time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and Minsi&#39;s achievements in the national team.
I remember the first time we beat the USA during the 1989 Olympic qualifiers in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Championships, where we got fourth place and it should have been bronze if it wasn&#39;t for the Canadian referee who made us replay the final game, Reyes said.
Is that team from the 1990 World Cup the best team you&#39;ve ever seen?
She&#39;s among the best, just like the one that beat the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the one from the Pan American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and defeated the US team, which was pretty similar to the one that won the bronze against us at the World Championships.
Not only did Minsi, Gauss, Ramón Rivas, Fico López and &#39;Piculina&#39; (Ortiz) play again on that team, but also the young (Javier) &#39;Tognito&#39; Colón and James Carter, the brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario &#39;Quixote&#39; Morales, who was unable to compete in &#39;90 due to a knee injury.
The team that may not have been the best in terms of personnel, but brought us the gold medal and great joy, was the 1995 Olympic Qualifier team in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role players like &#39;Canito&#39; Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hurruitner in place of players suspended for messing up the Mar del Plata Pan American Championship, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without any doubt, it was Pikulin Ortiz.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated this level the way Pikulin did.
And that&#39;s without taking into account his career in the various leagues he&#39;s played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican executive?
That&#39;s a very difficult question.
We had very good youngsters including Julio Toro, Flor Melendez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the young, I really like the work of Leo Arilla.
What do you consider your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s BSN had up to 17 teams per season.
What&#39;s left for you to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, such as regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, that the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it&#39;s redundant.
At least I can see the fruits of compulsory certification and a course for managers, officials and judges.
This gives me pleasure.
What are you doing right now?
Most of all I listen to music, watch music videos from my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman dies
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as &quot;JR&quot;, in the television series Dallas, in which he embodied a businessman without principles. , evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as predatory oil tycoon JR Ewing on the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as JR for the new season of Dallas, died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the Dallas production studio.
&quot;Larry is back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, once again playing the iconic role he loved most,&quot; his family said.
Larry&#39;s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and the sequel, was by Hagman&#39;s side when he died in a Dallas hospital, spokesman Geoffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented and I will miss him very much.
&quot;He had an original personality and lived life to the fullest,&quot; Gray confirmed in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in his liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before &quot;Dallas,&quot; Hagman rose to prominence on television for his role as a decent type in the light comedy &quot;I Dream of Jeannie,&quot; which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive genie, played by Barbara Eden, and begins living under the same roof with her.
He was also the lead character in two rarely seen comedies, The Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and Here We Go Again (ABC, 1973).
His film work has included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully obnoxious JR that catapulted Hagman to stardom.
A CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan &quot;Who shot JR?&quot;, conceived to create buzz around an emotional episode in which Hagman&#39;s character is almost killed, generated international discussion and millions of dollars risked in bookmakers.
It also helped bring the series to record-breaking audiences at the time.
When answered on the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it, making Dallas the second most watched entertainment program in history, behind the 1983 MASH finale, which drew 50 million viewers.
It was JR&#39;s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
JR got in her way and then threatened her that he would accuse her of prostitution if she didn&#39;t get out of town, but the others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as a greedy, corrupt man with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), to be put into treatment.
&quot;I know what should be on JR&#39;s tombstone,&quot; Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, &quot;Here lies honest citizen JR Ewing.&quot;
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, also a heroine of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone &quot;huge, both on and off the screen.&quot;
He is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of admirers around the world, and in the hearts of each of us who were lucky enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of &quot;Dallas&quot; aired a few months ago to great acclaim on TNT.
The recording of five episodes of the second season had already been completed and a sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman&#39;s departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in such classics as &quot;South Pacific&quot; and &quot;Peter Pan&quot;.
Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater scene in the early 1950s and then served in the FA Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, home to many celebrities.
In 2001, he titled his memoir &quot;Hello Darlin&#39;: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life&quot;.
&quot;I didn&#39;t include anything that I thought would hurt or affect anyone in any way,&quot; he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he became an advocate for organ donation and volunteered at a hospital to help patients who were afraid.
&quot;I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet with them when they go into surgery and after,&quot; he pointed out in 1996.
I&#39;m trying to offer some consolation, like &quot;don&#39;t be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;
He was also active in the anti-smoking campaign and participated in several campaigns.
A course that explores &quot;The End of the World&quot; begins
Each week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Sharma decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible lure: the end of the Mayan calendar&#39;s &quot;long countdown&quot; on December 21, which many people seized on as proof that the end of the world was coming. .
But Sharma had no idea what was in store for him in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, the financial crisis that some call &quot;long Armageddon&quot;, and the growing conflict that would drag Israel into the place where Christian end-time theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
&quot;I didn&#39;t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever,&quot; Sharma told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what is happening in the world at the present time, as if we had only 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember that bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he&#39;s not the only professor to offer courses on &quot;the end of the world&quot; this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Associate Professor Barry Wacker teaches a course on Media, Culture and the End of the World.
Each week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
&quot;We&#39;re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,&quot; he said, and the way in which hypothetical scenarios are proposed that cause certain human behaviors.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they relate to real-life examples.
&quot;I tried to tell students about what is possible, likely, plausible and impossible,&quot; Wacker said.
On Pennsylvania State University&#39;s main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to teach a course simply called &quot;The End of the World.&quot;
&quot;We&#39;re not adding &#39;2012&#39; so we can always read the course again if the world doesn&#39;t end,&quot; Restall said.
Despite the &quot;imminent destruction&quot;, students must study, prepare projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on Apocalypse Eve, leaving students with no choice but to work &quot;until the night the world is supposed to end,&quot; Restall said.
The courses proved to be quite popular.
&quot;Seats filled out in two hours,&quot; Restall said of his high GPA course, which had 35 students enrolled.
We received emails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there were still places.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
&quot;I love watching what people do to comfort themselves,&quot; said Brigid Robinson, a 23-year-old religion and sociology student from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers Camden.
And the apocalyptic way of thinking, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or lack thereof.
Will Vekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing student, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
&quot;I&#39;ve never heard of a course that teaches this,&quot; he remarked.
I like him.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone the professor - said they believed in a December 21 date for the end of the world.
&quot;Our first project was about Mayan prophecy, and in a way we discredited it,&quot; said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old senior at Temple University from West Chester.
The Maya never predicted the end of the world; it&#39;s just a key moment on the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic uneasiness in Western culture that goes back several centuries, where people react to changes around them by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
&quot;In other places, people don&#39;t think about it,&quot; he said.
Predominantly in the English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who is teaching courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered a question about whether he knew of any &quot;end of the world&quot; course there.
&quot;Philippines do not take part in the end of the world,&quot; he wrote, alluding to the order of a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that many days of the final judgment had been spoken of for a long time, and said that if nothing happened on December 21st, &quot;people would immediately start thinking about the next date&quot; or philosophizing that December 21st was the start of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are nonchalant about this date.
Some said they were going to go to &quot;doomsday&quot; parties.
&quot;Maybe I&#39;ll call some of my friends to laugh together,&quot; commented Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
