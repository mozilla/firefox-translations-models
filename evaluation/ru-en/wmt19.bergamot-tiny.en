By the way, the release of penicillin from mold mushrooms was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few years earlier, he, being a cold, sowed mucus from his own nose to a petri dish (this is such a glass lid in which experiments with bacteria are conducted) and a few days later found that the bacteria that were there were destroyed.
Almost also accidentally, he found penicillin.
The name Fleming was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding personalities in the history of mankind.
His discovery, according to many scientists, changed the course of history.
With the help of penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the oldest diseases, previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, the Paris newspapers wrote: "For the defeat of fascism and the liberation of France, he did more than dozens of divisions."
According to experts, Fleming’s discovery of the world’s first antibiotic saved the lives of more than 200 million inhabitants of the world.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in the famous St. Paul's Cathedral in London.
Where, by the way, our and my wife paid attention to this, a vocabulary Russian-speaking guide.
And a few years later, the statue of Alexander Fleming in full growth we had to observe in the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spain.
There, next to the main arena for the critrade of Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to a man whose efforts were saved, in their opinion, the lives of hundreds of outstanding masters of bullfighting.
By the way, this, in my opinion, is a very interesting porcelain work I found there, in Madrid, but at other times and not at all about this.

Trump noted that the team of Barack Obama so launched relations with the DPRK that could not even reach the country's leadership - there simply did not pick up the phone.
Then the United States and the DPRK were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader writes “beautiful letters” to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work, too, “was cruel” to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved so much that the leaders “came in love with each other.”
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.

All this is the merit of the work of his administration, the American president is sure.

Nice called for the displacement of the “Moscow language with Ukrainian product”

She offers this to the Ukrainian product - "a cultural wave, cultural onslaught."

According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is even already there and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will “get a recovery” from this “Moscow language”, she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, according to her, earlier on television and radio Russian speech was widely used, but in the public space it is practically not left.
At the same time, according to Nytsoy, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only “an extension of borders for the Ukrainian speech at the legislative level.”
Earlier, Nitsoy shared the experience of maintaining the “Ukrainian-language regime” in the children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court of the network of bookstores Watsons, the cashier of one of whom communicated with her in Russian.
Not having achieved his, Nitsy threw the change at the girl.
The use of Russian words by Ukrainians, she calls “language schizophrenia”, urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing names.
Recently, Nitsoy said that the name “Rus” was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Muscovy.
The writer’s anger could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: having come there and heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, slamming the door.

“Such a difficult game turned out, a serious men’s conversation was held during the break, and it brought its fruits: they scored two goals and did not miss.
“You missed a few matches because of the damage that I got at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?”
"If you have passed 90 minutes, then everything is fine!
Actually, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of power so that nothing happens.
And so, doctors and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Gashnev brought me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
"What do you say about the atmosphere on the team?"
“It’s no secret that it’s easier to recover and the mood in the team is good.
Now we had a white stripe, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same vein and delight the fans.”
"Missing the game during the time I didn't go out on the pitch?"
“There is such a little bored, because indeed, the unpleasant situation has come out.
But again, thanks to the physiotherapist and doctors who put on their feet.
The most important thing is that we won and pleased the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

Serbian president wants to ask Putin for support
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will discuss with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin the situation with Kosovo and ask for his support during a meeting in Moscow.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow.
During the meeting, he plans to discuss with his colleague from the Russian Federation the current situation with Kosovo.
In addition, Vucic intends to ask Putin for support.
The corresponding statement was made by the Serbian leader during a press conference, the local newspaper “Evening News” reports.
According to the source, the head of Serbia said that, speaking about the need for support from the Russian side, he does not mean military support following the example of Syria.
Aleksandr Vucic said that he did not want to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes could occur on the territory of the state.
The President of the country promised to make every effort to preserve peace, reports the publication.
We add that according to the information of the Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes “Tape.ru”.
A day earlier it became known that the Serbian president brought the army of the state in full combat readiness because of the situation with Kosovo.
We are talking about the events of last Friday, when several dozen special forces of Kosovo entered the territory that is adjacent to the lake supplying water to the gas plant "Gazivode".
It is specified that this HPP is located in the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time refers to the Serbian energy system.

Kosachev: At the 73-th session of the UN General Assembly, the topic of Russia in a negative way was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73-th session of the UN General Assembly to be successful for Russia and does not exclude that it will be able to become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in solving global problems.
“The uniqueness of the current 73-th session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric, to which we are almost accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now an order of magnitude more muted,” the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
He explained that in previous years, Russia was sometimes “marked as one of the three main threats to humanity, along with Ebola, along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this series, in any case, in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which in this regard was expressed unanimously.”
At the 73-th session, Kosachev stressed, "Russia's topic in a negative way was practically absent."
“If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of foreign Affairs of Germany, I now do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was absolutely not exactly,” the politician said, noting that Russia “was no longer a certain wall that is being trained by the strikes with a tennis ball.”
The head of the profile committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, “will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this trend may be fully manifested in a year, in two, three.”
“I do not rule out that the current session in a sense can be a turning point,” Kosachev admitted, explaining that “too many examples of how Russia manages to move forward in international affairs with the connection.”
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
“Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time,” the parliamentarian added.
This is due to the fact that he believes that there is an “adequate, sound perception of Russia as not just possible – an integral participant in solving global problems of our time.”
“I don’t want to make a mistake, but I have a feeling that we are going through a point somewhere beyond where the movement will no longer be reversed, it will be moving forward,” he added.
Another “interesting and important feeling” in this context, Kosachev called “a request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop.”
“I was at a lot of meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, no one was interested, now the situation is different,” the chairman of the Soviet Federation committee said.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that “the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas about how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problems of terrorism, the problems of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problems of migration.”
"And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense "the current session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

AfD became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant “Alternative for Germany” breaks another record of popularity, and Angela Merkel’s ratings are falling.
Apparently, the people of Germany began to seriously become tired of the immigration policy of Angela Merkel, thanks to which the country became a coveted goal for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
The most obvious are the recent opinion polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party “Alternative for Germany” is becoming increasingly popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, the AfD broke another record, rising to the second line in the ranking of folk sympathies.
Right-wing conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap in one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it is impossible not to note the fact that the AfD created in 2013 from a small group of Eurosceptic economists has managed to turn into a serious political force.
Leadership in the overall standings continues to hold the ruling block of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, support for the Angela Merkel bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, which heads the German government for a fourth consecutive term, is also decreasing.
Today, 48 percent of Germans are in support of Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
We add that the social democrats are “green” (15%), the left (11%) and the liberals (10%).
Evolution of "Alternative"
The Alternative for Germany party was established in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included immigrants from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially stood in opposition to the government, but at first dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed the “sponsorship” of the weak EU economies by Germany, did not rule out the possibility of returning to the German mark and the full withdrawal of the country from the European Union.
Amid deepening the immigration crisis, the AfD political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed a full-fledged party that occupied the niche of Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, having received 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of the Alternative for Germany will have seats in the European Parliament.
Published a video with a journalist who called Ukrainian citizens “nation of dutches”

As Drozdov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
“We have not been instilled in the culture of reading and accepting texts since childhood,” the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting Nezalezhnaya began to fight literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as much as 201 editions.

Canadians created a car in case of an apocalypse - magazine Behind the wheel
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it is already accepting applications for its new armored car.
Armored apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
On the topic of the apocalypse, money is made not only by manufacturers of video games, film studios and book publishers.
Now a new niche is being mastered by car companies.
So, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions introduced its armored apocalypse of Senator APC.
In their free time from fantasies, the engineers of this company create armored vehicles for the police.
Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are without much comfort, but are completely accommodated in a wet armor capsule.
This bunker, otherwise the design can not be called, since the level of its booking corresponds to the B7 standard, is set on the chassis of a powerful pickup Ford Super Duty.
Its bottom, also armored, is capable of protecting the capsule from pomegranate bombings and anti-personnel mines.
Salon armored apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
So that passengers do not even harm the blast wave from a projectile that exploded next to the car, the cabin of the car is equipped with special shock-imposing chairs.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For safe view, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a circular camera system with a night vision function, as well as an observation tower on the roof.
There is no weapon in the car.
Front part of the armored armored salon of the Roshel Senator APC

Named the life of the universe
The universe will last about 140 billion years, which is ten times the age of the observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
The study of the international team of scientists is posted to the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and is sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, according to the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
To such conclusions, experts came, observing with the help of the HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope for about ten million galaxies.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which accounts for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observed world, scientists, working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the expansion rate of the Universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
In a press release of the Subaru Observatory, it is noted that observations allowed to obtain a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the Universe, and the data of the European Space Telescope Planck specified the restrictions imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments for the fact that the observed world will cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Gap.
Failed another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum
The opportunity to find out the opinion of the people about the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow on Saturday held a meeting of the federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups who registered different wording of questions (the Central Election Commission registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a petition for registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians a question: "You are for the fact that the pension provision established by the legislation on pensions as of July 1, 2018. The age at which Russian citizens are entitled to an old-age pension has not increased?”
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and most legally capacious.
Most of the participants of the meeting were supporters of a member of “Fair Russia” Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communist party (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that the invitations were sent to all initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (its wording was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who friend is, and who the enemy is."

In the match "Loko" - "Akhmat" Turbine's mistakes fell, as from the horn of abundance
Former judge of the all-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Evgeny Turbina in the match of the 9-th round of the championship of Russia “Locomotive” – “Akhmat” and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the refereeing of Evgeny Turbine in the match "Locomotive" - "Akhmat"?
- I believe that this arbiter confirmed his unsuitability for the refereeing of the matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round of Spartak - "Dynamo", nor the Turbin himself, nor the leaders of the DSI did not make serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not hesitate to affect the ninth round: errors in his actions, private skippings of rough techniques fell like an abundance of horns.
For example, at 50 minutes, the railwayman Eder falls with the help of his hands in his penalty area, the defender of “Ahmad” Rodolfo.
From the gate is eight meters, but the Turbine does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode with the participation of Idov, who was at the 82 th minute, when it seemed that the ball hit his hand?
- I believe that there was a deliberate game by the hand of a defender in his penalty area.
The turbine was near the moment, sees this episode well and his first assistant on the right.
This moment was supposed to be seen by the reserve judge Sergei Karasev.
However, all three of them were hestimated and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match is distorted, and sports justice was violated.
This was the case when refereeing by concepts replaced and buried the sports spirit of the game.
At 52 minutes, Turbin did not dare to remove the defender of the guests Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight against Krykhovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, he demonstratively applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Should I have to show the second mustard?
- At this point, the Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite on the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing that some teams are put penalties for such violations as in the episode with Idov, and some not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
He was not given.
So, the arbiter does not give a second penalty to the opposite goal.
This is the principle that is used.
And the second point of double standards is that the judge is watching who plays.
Here played on Saturday "Locomotive" and "Akhmat" has serious claims to the work of Turbine, because the team was infringed.
Matt Damon played accused of raping Judge Kavanaugh at the start of SNL
American actor Matt Damon played the candidate in the U.S. Supreme Court Bretta Kavano, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on rape charges.
The candidate in the US Supreme Court previously attracted attention with his emotionality and detailing his stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly admitted his love for beer, but said that he never got drunk until unconscious.
In addition, in an attempt to acquittal on rape charges, Kavano said that in those years he was a virgin.
Damon also won these moments.
All I did was that I drank a lot and didn't think about sex at all.
I was the proudest, the most drunk virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone knows it,” said the judge in Matt Damon.
Previously, Kavanaugh was elected the supreme judge of the United States.
Barbra Streisand found in his cloned dogs strangeness in behavior
American singer Barbra Streisand said that the clones of her deceased dog behave quite differently than the original pet.
"They don't look alike.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul,” said the 76-year-old singer.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat-de-tulear dog named Samantha, which had to be lured due to health problems.

Specialists are engaged in the cloning of a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States thought about the naval blockade of Russia because of the supply of oil and gas
In the United States, Russia may launch a naval blockade to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The US authorities have so zealously taken to fight for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main suppliers of energy.
About the possibility of a naval blockade on the eve said the head of the Ministry of internal Affairs of the United States Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior performs not police, but civil functions, including implementing a policy in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement came out quite in the competence of the department headed by him, although it was not devoid of political color.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the U.S. Navy controls sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
From the words of Zinke, it followed that the need may be associated with Washington’s desire to prevent Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinkke recalled that Russia still receives the lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the global oil and gas market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East, as well as in Eastern Europe, the main motive for the activation of Moscow in this region, Zinkke is sure.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to oust Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure along this path, Zinke said.

Expensive violin was put on a pawnshop for a pittance
When in the LBC Boutique and Loan-based pawnshop in Somerville, the man brought the violin, the pawnshop worker who looked old and unpresentable old and unpresentable offered only $ 50.
But the experienced store manager, Dylan McDermitt, suspected that this was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from an expert.
Then it turned out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin master Ferdinando Galliano and is estimated at 250 thousand. dollars.
Only the bows to the violin are estimated at 16-18 thousand. dollars.
The investigation revealed that the violin was recently stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the tool was returned to the rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the violin got to the man who handed it over to the pawnshop, but he does not have any previous clashes with the law.
The manager says that now all those who bring a flounder violin to play her will now ask to play it to make sure that she really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL, we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: Spartak will take at its stadium in Tushina Rostov under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a person, as you know, is not at all alien "people's team".

The red and white now has a difficult streak: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, the team of Massimo Carrera suddenly flew into Rapida, and recently lost at home to Akhmat.
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak with a minimum score and not without difficulty beat in the Black Sea Contribution, and it is too early to talk about whether the most popular club in Russia has come close to the exit from the crisis.
"Rostov" three matches in a row could not win, but he did not know defeats for five matches.
Let's see if Karpin will be able to extend the win-win series with such a fundamental match for himself.

The translator compared the mentality of the Russians and the Germans

On the International Day of the Translator, September 30, said professional synchronizer translator Barbel Sachs.
She has been engaged in translations from Russian and English for more than 30 years.
“The Germans like to quietly plan events, and the Russians, as they say in the proverb, “clearly harness, but quickly go.”
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of an interpreter, this does not play a significant role, ”the specialist said in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, to understand that two countries can not do without each other, “it is enough to know history.”
And in the future, Saxe noted, there is no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.

According to her, for Berlin, the project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is especially important for Moscow, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

"This is an ugly nepotism"
Viewers are outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show “Voice”
The audience of the show "Voice 60+" accuses the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen manipulation."
When in blind auditions, he learned from the first notes the voice of his father Nikolai Agutin, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and would not turn to the performer.
But the skény feelings took over, and he chose a relative in his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor of bias in the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the father of the star absolutely unjustifiedly took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience of the show, resented the nepotism of ugly and frank dragging our close relatives to the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin would have enough strength and conscience not to carry my father to the end of it at first place, ”sayed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program “Man from the TV”.
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leonid Agutin “leaked” the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the audience still want to see in the show his father.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case, the audience wants an objective assessment and see in the final of really talented performers, and now Agutin discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of the "Voice" from the team of Agutin - they were doomed."
“Last time, Agutin showed how much he loves daddy, and today he had to show himself as a professional.”
“The contest has lost its meaning.”
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project his dad who does not sing whisper, how can you name a mentor after that?",
"I like Dad sings, organize a concert in the Kremlin for his money and see how many people come to this concert."
This is the show "Voice", not the show "Cool Relatives".
"It was unprofessional on the part of Agutin."
“Then you need to offer my own show to the Pope, not the show that is done for money 1 channel.”
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don’t understand why a voiceless dad should make me more understanding than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre drained, and Agutin’s father was brought to the final?
And then we all complain that on stage and from the screens the same faces for decades!
“Because you don’t get through the nepotism!”
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!

I had a good start, and in the second corner I was between the two cars that immediately clamped me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, moment, immediately.
He was in a very bad position.
Stuck in traffic.
I was hoping that after the rest of the rest set in the pit stop, we would get into the “clean air”, and the pace will return, but there was no rubber.
Plus, he struggled with his partner, he was also in contact.
I know he was a bit wrong.

Carrera’s actions were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to such things is non-sense stupidity.
I totally disagree with what Carrera is doing.
This only deepens the discord in the team.
First of all, these are poems, read and perceive them as you like.
I wouldn't have reacted to this in Carrera.
Everyone has their own opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be proud.
If Glushakov and Yeshenko likes, this does not mean that they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks flexibility of perceiving the situation.
And it does not serve a normal climate in the team.
Today, Spartak has no game, so this situation was not required to be inflated at all.
Maybe it was worth laughing at it together.
Spartak are not in order in different lines, there is unplayed after the introduction of young people.
Relations within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match, ”Tarpishchev is sure.
The game of the two teams will be held on September 30 and will begin at 19.00 Moscow time.

Pierces of Sirius discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
Pupils of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, visited a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The speech of the researchers took place within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary "Codes of Kurchatov", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as the driving force for the development of civilization.
The lecture of the scientist was published on the website of "Sirius".
Students have learned that modern technology needs a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to develop such volumes.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, which young scientists are working on today.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of natural technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arises when creating such technologies.
“The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal good.
This is an explosive growth of medical technologies, it is an improvement in the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually a technological reproduction of wildlife systems.
There is a flip side - purposeful interference in human life.
There are always risks.
There was a car - people began to die under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I am creating a medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction, ”the scientist quotes REN TV.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
Speakers were the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-Nature-like technologies of the Kurchatov Institute SRC Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.

Kemerovo residents outraged the flock of rams in the cemetery
On September 30, on the famous Kemerovo page in the social network, a message appeared from an eyewitness that one of the local cemeteries crave freely walked animals.
The animals walked a considerable herd between the fences and plucked grass.
Commentators expressed different opinions: one of the local residents noted that in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery there is no harm, and their appetite can even help clean up the territory from weeds and grass, but some of the residents of the city's animal behavior did not like:
“These are graves, not pasture.
There's nothing to do the rams there.
About rams, of course, you can not say that they blaspheme, but still not it is. (the style is preserved) - said in his message indignant Kemerovo.
One way or another, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will be taken soon.
To press and dominate - what is right?
There is no word to put pressure.
That's right, dominate.
The word "pressen" in the meaning of "grave, exert influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "proach".
We use this word, believing it comes from the word “pressure.”
But the “pressure” and “prolongance” is etymologically not only not close, but even in a sense the opposite.
Make sure of it yourself.
To doom (the church-book, outdated) means "quite, fully, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy."
Pleasure, pleasure is related to words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to have self-satisfactory value" - "to prolong yourself."
Old Slavic "addle" is related to the words "to command" and "will".
Pressure, suppression is completely different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaid - "press."
A similar phonetic look of the words “pressure” and “prolonged”, as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contaminating.
So we have this very “d[a]sitivity”, which is used in writing through “a”, which, in a good way, is wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the emergence and development of these words.
So, that's right to do it.
But this word is outdated, in its correct meaning no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people have a negative impact on you from above, use the word “pressure”.
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that it's the office.

with the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was told in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria, the former commander-in-chief of the VKS, the head of the Federation Council Committee on defense and security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of weapons from the air: the Aerospace Forces carried out and continue to strike all strikes exactly at the terrorist targets.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department for External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
“It’s like a Jewish thing to pour a yellow pointed star at a Jew, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created,” the metropolitan said on the Rossiya-24 TV channel.
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of the law”, the cleric believes.
“This is the Ukrainian Church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).

Viceroy of Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The governor of the Holy Assumption of the Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, made a call to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his address to the faithful of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturday on the website of the monastery.
At different times of history, our predecessors and native Christians in faith and spirit had to confess their faith and defend their shrines.
Given the situation that has developed, and according to the information that we have, and for the threats of reprisals, which is spreading, it is clear that we will have to survive something,” the metropolitan said.
He asked for support - prayer, moral.
Also, the governor of the Lavra stressed that, probably, “you will need your physical presence.”
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to reprisal, and therefore we will protect our shrine."
Who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and world shrine, should be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The metropolitan urged not to follow the lead of those who mislead believers.
The UOC has a canonical status defined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990 from the Mother of the Church.
And now someone wants to make an addiction to the news patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us by the Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,” the governor of the Lavra said.
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC canonically is independent and fully independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, the Tomos has our church already.
What kind of Tomos do we need?” - said Metropolitan Vladimir of Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other denominations have the Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
Believers to some extent understood and decided which temple to them to go to.
However, someone wants to sow enmity and discord again.
Some are envious that the domes shine on the temples that they want to destroy,” the priest stressed.
Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and a monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on top of the Pochaev Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical information about it dates back to the beginning of the XIII century.

If we continue to play as well, the victories will come
The head coach of the Moscow "Dynamo" Vladimir Vorobyov - about the defeat from "Motorist" (0:1) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
"There was a good game, interesting, although it went to the goal," Vorobyov said on the official website of Avtomobilist.
“They tried to play very easily.
I really liked the first period.
Didn't use some good moments.
In the second period, the opponent squeezed us a little, we survived.
But the removal of us was a little "feeded".
The guys played great, performed a coaching setup.
I think if we continue to play the right way, they will come victories.
Not scored, with zero goals, games are not won, but the content of the game itself was correct.
Luck will come if we continue to play in that direction.”
"In your opinion, "Automobilist" added compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“Then the foreign language didn’t play.
In the pre-season, the teams solved other problems, many young guys played.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
"Automobilist" is a good good team.
According to the standings, it is clear, the team plays correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena, and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
Lots of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
They knew that the team was going undefeated, they wanted to turn it on, but it didn’t work out.”

US is aiming the growth of opiate production in Afghanistan
The sharp aggravation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 talked a lot about in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against the state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
This year was a record in the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans were killed," Patrushev said.
The troubles of Afghanistan did not begin yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 terrorist group, al-Qaeda (banned in Russia) was declared the main enemy of the United States.
Less than a month later, America and NATO allies began there’s military operation “Indestructible Freedom.”
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops and now on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more illusive than in then.
U.S. troops are driven behind the fences of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they pay off the militants for money - if only they are not touched.
The Afghan government controls a smaller part of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% - from the Taliban movement (banned in Russia).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they grow there quickly.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia, exactly what they did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be fine with that.
As satisfied with the fact that over the 17 years of the American presence, the production of drugs (ophis) in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
The colossal growth of areas sown with opium poppy and multibillion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change in the name of the country.
The agreement on the renaming of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as the outcome of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the Greek province of the same name and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, political scientist: “Through this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia is entitled to a better future, hope for social change.
Greece will secure the right to its past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises cannot make absolutely everyone happy.”
For the renaming of the country are the ruling Social Democrats, headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Against - the conservative opposition and the President of the country George Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetina Chilimanov, Macedonia makes no sense to join the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government, headed by Zaev, is imposed from outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not like Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.
Fai Dulgere, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faces the biggest challenge in its history.
The country was at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia will make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole.
