Germany first in Europe introduces ‘uncertain sex’ when registering children
Germany will become the first country in Europe to be allowed to indicate “uncertain” when registering children born with hermaphrodite, instead of male or female.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the column "floor" in the birth certificate for time unfilled.
Instead of "F" (female sex) or "M" (male sex), parents can temporarily write "X" (uncertain).
This decision is aimed at not pushing parents to haste with the operation to “clarify” the sex.
According to statistics, one in 2 thousand newborns in the world is born hermaphrodite.
Anger because of the verdict of the organizers of the terrorist attack in Bali
Survivors and relatives of 202 dead in the Bali bomb in 2002 reacted angrily to the verdict handed down to the last of the conspirators, who had been brought to justice, and stated that Umar Patek should be shot.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced yesterday to 20 years in prison for his role in creating explosive devices used during the terrorist attack.
He can be released within 15 years if he receives parole.
The 45-year-old defendant was found guilty of mass killings in a two nightclubs in a popular tourist area of Kuta, in which 202 people were killed, including 88 Australians, and dozens more were injured.
He was also found guilty of a number of other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of church explosions across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors demanded a life sentence, although they could insist that a person nicknamed a “underminer” for his reputation as a master of explosive devices should be sentenced to death.
This decision exacerbated the painful memories of her mother from Perth June Cortin, who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in a terrorist attack carried out by Patek and his accomplices almost a decade ago.
Barely restraining tears, she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
“I really think he should follow in the footsteps of other guys.
He must appear before the shooting team, Ms. Cortin said.
“I have to live every day knowing that I will no longer have grandchildren and I won’t see my daughters.”
The Sari Club was destroyed when a massive explosive device was detonated into a parked van in front of the outside immediately after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where a suicide bomber blew up a backpack with explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
After this terrorist attack, he fell into a coma for a month and “did” three times, being connected to the life support system.
Mr. Hughes said that Patec should share the fate of three other members of the Jemaa Islamiya terrorist cell, responsible for the massacre, Amrosi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra, who were executed four years ago.
Indeed, this guy deserves the death penalty the most.
Save his life, well, there is no reason to save his life.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and hurting hundreds is not so much.
Patec is the last of the participants in the terrorist attack in Bali, who appeared before the court.
He hid for almost a decade but was eventually detained in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. troops killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent showed that intelligence evidenced that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in an attempt to re-establish links between Southeast Asian and Al-Qaida terrorist groups.
“He didn’t give up,” Ms. Cortin said.
Until recently, he did not regret how much grief he caused other people.
The verdict was handed down on the eve of the 10 th anniversary of the terrorist attack, which will be celebrated later this year in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of tears this year,” says Ms. Cortin.
Pattec can still appeal his sentence.
Medvedev expects that the SSJ-100 aircraft will be delivered to Europe
Russia expects that after consolidating the Superjet 100 aircraft in the markets of Latin America and Asia will be supplied to Europe.
"We expect that in total we will receive such agreements for more than 170 copies of aircraft of this type," Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said at a press conference with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told in a press conference.
The head of the Russian government noted that serious cooperation has been established with French colleagues, since this is a joint project.
Today we discussed some of the financial issues that are related to insurance, but we hope that after this aircraft strengthens in Latin America and the Asia-Pacific markets, it will also be supplied to our partners in Europe.
“I hope that it will someday be delivered to France,” the Russian prime minister said.
SSJ-100 - aircraft built by "Sukhoi Civil Aircraft" in partnership with Alenia Aermacchi.
The liner is developed on the basis of modern technologies and offers high standards of quality and comfort in the segment for 100 passenger seats.
Chicago goalkeeper Nikolai Khabibulin stressed: he understands that he should play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work hard in training.
In the last two meetings of the Hawks, Khabibulin first missed six goals from Tampa Bay, and then four from Ottawa, and in the second game he was replaced after the fourth missed puck.
We have to play well, and in the last two games I did not succeed, - quotes CINC Chicago words Khabibulin.
- I need to find confidence in training, probably it is worth approaching them as a game, and try to achieve the best result.
You have to learn your past games and work on the flaws that were.
There are a few small components that I need to improve, but in training I feel quite decent.
But for some reason after a few heads, everything turns into some kind of snowball.
Maybe I need to relax a little.
Goalkeepers - I don't think I'm the only one - always try to play the perfect game.
If I miss four, five, six, I'm not thrilled.
It doesn’t matter what happens in front of my gate.
I'm still working on myself to miss so many goals.
It’s great that my teammates support, but in principle everything is simple: I have to play better.
Two games are not all season, but I wanted to spend a lot better.
But it happened what happened.
I have to put it aside.
I’m just going to try to play the next match better.
Power engineers of Dnipropetrovsk began a unique program to save... Nestings
In the old days, to harass the storks to the court, the villagers on a high pole installed a wheel from a cart, and the heavy nest was well kept on it.
Such special supports have not been put for a long time, so storks have chosen the pillars of power lines - intertwined branches rely on wires, so that the aist house is reliable.
Grandmother Anya, near the house of which in the village of Ivanovka, the St. Kitland family has been living in the village of Ivanovka, for twenty years, began to notice how the nest settles, despite all the efforts of its inhabitants.
Birds put new twigs on top, and the bottom layer has already sank between the wires, about to collapse.
Of course, it is a pity for the family of storks who every year nesting at the farmstead, brought out and fed three or four chicks in the summer, but you do not want to stay without light.
As soon as the birds flew to the warm regions, grandmother Anya called the Tsarichanskaya RES, which owns the support.
I didn’t even expect it to react so quickly.
When our specialists came to Ivanovka, they were surprised that the nest was still holding, - said the technical director of DTEK "Dneprooblanergo" Sergei Berezovsky.
On the wires, which were, in fact, already inside the nest, weighing 150 - 200 kilograms, corrosion began.
At any time, the birds could die from the electric discharge.
And the locals risked to be left without light due to damage to the wires.
Therefore, linear mounters began an operation to save the nest, and not for the first time in our practice.
Scientists-ornithologists from Dnipropetrovsk National University, who developed a scheme for the transfer of the nest.
They also conducted trainings for employees of district networks.
The famous Dnipropetrovsk ornithologist Alexander Ponomarenko advised the power engineers at all stages of the reconstruction of the nests.
To begin with, it was estimated that more than 50 stork “apartments” are in the emergency condition.
For their reconstruction, special metal platforms were welded resembling a funnel.
The base was spitted with and the winding branches, and then the old nest was transferred there.
According to experts, it is enough to lay the old branches as a basis for the birds to know the nest and return to it.
Then the storks will build their own home.
A month ago, the first nest was reconstructed in the village of Peschanka of the Novomoskovsk district.
Next to the electric pole put a new reinforced concrete pillar and placed on it a platform with an old, already inhabited nest.
The whole operation cost the power engineers nine thousand hryvnias.
And the other day the same housework took place in the village of Ivanovka Petrikov district in the farmstead of grandmother Ani.
Here the platform was fixed in the same place, only raised above the wires.
Ornithologists are sure that cautious, conservative birds will not even notice in the spring that their “apartment” has undergone major repairs.
By the end of the year, the same reconstruction awaits four more nests in the Pokrovsky and Tsarichansky districts of Dnipropetrovsk region.
By the way, while some save rare birds, others are ruthlessly killed.
The other day, the sad news flew around the whole region - in the village of Ust-Kamenka of the Apostolovsky district, on the day of the opening of the hunt for pheasants, poachers for fun shot a swan family that lived on a local pond.
Noble birds were not afraid of people at all - the locals fed them and did not offend them.
When the villagers, hearing the shots, ran to the pond, four handsome swans already lay on the water dead.
Now the staff of the Apostolic district police department are investigating who shot at the birds listed in the Red Book.
Stuck in Chita American Boeing is preparing for departure
Conducted in the framework of the Treaty on open air defense observation flights over the territory of Russia and made an unplanned landing in Chita on Friday, November 1, at 8:30 Moscow time will leave the air harbor of the city.
The airport management allowed the departure of the board, having received money for fuel.
As reported at the airport, the plane will fly to Ulan-Ude.
According to other sources, he will go to the United States.
As reported, the plane flying to Ulan-Ude landed in the Trans-Baikal Territory due to fog.
Due to unpaid bills, he was not released from Chita airport.
On board the plane are 30 people, including the crew, they spent two nights on the territory of the airport, ITAR-TASS reported.
According to the terms of the Open Skies Treaty, people on board the aircraft do not have the right to go outside the airport of Chita, they can pass border control only at two Russian airports - in Kubinka and Ulan-Ude.
The Treaty on Open Skies was signed in 1992, with 34 states participating.
Observation flights are made over the territories of Russia, the USA, Canada, and European countries.
The main objectives of the Treaty are to promote transparency, to promote the monitoring of the implementation of arms control agreements, to expand opportunities to prevent crises and to resolve crisis situations within the OSCE and other international organizations.
Vitaly Mutko: Water Houses?
I think we're back 15 years.
Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko expressed his opinion about the riots in the stands during the match of the Cup of Russia “Shinnik” – “Spartak”.
I am a supporter of the fact that the organizers of sports events were responsible for all this: clubs, league, RFU.
But we see that they have taken a different position.
They are waiting for someone to come from the outside and put things in order.
This is a very good position, but not quite correct.
It is necessary to organize fans, clubs should invite their stewards, and not let the matter go.
We have now developed a special government decree on rules of conduct in stadiums.
After it is adopted, we will take care of this problem.
But I will definitely invite all the organizers of the football process.
I read an interview with Leonid Fedun.
The state, they say, give the law of fast.
It seems that these are the fans of Bayern in Yaroslavl came and all this arranged.
We are outsiders.
In general, it's terrible to see the tribune being watered from a boarding school.
And this is in the country that is preparing for the World Cup.
“I have a feeling that we returned 10-15 years,” Mutko said.
A cocaine addiction lawyer who warned the leader of the criminal gang about the police investigation, is imprisoned
42-year-old Basharat Dietta transmitted information to the criminal authority Neil Scarborough
The lawyer feared that his secret drug addiction would be revealed
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool royal court.
The prestigative lawyer, who told the drug lord about a major police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction, was jailed for three years.
42-year-old Bashart Ditta handed over to the criminal authority Neil Scarborough secret information about the investigation of his activities on drug trafficking after being threatened because of his cocaine addiction.
A lawyer who was nicknamed Bash and nicknamed the criminals as a “cool lawyer” was arrested at home in 2011 after a police surveillance operation for Scarborough, whom he previously represented at a drug-related court.
Officers noticed how 32-year-old Scarborough left three bags of cocaine at the house of a lawyer in the town of Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a dinner association of lawyers with colleagues.
The investigation revealed that Ditta “regularly used” the drug class A, after tests showed traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and on credit cards.
For eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to illegally obtain information about the arrests of two people on behalf of Scarborough, as well as one of his accomplices.
All four suspects were at the time under police surveillance as part of a large-scale investigation into the criminal organization for the sale of heroin and cocaine in Lancashire, Cumbria, Mercyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They and 32 other people were later imprisoned after police seized in a series of raids offrigeration and cocaine worth £1.5 million, as well as more than £200 thousand in cash.
42-year-old Ditta passed information to criminals for fear that his cocaine addiction would be revealed.
Today, at the Liverpool Royal Court of Ditt, who works for the law firm Forbes Solicitors, located in Blackburn, was covered by shame after admitting his guilt in two cases of deliberate obstruction of justice following a three-week court in the Liverpool Crown Court.
He confessed to possession of cocaine at a previous trial.
The lawyer’s revelation came after the police investigating Scarborough’s activities found that he regularly spoke to Diet on the phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspect and found him approaching Diet’s house in Blackburn and placed drugs of 60 percent clean in a black golf glove under a lawyer’s garbage dumpboxes.
Shortly after the transfer, Scarborough repeatedly called Dit, who was at dinner at the Ewood Park Park football stadium at the Blackburn Rovers team.
The lawyer returned home for drugs; there were nine conversations between them.
The court learned that Ditta “regularly used” cocaine after tests found traces of a class A drug in his hair, wallet and on his credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied the use of cocaine, said he spoke to the suspect’s dealer because he was his client and insisted that their communication was a “lawyer secret.”
During his detention, Ditta took his wallet and tried to take out several credit cards, but they were all confiscated, and he was also taken a hair sample.
During an interrogation in the police, he said that along with the workplace, he had a home office and clients came to his home on legal affairs.
However, the court learned that after important arrests, he called the largest participants in drug trafficking, a number of whom he previously represented in court to tell what detectives know about them.
In accusatory speech, Anne White said, “If anyone knows that you should not break the law, it’s a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer because he had entered into a too close relationship with certain clients.
The contact we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations will certainly be legitimate as he was their lawyer.
However, this largely crossed the boundaries of the usual relationship between a lawyer and a client.
He obstructed the police investigation as strongly as possible to allow these individuals to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not honor his profession, but disgraced her.
He became too close to certain customers, in particular Scarborough, and allowed him to doubt his disinterest.
Dietta pleaded not guilty and said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not, and I would like to convey the information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the meeting, senior officer Lee Halstead of the Lancashire police said: “Mr. Ditta has become a criminal lawyer as soon as he began to purchase drugs from organized crime.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly compromised and vulnerable to the main members of criminal groups, who instructed him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must follow the highest standards of professional ethics and inspire society with confidence and confidence.
Mr. Ditta betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind his profession.
The investigation into Mr. Ditt was conducted by the Lancashire unit on particularly dangerous organized crime, which had already reached a sentence for three cases of cocaine storage, and now in the obstruction of justice, demonstrating our desire to achieve a just punishment for criminals.
Let this case serve as a warning to criminals that no one is out of reach of the law.
We will find you and take you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years after pleading guilty to the conspiracy to supply heroin, cocaine and marijuana.
Another 35 people involved in the fraud were sentenced to 153 years for drug-related crimes.
On his website, Ditta organized a conversation in the form of questions and answers, in which he says that the job of his dreams is a lawyer representing clients with a death sentence in America, the ideal companion for him at dinner is Mohammed Ali, and motivation in work is inequality.
Manufacturers of jets are ficidating about the width of the seat, when high orders are at stake
There was a fierce dispute between the leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of tourist-class seats on long-distance flights, setting the tone for a fierce confrontation at the Dubai Aviation Exhibition this month.
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats provided on long-haul flights to economy class passengers, whose interests are not always in the spotlight of airlines, despite the fact that the volume of allocated space for them plays a key role in the claims about the effectiveness of the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus this week called for an industry standard that would provide at least 18 inches (46 cm) in the cabins of the economy class, but its main American competitor Boeing says that this should be solved by airlines.
The dispute is at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing in sales of increasingly large versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, and potentially record orders are expected at the event on November 17-21.
The layout of the rear of the aircraft – especially whether 9 or 10 people are sitting in a row – is central to statements about the economic efficiency of new “mini-au-bus” projects.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will accommodate 406 people, based on the seats in the economy class more than 17 inches in width, placed 10 in each row.
Airbus says the rival version of its A350 will carry 350 people in an economy class in 18-inch seats, located 9 in a row.
Aircraft giants often exchange strikes on technical issues through advertising in the professional press.
And now Airbus is directly addressing the public in front of the air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to become a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what could be the beginning of a new advertising war by showing financiers a slide depicting three people in a restaurant pressed against each other, called “Would you agree to this?”
“Boneing offers long-haul flights in the seats narrower than those of regional turboprop aircraft,” said Robert’s sales chief John Leahy.
With the change in diet, people gain weight, but the plane seats have not changed dramatically.
Between the early 1970s, when the wide-body Boeing 747 set the standards of modern long-distance travel, and the border of the century, the weight of the average American man aged 40 to 49 years increased by 10 percent, according to the US Department of Health.
The gird of the waist of the average American man of the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to statistics from the U.S. health service.
Airbus claims that its competitor adheres to the concept of seats of the 1950’s, when the average gird of the waist of those who were recently called the “reactive public” was already.
Airbus says it has ordered a study suggesting that an extra inch in the width of the seat improves sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ numbers by seat size and says manufacturers shouldn’t interfere with how airlines find a balance between tariffs and amenities.
According to her, studies show that the convenience of the cabin depends not only on the width of the seat.
“It’s actually all about giving airlines a choice and the ability to do what they think they should do to succeed,” said Boeing’s salon specialist Kent Craver.
They don’t want us to decide for them, what profit will bring them.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is to increase space on the sides, but for suppliers, this is increasingly becoming a factor that can affect profits.
Behind this dispute is the race for orders for aircraft, estimated at at least $ 700 billion at catalog prices in the coming decades – enough to change the ratio of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported for the first time in July, the location of the seats is exactly what fuels the rivalry in the battle between the latest jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing say a 20% increase in profitability per place in their last twin-engine long-haul models compared to the market leader in this segment, the 365-seater Boeing 777-300ER.
The claimed characteristics of Boeing are partly based on the comparison of the 10-seater 777X series with the original 9-seater layout of the series of the structural solution 777.
Winning in the specific cost is reduced when compared with the 10-seater layout currently used.
“The reason Boeing does this is to squeeze more seats and make your plane more competitive than our developments,” said Kevin Kenixon, head of passenger comfort in Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that salons with full 10-seed rows for the existing 777s indicate that many passengers prefer a dense seating, which can go hand in hand with lower tariffs.
“Furnitures eighteen inches would be perfect for passengers, but the commercial reality is that from a commercial point of view, Airbus’s offer is due to the threat from the 777 model,” said interior specialist Mary Kirby, founder and editor of the Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not supply seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
Jet-plane salesmen even carry roulettes with them to check out competing layouts.
Praising comfort, all manufacturers also offer aircraft with very tight layout of the cabin for budget airlines and regional flights.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10-seater rows, but says it hasn’t sold it yet.
Until recently, Airbus stressed the need for additional modifications of cabins, offering wider spaces at the aisle on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, as experts say, its call for a new industry standard is unlikely to “take off”, but can distract attention from the wave of sales of the 777X model.
Oleynikov: a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region completely subsidized
Vice-Governor of the Moscow region Yuri Oleynikov said that almost a third of rural settlements of the Moscow region are completely subsidized
In total, 187 settlements out of 288 receive subsidies from the regional budget.
In 2013, 187 settlements out of 288 received subsidies from the regional budget.
The share of subsidies in the volume of budget revenues of 122 rural settlements exceeds 50%, and 83 - one hundred percent subsidized.
Within the framework of budget security, about 25 billion rubles are sent from the regional budget," Oleynikov said.
Also, the vice-governor noted that only three urban settlements - Mytishchi, Odintsovo and Pushkino - the budget revenues amount to more than 1 billion rubles for 2013.
Revenues of rural settlements of many areas less than 3 million rubles, "this is not enough at all."
The cost of maintaining the local administrative apparatus in 88 settlements of the Moscow region is more than 70%, "while there is a decrease in the quality of services," said Oleynikov.
Earlier, he instructed the heads of municipalities of the Moscow region to think about what settlements need to be enlarged, unification in urban districts or change of administrative management system by the end of November.
These proposals will be worked out by the end of January.
Before that, the governor of the Moscow region said that as part of the administrative reform in the Moscow region, it is planned to reduce the number of subsidized rural settlements.
Also in the Mozhaisk, Kashira, Solnechnogorsk, Kolomensky districts, Lyuberts and Kotelniki there is a request for the consolidation of municipalities.
Discussion of this issue in the cities and regions of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Moscow regional Duma Igor Bryntsalov also said that in total, about 30 rural settlements in 12 districts of the Moscow region plan to unite in the framework of the upcoming admreform.
This is due to the fact that of the 178 rural settlements in the Moscow region, less than a third have an “acceptable” financial base, and 100 have a subsidized base.
Concern about security in Mozambique is growing as a result of the conflict of influential people
Under the top-down statue of Samorea Meshel, the founding president of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the center of Maputo to chanting slogans of peace at one of the rare demonstrations here.
“We want a return to peace; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, executive director of the investment company.
Fearing for the future of her country, she changed her business suit to a T-shirt decorated with “We demand security” in Portuguese, and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital’s Independence Square.
For two weeks, there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government troops and Renamo — one of the most violent clashes since the armor since the armor since the truce was made more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a well-known rebel movement that was supported first by the White Authorities of Rhodesia, and then by the South African government of the apartheid era as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the 1992 truce, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to slide back to a full-scale conflict, but recent events have forced foreign investors and local residents to be nervous.
Rates are high for a fast-growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion as investments in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US.
The ruling Frelimo party, the leading political force since 1975, and Renamo’s party accuse each other of the tensions.
Renamo’s party claims that the government has become the instigator of the last clashes, attacking its members in the province of Sofala, the traditional Renamom stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on former rebels then escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakam, the group's leader, Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for Renamo, told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo of initiating clashes, accusing the party of attacking soldiers.
President Armandu Gebuza has tried to dispel concerns about instability.
Hebuza told AFP, a French news agency on Wednesday that Mr. Dhlakama felt like a “loser” wanted to use “everything left of his strength to try to prove that he could impose his own decisions on the government.”
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist that they want to avoid war.
However, fears rose after reports that Mazanga declared Renamo’s refusal to renatomate the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the Financial Times that he meant non-compliance with the Frelimo party party.
“Our goal is to return to negotiations, but to take a serious scale,” Mazanga said.
Previous negotiations between the parties have done little to ease the tension that has intensified a series of clashes this year.
“These are two influential people (Geuba and Dhlakam) facing their foreheads,” said Joseph Hanlon, open-University lecturer and expert on Mozambique.
None of them is a good negotiator and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo’s party, which is trying to achieve electoral reforms, has already announced that it will boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted this pressure as an attempt to weaken the move to achieve concessions and financial bonuses from the government.
The share of the votes for Renamo has been declining since 1992, while the new party, the Momorac Democrat Movement (MDM), which is based on a former member of Renamo, is expected to improve its performance in this election.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gebuza, who is due to step down next year, when his second term ends, wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to resign as president,” Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capabilities Renamo has, but it has already carried out devastating and rapid attacks on police stations and cars on a key highway leading from north to south.
Most of the skirmishes took place in Sofala province, which is a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but includes Beira, a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, are using to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of railway tracks about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway.
Mazang was evasive when asked if Renamo would repeat the threat.
Renamo’s party wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazana said.
The instability has heightened government discontent, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow pace of development and recent kidnappings, says Fernando Lima, head of an independent media company Mediacoop.
“People think that the responsibility for the future of the country is borne by the government and the president, who must find a solution to these problems,” he says.
Omar Sultuan, a participant in the demonstration, said that people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelmo, they just want to renew the world, they want free access to roads,” he said.
The rules for the use of electronic devices on aircraft in Australia will remain in force
Passengers of Australian airlines will need to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, despite measures in the United States to soften the rules regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has allowed U.S. carriers to change their procedures so that passengers can read e-books, watch videos or play games on their devices during take-off and landing, provided they remain in Flight Mode.
Passengers can already do this during the main part of the flight, but it is annoyed for many that they do not have access to their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are considering this decision, which demanded that US airlines carry out a huge amount of work to meet the new requirements, but indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures in the near future.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also noted that they were considering the announcement, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases are still in effect in Australia.
“The Civil Aviation Safety Authority currently does not have special rules governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft,” he said.
This issue is governed by the rules that require air carriers to maintain safety at any time, and passengers to comply with the safety rules, which they are reported by crew members.
Virgin, which has already discussed with the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, the expansion of its entertainment system with Wi-Fi on board, was not against the changes, but said it would follow the regulator’s instructions.
“We would welcome the consideration by the Office of Civil Aviation Flight Safety of the issue of allowing the use of electronic devices, because we really think that this will improve the quality of customer service now that it (on-board wireless entertainment system) is on our aircraft,” the spokeswoman said.
Qantas said she would follow the rules currently in force.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and in the near future we do not plan to change it,” she said.
The FAU ruling applies to American airlines.
Nevertheless, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit passengers, and we will certainly carefully study the decision of the FAA and the reasons that caused it.
For US carriers, the impact of the ruling will vary from airline to the airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft have resistance to radio interference from mobile devices, as well as to review manuals, training materials, rules for the carriage of hand luggage and instructions for passengers.
“Once the airline has tested and confirms the immunity of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use portable, light electronic devices such as tablets, e-books and smartphones, at any height,” the FAW said.
In rare cases, poor visibility, the crew will give instructions to passengers to turn off their devices during the landing.
In addition, according to the recommendation of the group, the heavier devices shall be located under the seats or in the upper luggage compartments during takeoff and landing.
Obama Rejects His Words on Healthcare
Among the storm of criticism, President Obama backed down yesterday with respect to his often repeat, unequivocal promise that “if you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Seeing that hundreds of thousands of people receive notifications about the termination of services from their providers, Republicans have criticized the president in recent days for misleading American society.
Yesterday, Obama slightly corrected his initial public promise.
“Most people with health insurance that work can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Referring to what he called “news revitalization” about the termination of services, Obama urged Americans receiving notifications to look for other options on the market.
Most people will be able to get better, comprehensive health insurance plans at the same price or even cheaper than predicted.
“You will get better conditions,” he said.
The administration said that no one should be surprised that 5% of the population who buy insurance on their own may be forced to change plans because their coverage does not meet the new standards required in accordance with the law on affordable medical care.
“Let me tell these Americans directly: you deserve the best,” Sibelius said in a speech to the Committee on Energy and Trade of the House of Representatives in Washington.
Sibelius, who oversees the implementation of the law on affordable medical care, said that the launch of the Internet sale site has been “terribly bad” since October.
“I’m upset and angry as everyone else,” she said.
I want to regain your trust.”
The irritated Sibelius dropped the phrase caught by the microphone on the microphone behind her to an assistant at yesterday’s hearings in the house after a heated debate with a House member Billy Long, a Republican from Missouri, whether she herself is obliged to join Obama’s health program.
After more than three hours of hearings, Long once again urged Sibelius to say why the “architect” of the Affordable Medical Care Act did not voluntarily abandon government-sponsored insurance to purchase a plan through HealthCare.gov, which it now imposes on millions of Americans.
Dmitry Medvedev: the Greenpeace case will be considered fairly
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev on Friday announced that the case of Greenpeace activists will be considered in strict accordance with Russian legislation.
France may have no doubt that the case will be followed by law, we hear all concerns.
“We can guarantee the following laws,” Dmitry Medvedev said at a meeting with French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault.
Among the detained Greenpeace activists there is a French citizen.
Pierre Pisana, like the rest of the activists, have been charged with hooliganism.
“I asked whether we can expect a humanitarian gesture against the detained citizen,” Mr. Ayrault said.
“Our country cannot support activities that can damage the environment, no one has the right to violate the laws,” Medvedev said.
According to him, the activities of any structures that are trying to influence technologically complex and unsafe processes, including energy production, are dangerous.
He stressed that these objects “like a powder keg”, and recalled what was happening in the Gulf of Mexico, reports “RIA Novosti”.
Friend Semyon Varlamova said that the hockey player suffers from alcoholism
The friend of the hockey player Semyon Varlamov Evgenia Vavrinyuk said that he suffers from alcoholism, reports the Russian News Service.
“He has no idea how to stop drinking,” the woman said.
Recall that Vavrinyuk sued for beating on the goalkeeper of the Russian national team Semyon Varlamov, who is also a member of the Colorado club.
According to her, the hockey player dragged her off by the hair, and also beat her - after the attack, her arms, chest, abdomen and neck were damaged.
Varlamov himself came in with Denver’s police and confessed to the beating, describing in detail the incident.
He was arrested, but later released on bail of $ 5 000.
The court did not restrict the athlete in movements around the country, but forbade to approach Vavriyuk.
He also faces up to 6 years ' imprisonment for domestic violence.
Blizzard has released a 19-year-old platformer for free
Studio Blizzard has released its 1994 platformer for free on PC.
This is reported by WoW Insider.
According to him, the game became available in Battle.net in the classic Blizzard games.
However, some gamers note that at present only those users whose accounts belong to the American part of the service can download it.
For Russian users, the game is also not available.
As reported by the media, the version that Blizzard has now released on PC, outwardly does not differ from the original version of the game.
The Blackthorne soundtrack has also remained unchanged.
The Blackthorne platformer, which Blizzard released 19 years ago, originally released on the SNES console.
His events unfolded on the planet Tuul, whose inhabitants were divided into a dark and bright kingdom.
One day, the dark ruler Sarlack decided to kill the light king of Vlaros and become the sole ruler of the planet.
The main character of the game is the son of Vlaros Kyle, who was saved from death by sending to Earth.
Twenty years later, he returned to Toul to fight with the henchmen of Sarlak and protect the inhabitants of the planet from them.
The original Blackthorne was the first game that the studio released after its renaming to Blizzard Entertainment.
It was called Silicon & Synapse.
The publisher of Blackthorne was Interplay.
Coulson resorted to phone hacking to check on confidential message
Former News of the World editor Andy Coleson allegedly used “phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation” when trying to confirm false information about the novel by Charles Clarke, who was then the secretary of the interior minister.
The prosecutor, royal lawyer Andrew Edis, told the Old Bailey court that in May 2005, the newspaper News of the World had received unreliable news that Clark was dating his “attractive special adviser” Hannah Polby.
The newspaper commissioned private detective Glenn Mulkeir to hack into Polby’s voice mail and waited for her at home to interview, but Coulson also called her and left voice messages.
“The accusation believes that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not a man who will stand by someone’s house, hoping to catch someone by surprise, he is a man who likes to offer history to people to see what they say,” said Mr. Edis.
He said the News of the World newspaper used three ways to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation.
The editor is personally involved in the third.
Obviously, he knows about the second, about surveillance, he just has to.
What about the first one?
Does he know about the hacking of phones?
He says no, we say, “Oh, yes!”
Rumors of Clark's novel first attracted the attention of the editorial office of News of the World, when a source sexually interested in Ms. Polby was told: "Don't waste time, she's with Charles."
The voice cassette received from her phone at least three times was seized from Mulkair’s house in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on a private detective’s computer in which Miss Polby and her sister appeared as “Projects.”
During the period when she was under surveillance, Ms. Polby’s grandparents received anonymous calls with requests to provide information about her, Mr. Edis said.
At this time, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Wezerap controlled the travel of Ms. Paulby.
Leaving her voice message on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story we’re planning to publish tomorrow and that I would very much like to discuss with Charles.”
Mr. Edis said Coulson's involvement in the story was the same scenario as other influential people, such as former Interior Minister David Blankett.
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson had entered into a confrontation with Mr. Blankett about an affair with a married woman while he was dating his co-achered Rebecca Brooks, who was then married.
Coulson and Brooks denies collude with other people for phone hacking between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulkair, Thurlbeck and Uizerap confessed to hacking phones.
In the databases of the Ministry of Internal Affairs there is no group “Brotherly circle”, which in the United States ranked Leps
In the databases of the Russian security forces of the group “Brotherly Circle”, which Washington ranked the singer Grigory Leps, does not appear.
As noted by “Interfax” in the law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation, after the media there were reports about the inclusion by the US Treasury Department of Grigory Leps in the control lists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brotherly Circle”, all databases were checked, but such a group was not found.
The dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called “Russian mafia”, which allegedly operates abroad, according to law enforcement agencies.
“Even in the very name – ‘Brother’ Circle, there is a certain element of mystery, there is a hint of a secret box.
“All this is very similar to a PR campaign,” the source said.
On October 31, the US Treasury Department announced that the registers were included in its checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brotherly Circle” by Arthur Badalyan, Grigory Lepsveridze, Vadim Lyalin, Sergei Moskalenko, Yakov Rybalsky and Igor Shlykov.
Persons listed on this list are suspected of having links with some Vladislav Leontiev and Gafur Rakhimov, who are considered influential members of criminal groups and have been on the US sanctions lists since February 2012.
According to the American authorities, Grigory Leps "serves a courier for the delivery of money on behalf of Vladislav Leontiev."
In the production center of Grigory Leps refused to comment on the accusations of the United States against the singer, calling them “delirium”.
In 2011, U.S. President Barack Obama attributed the Bratsk Circle syndicate to “substantial transnational organized criminal groups” and instructed the Ministry of Finance to “undermine and prevent their global criminal operations.”
The blacklisting of the American Ministry of Finance entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him by persons living in the States.
Scientists have shed light on how the dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
Earlier studies have shown that satisfied dogs wag their tail in the right direction (from the dog’s point of view), while the alarmed dogs wave their tails predominantly to the left side.
But now scientists say that other members of the dog family may notice these subtle differences in the wolf of the tail and respond to them.
Professor Giorgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, says: “It is well known that people have the left and right sides of the brain in different ways involved in the formation of adoure that causes positive or negative emotions.”
Here we tried to look at it in other species.
He added that just like humans, dogs control the left side of the body and vice versa, and the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to versatile mowinging the tails of other dogs, researchers watched the animals as they watched movies about other dogs.
They measured the frequency of the animal heartbeat and analyzed their behavior.
It is likely that soon we will know why their tails sometimes head in one direction, and sometimes to the other
Professor Vallortigara said: “We showed dogs videos with dogs – either naturalistic versions, or silhouette to get rid of any other distorting factors, and we could manipulate the tail movement and direct the tail more to the left or right.”
When the animals saw that otherwise the unexpecting dog moved the tail to the right (from the point of view of the wagging tail of the dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But when they noticed that the tail leaned mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog’s tail wagging), their heartbeaturururururured and they looked alarmed.
Prof. Vallortigara said he didn’t think dogs had intentionally communicated with each other through these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs learned from their experience, what movements they should worry about and what ones should not.
He remarks: “If there are several meetings with other dogs and often wilt their tail to one side is associated with more friendly behavior, and the right side gives less friendly behavior, then the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
The researchers say these findings could give owners, veterinarians and trainers a deeper understanding of the emotions of their animal.
Dog behavior expert John Bradshaw, a visiting researcher at the University of Bristol veterinary school, said it was not the first study to check whether the left and right sides are important for dogs.
Last year, a group of scientists from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left, if they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right, if they look at a satisfied dog.
And in another scientific work of Victoria University in Canada, he reported: “Dogs were more likely to approach the robot dog, when the wilting of her tail was headed to the left, not to the right, instead of becoming anxious, the opposite behavior towards the Italian study.”
He said the differences could be because dogs in various studies did not fully perceive animals in movies or robot dogs as dogs.
It could be useful to explore how dogs respond to real dogs, he explained.
“While there is plenty of evidence for different mammals that two hemispheres of the brain are used for different purposes, many details have yet to be clarified, and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behavior can be recorded, we will probably soon realize why their tails sometimes head in one direction, and sometimes to another.
Is the elite of Europe ready to do business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with an obligation to gather business representatives and determine what changes the creators of wealth and jobs of the UK want to see in relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most complete survey of British business leaders, asking them to express their thoughts on the UK, business and the EU.
YouGov has surveyed more than 1000 business leaders representing a wide range of businesses in the UK in size, sectors and regions.
The conclusions of the survey will be a surprise to many.
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are currently looking for export opportunities outside Europe, paying special attention to countries that are modernizing and growing, while EU countries are in stagnation.
They want the government to prioritize new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil, rather than wasting time on a long and difficult process of reforming the confusing EU institutions.
When asked about their views on specific political issues, from antitrust regulation to product laws, most business leaders believed that the control of these key areas of competence should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, and business representatives said that the costs of regulation from Brussels now outweigh the advantages of being in the trading zone of Europe, even 40 percent of large enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European of all companies, agreed with this.
The latest and most indicative is that our survey of business executives has found that a clear majority wants the UK to pursue a course of a treaty change and on trade-based relations, not a policy.
This result, which was seen among enterprises of all sizes and largest business groups, shows that the business insists on a “significant change” that will return the authority back to the UK.
The rates are high – achieving changes in the contract and more favorable conditions for the UK will ensure a 16 percent vote shift to stay in the EU.
The prime minister should have no doubts: this poll shows that British business supports his plan to revise the terms of UK membership in the EU.
It also shows that the business expects the revision to lead to a significant shift in the current balance of power back towards the UK.
The best conditions for British businesses are possible and become more and more necessary as the eurozone embarks on the path of a closer economic and financial association.
Priority should be given to jobs and economic growth in the UK, and, as the results of our survey show, for business this means increased focus on trade and fundamental changes in the regulatory activities of Brussels.
Turkey's Politician Hunger Strikes Against Wall on Border with Syria
In mid-October, the authorities began construction of a separating wall in the area of the city of Nusaybin in the south-east of Turkey.
Local residents and representatives of the pro-Kurdish party of PMD spoke strongly opposed the construction.
The mayor of the Turkish city of Nusaibin Aisha Gekhan, who is on the border with Syria, has gone on a hunger strike, protesting the construction of a dividing wall on the Turkish-Syrian border, the press service of the Peace and Democracy Party (PMD) on Friday.
Police have repeatedly dispersed the protests.
Turkish Foreign Minister Muammer Güler first refuted the fact of construction, then said that the wall is being built to ensure the security of the borders.
“The mayor of Nusaibina Aisha Gekhan, a member of the PMD, went on a hunger strike, thus turning his protest against the construction of the wall into a deadly struggle,” the party’s press service said.
The mayor of the city believes that the construction of the wall is designed to isolate the Kurdish population of the two countries from each other, the Kurds crossed this border freely for half a century.
“This is an inhuman situation that the Kurds will never agree to,” Aisha Gekhan was quoted as saying by the party’s representatives.
According to the press service, on November 7, a rally against the construction of a separation wall is planned in Nusaibin.
This morning in the Sarat district, the driver of the car "Peugeot" drove into the oncoming lane on 115 km of the Odessa Reni highway, and collided with a bus in which there were six people.
This is reported by the press service of the Department of SES in the Odessa region.
As a result of the incident, the 31-year-old driver of the car "Peugeot" died.
A 55-year-old passenger and a 44-year-old bus driver, who was clamped by a leg, was injured.
Doctors provided the woman with first aid on the spot, she refused hospitalization.
Also, ambulance staff examined all other passengers.
Rescuers with the help of a crane lifted the bus and freed the bus driver, whose leg was clamped in the door of the bus.
In Siberia, you should not be a vegan: a greenhouse tomato will not replace the soup
Why vegetarianism is not suitable for living in Siberia, the correspondent of RIA Novosti found out.
People who completely abandon products of animal origin should not live in Siberia.
Here they can not postpone the winter without loss to health, and no greenhouse tomatoes will compensate them, according to the Novosibirsk nutritionists and doctors interviewed on the eve of the day of the vegan.
Drinking oil in liters
Strict vegetarianism, when they refuse not only meat and fish, but also from milk, honey, eggs, become a fashionable way of life.
However, nutritionists are confident that in Novosibirsk and other cities of Siberia to adhere to such strict norms in nutrition, at least, is not good for health.
Complete rejection of animal products is harmful.
Animal proteins contain essential amino acids that are very difficult to compensate with plant ones.
It is necessary to include at least milk or eggs in the diet, ”said nutritionist Marina Godai.
She cites the example of a fish containing essential fatty acid omega-3.
The richest vegetable oil is linseed.
"To consume it in the quantities necessary for a person, you need to drink in liters!" - says the nutritionist.
Doctors are sure that the residents of Siberia special attention should be paid to the diet in the winter.
This season, vegetarianism is particularly in doubt.
In the conditions of our realities, there are high demands on food.
In order not to freeze, you need an increased calorie content.
“If a person limits himself by animal products, respectively, he does not take this calorie content,” says the specialist.
This is agreed by nutritionist Olga Poznyak.
She adds that imported vegetables and fruits are not an option.
It is better for a person to eat mainly foods that are grown in the region of residence or where he was born.
The genetic code is tuned to the best assimilation and digestion of these products.
And in winter, people want to gnaw a cucumber, but a hot soup or something more saturated, ”the doctor explains his position.
According to her, from the fact that vegans can eat, various cereals, cereals, legumes, local vegetables, apples remaining in winter, frozen berries are really useful.
But this is definitely not enough for proper nutrition.
According to the doctor-gastroenterologist Claudia Arifulina, in the Siberians in organisms, the level of vitamins is sufficient only from mid-August to mid-September.
The complete transition to vegetarianism in our harsh natural conditions, when the temperature can change by 30 degrees per day and in May the snow lies, is inappropriate.
The body needs energy for life, and this is, first of all, fat, ”the medic states.
Doctors note that veganism is especially harmful to children and pregnant women.
Children grow up, they need building material, including in the form of amino acids.
And adhering to vegetarianism, we give them inferior.
Pregnant women also need an increased content of protein, vitamins and trace elements in the menu.
“Vegankas are underprivishing them,” God said.
Arifulina says that an adult is free to choose anything, “play the toys that he wants.”
He has an already formed body, a skeleton, organs.
And children should still eat fully.
If parents deprive him of some trace elements or amino acids, choosing for him what it will eat, it is just a violation of the rights of the child.
“The lack of certain substances for the development of the brain, vision, bones tomorrow will not be restored,” she says.
All medical specialists interviewed agree on the low quality of the winter-grown in greenhouses and imported vegetables and fruits.
The fact that they bring and grown in greenhouses, contains a smaller number of microelements necessary for us than (grown) in the open ground.
“The quality of the products is wrong,” says God.
Arifulina also notes that imported and greenhouse vegetables and fruits are far from ideal standards.
Sometimes the desire of producers to collect a larger harvest is detrimental to quality.
“Applocks do not turn brown on the slice, cucumbers turn yellow and mold quickly, tomatoes tasteless and unarafactory,” the doctor said, adding that they are most likely stuffed with excessive amounts of fertilizer.
And become suppliers not of vitamins, but fiber.
I do not agree with this by the head of the laboratory of the Siberian Institute of Agrarian Problems, candidate of agricultural sciences Vera Petruk.
She says that with the right approach and compliance with all norms and requirements in greenhouses, it is possible to grow full vegetables.
If they try to expel more from a square meter, then, of course, they will be watered more often, and overfeed the plants with mineral fertilizers.
For example, when there are too many nitrogen fertilizers, tomatoes grow rapidly, they are large, but watery and unsweetened, ”she explains, adding that the issue of quality, first of all, depends on the conscience of the manufacturer.
Russia Outside the Fight for Cultutage CAIDSs by Cars
Attempts to solve the transport problems of large cities were observed in most megacities of the world since the second half of the twentieth century.
As a rule, it was either about their reconfiguration and expansion of highways, or about attempts to reduce the demand for car trips, the number of cars and the time of their use.
The example of Singapore is widely known, where a rigid quota of the increase in the number of private cars has been introduced, and the right to purchase them is bought at auctions.
Its price can be two to three times the price of the car itself.
European cities, including London, have imposed a fee for entering the city center.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Stuttgart, the so-called green zones are introduced, where only cars with a certain eco-class are allowed to enter, which also uses high-quality fuel (including biofuels or electric vehicles).
The Beijing Environmental Protection Agency, for example, approved a “five-year clean air plan” in 2012 with a total cost of about 250 billion yuan (about $40 billion).
As the director of the Department for Transportation Control of the Municipal Bureau of Environmental Protection of Beijing, Lee Kunsheng, told Kommersant, the main goal of the five-year plan is to reduce the leading air pollutants by 20-35% by 2017, an increase in the number of private cars to a level not exceeding 6 million (now 5.2 million), as well as an increase of no more than 5% of fuel use per vehicle.
According to the agency, now vehicles in Beijing are responsible for 22.5% of total air pollution.
Among the main measures of the program is the restriction of the use of road transport, as well as the introduction of additional taxes for car owners.
Among other things, urban measures of the “green five-year plan” include the transition to European standards of fuel, the introduction of a local system of eco-standards and labeling of cars and fuel, the restriction on the entry of cars into the central part of the city, the ban on the use of obsolete vehicles (in addition, the creation of incentive financial programs to replace old cars with hybrid or electric vehicles), the development of electric vehicles (including public transport).
Among the automotive innovations of Beijing also includes a ban for all private cars on movement within the fifth transport ring (there are six of them in the capital of the PRC) one day a week (there is information contained in the vehicle number plate), as well as the issuance of registration plates for lottery-based cars (for example, in 2011, the first year of the lottery, the total number of permits for registration of private cars in Beijing was only a third of the number of 2010).
According to the current state program "Environmental protection for 2012-2020", the number of cities with high and very high air pollution should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 there were 138).
According to the Ministry of Natural Resources, in 2011, the “mobile sources” accounted for 41% of all emissions of pollutants into the atmosphere of cities.
In Moscow, for example, emissions from cars are ten times higher than industrial, and in St. Petersburg - nine times.
In Russia, so far only begin to think about the possibilities of restrictive regulation of cars on the streets of cities.
Mikhail Blinkin, Director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy at HSE, believes that administrative and fiscal measures aimed at suppressing the demand for road trips is obviously unpopular, they can be taken by society only if they are utterly universal.
In the case of Moscow, there is a unique problem associated with the structure of its fleet, where there are two clusters of poorly sensitive to any regulatory influences - official and personal cars, as well as cars of "privileged" users, the total number of which is at least 200 thousand. (about 5% of the total number of the fleet of Moscow).
Recently, urbanists from the ECOM center in St. Petersburg prepared a study where the balance of urban areas between residential development, road surface area and the number of vehicles is analyzed.
The main conclusions of the researchers: the city center is provided with roads by half times required, and most motorists living in the center do not use cars every day, leaving them for a long time in parking lots or just on the streets.
As a result, it is proposed to build not parking, but storage of cars, not to expand, but to reduce the roadway (in order that the streets become more friendly for pedestrians), as well as to limit the use and placement of personal transport within the territory of the protected area of the historical center (a total area of about 3212 hectares, covering a number of central areas of the city).
The rise in price of fuel will lead to a tax maneuver, which provides for an increase in the mineral extraction tax (MET) on oil simultaneously with the reduction of export duties and an increase in excise taxes.
According to experts, these measures can bring an additional 619.3 billion rubles to the budget.
Trip on the mud, rivers and jungle for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in rural areas in Cameroon
Bwellet and his team spend almost every weekend, taking hundreds of patients
In this Western African country, there are not so many doctors – only one in 5000 people
Vote here or through your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwellle is one of the top 10 characters in CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of the other 10 main characters to become the Hero of the Year of CNN.
This person will receive $ 250 000 to continue his outstanding work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle saw his father coming back to life and re-entered unconsciously, wandering through hospitals that were not properly equipped to help him.
Jamefa Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he had only a broken arm, but the resulting infection spread to the brain and caused a hematoma, which reminded herself for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” Georges Bwelle said.
If we had the money, we would have taken him out of Cameroon.
Instead, Bwellé accompanied his father for years in overcrowded clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could get.
“It’s not easy,” Bwelle said.
- You can leave the house at 5 am, run to the hospital to be the first, but you are not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some may die because they have to wait.
The situation hasn’t changed much since Bwellle’s father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for 5000 people in Cameroon.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
And even if Cameroonians could see a doctor, many of them would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the health care spending in it are private.
“Their only problem is poverty,” Bwelle said.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy their lives.”
Seeing the suffering of his father and many of his compatriots, Bwellet was determined to do something about it.
Last year, Dr. Georges Bwellle and his volunteer team performed 700 free surgeries.
He himself became a doctor and works as a vascular surgeon at the Yaoundé Central Hospital.
He also founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, which organizes trips to the countryside on weekends to provide free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have been assisting almost 32 000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to another 30 people are stuffed in vans, tied medical supplies to rooftops and travel to rough terrain to visit the villages in need of help.
They are not always lucky.
More than once they had to push cars through the rivers and dirt.
But when they come, they are met as real heroes: it is a holiday with songs and dances and the best rooms that locals can offer.
Free medical care in these villages is really a pretext for a holiday, and Bwellet with his broad smile and boundless energy is more than happy to join the fun.
The next morning, the brigade begins to receive hundreds of patients.
“We accept 500 people on every trip,” Bwelle said.
They come from all over the county within a radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they come on foot.
Each of these weekend clinics provides a variety of medical services.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites, and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may get crutches, donated glasses, or free birth certificates – documents required for school that many poor families simply cannot afford.
In the evenings, the brigade conducts simple operations under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually carried out in a school building, municipality or in the house; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the postoperative zone to make room for the next person.
Using a generator for lighting operating and sanitary handling equipment, Bwellé and his volunteers work until early Sunday morning.
This is an unbearable pace, but the dedication of the team usually helps to support village musicians.
“They’ve been hitting the drums all night so we’re awake and keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, members of the brigade go back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group, consisting of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students, has conducted 700 free operations over the past year, and they know that their help can make a huge difference to those they help.
One person explained that the free operation he received for the treatment of the hernia will allow him to work again.
“It will change the future for me and my family,” the man said.
In addition to these clinical techniques at the weekend and work at the hospital, surgeon Bwelle also works at night at private medical clinics around Yaoundé.
This second work, he said, provides 60% of the funding of its non-profit organization; the rest are covered by private donations.
“I don’t even know when he’s asleep,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year physician student at Drexel University in Philadelphia, a volunteer in the Bwellle group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that these campaigns can continue.
For future doctors and nurses such as O’Malley, coming from the US and Europe to join Bwell in the implementation of his tasks, this is an opportunity for practice they would never have at home.
“We were able to assist in operations where we helped remove blood stains or hold the tools for Dr. Bwelle,” O’Malley said.
As a second-year student, you would never have gotten such an opportunity in America.
Volunteer students usually pay for their travel to Cameroon, often arriving with donated medicines.
But upon arrival in Yaoundé, their meals, transport and training are paid for by Bwellé.
“He’s a hero, no doubt,” O’Malley said.
He gives his life to this organization, and his desire to help the people of Cameroon indefinitely.
For Bwell, almost constant workload is not a difficult test.
To help to live a happy life to others, to fulfill the promise given to his father is something that brings him great joy.
“I’m so happy when I’m doing this job,” Bwelle said.
- And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Go to ASCOVIME website and see how you can help.
Behind the "Russian mafia" in the United States finally fixed a new name - "Brotherly Circle"
This week, the blacklist of the “Russian mafia” in America was replenished with new names and four companies.
The US Treasury Department has introduced three representatives of Russia, two citizens of Uzbekistan and an Israeli in the “Brothermic Circle”.
One of the Russians was the famous singer Grigory Leps, whom the United States suspects of transporting money for members of the group.
In total, there are 22 people on the U.S. blacklist, involved in the “Brothermal Circle”, and six affiliated organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts express doubts that such an organization really exists.
“The statement about the ‘Frarib Circle’ is more like an attempt to unite scattered criminal gangs,” said Mark Galeotti, an expert on organized crime and a professor at the University of New York.
In his opinion, the “Brotherly Circle” reflects the popular perception of the “Russian mafia”.
“I have not met anyone in Russian law enforcement agencies or anywhere else to confirm the existence of such a criminal organization,” the American Center for the Study of Corruption and Organized Crime said.
Professor of George Mason University Liz Shelleyley agrees with Mr. Galeotti.
“If they work together, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization,” she said.
In the middle of last year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the “Brotherly Circle” unites to a greater extent close Russian thief in the law of Aslan Usoyan, known as Grandfather Hassan.
Criminal authority was assassinated in January of this year.
Thus, the activities of Lasha Shushanashvili and Zakharia Kalashova, who joined the list in 2012, were closely connected with Grandfather Hassan, and another member of the list, Temuri Mirzoev, was Grandfather Hassan as her nephew.
However, Mr. Galeotti noted that some individuals were not related to Usoyan.
In his opinion, all of them were united rather by common financial and criminal interests, such as the supply of drugs from Afghanistan.
Meanwhile, the scandal around the inclusion of Grigory Leps in the “Brotherly Circle” – the beloved singer of Russian President Vladimir Putin – attracted the attention of the Kremlin.
Naturally, we expect that we will receive more detailed information from our American colleagues-partners, in connection with which such a decision was made, why he was included in such lists, ”said Dmitry Peskov, press secretary of the head of state.
In any case, he (Leps) is a citizen of the Russian Federation.
As well as the interests of all citizens of the Russian Federation, its interests will be protected.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to come back as prime minister, but admits that a return is unlikely.
On the eve of the evening, in an interview on the fifth anniversary of leaving office, the 59-year-old politician outlined his views on various aspects of domestic policy.
Since retiring in June 2007, after ten years as leader, Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting most of his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador in the four Middle East peacekeepers.
Asked if he would have been back as prime minister, Blair, a London-based Evening Standard, said, “Yes, of course, but it’s unlikely to happen, so ...’”
Milan head coach Massimiliano Allegri expressed regret about the draw in the match of the 10 round of the Italian championship with Lazio.
The specialist also noted that the failures at the start are due to a series of injuries of leading players.
I am very sorry that we did not manage to win, - quotes Tmw the words of Allegri.
The team played a good match, creating 3-4 good opportunities.
In the first half, we didn't let anything at Lazio.
In the second, the Romans added, but in general I can not say that we lost concentration.
I should have won.
Last season we completed the task of getting into the Champions League.
Now we are lagging behind the schedule, but this is due to a series of injuries to key players.
Rami and Honda?
They are very good players, with character.
But our composition is still good.
Take a look at the Kakah who held a high-level meeting.
British police handing Assange a notice of extradition
British police today handed over a notice of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and harassed asylum.
In Scotland Yard, they handed the 40-year-old Australian a “official demand to surrender” with a demand to appear at the police station, adding that in case of non-compliance with this requirement, he would be further subject to arrest.
Assange faces extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual offences after he has exhausted his capabilities under British law when the Supreme Court rejected his extradition appeal earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would transfer it to the United States, on June 19, he took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard “unched a 40-year-old man with an official demand to surrender, which obliges him to arrive at the police station a day and time of our choice,” the spokesman said.
He still violates the terms of release on bail.
The Embassy refused to comment on the delivery of the police notification.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States to present himself with possible charges of espionage after the publication of more than 250 000 American diplomatic cables to the secret WikiLeaks website.
Now Roman Senchin is in Paris at the presentation of his novel "Yeltyshev", translated into French.
Recall that this novel was his novel that became the finalist of four awards: “Clear Polyana”, “Russian Booker”, “National Bestseller” and “Big Book”.
And last year, the writer for this book was awarded the prize of the Government of the Russian Federation in the field of culture.
Roman Senchin is an undoubted leader in the generation of the current thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prose writers.
Almost every publication of his hard, built on the modern life material of stories and stories causes hot debate among critics of various directions.
It can be argued that the articles collected together about the prose and journalism of Senchin, reviews of his books and magazine publications create a curious and unexpected landscape of Russian literature from the late 1990s to the beginning of 2010.
In the discussions about the works of "one of the most controversial modern writers", according to critic Sergei Chuprinin, it is mostly about what its participants understand by the word "literature" as they see the present and future not only of our literature, but also of our lives.
Unfortunately, the volume of the book did not allow it to include most of the articles and reviews from the regional media and the blogosphere.
Analytical and review articles are given, as a rule, in abbreviation in the sections "Paragraphs..."
Snowden could be questioned in Russia
Former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden, most likely, will not travel outside of Russia to testify on the wire conversations of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As a source familiar with the situation told Interfax on Friday, the American can answer the questions of representatives of the Prosecutor General’s Office of Germany in writing or in person in Russia.
The departure of Edward Snowden outside of Russia is practically excluded.
“In this case, he will lose refugee status and can be extradited to Washington by US-alloy countries,” the source said.
"At the same time, in principle, the German Prosecutor General's Office could send its representatives to the Russian Federation or convey written questions to Snowden," the source added, adding that this issue should be worked out at the interstate level.
Earlier, the Deputy of the German Bundestag Hans-Christian Strebele said that Edward Snowden is ready to testify in the case of wiretapping by the American special services of the negotiations of the German Chancellor.
Snowden is ready to testify to German law enforcement agencies either in Moscow or in Germany.
The ex-CIA officer made it clear that he knew a lot.
Despite the fact that the US NSA blocked all its movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, for this it is necessary to clearly determine all the conditions for his arrival,” Strebele told Euronews.
Snowden’s lawyer Anatoly Kucherena, commenting on the statement of the source of Interfax, said that his client can cooperate with German investigators, but when and how – will decide for himself.
U.S. citizen Edward Snowden, who worked for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and the CIA, fled to Hong Kong in May 2013, after which he published information about secret U.S. intelligence agencies on Internet surveillance.
Snowden flew through Moscow in transit, but could not leave the airport due to the fact that his passport was canceled by the US authorities, which in absentia presented him with serious charges, and until the beginning of August remained in the transit zone of Sheremetyevo airport.
On August 1, Snowden received a document granting him temporary asylum in Russia for a period of one year and on the same day left Sheremetyevo.
Yesterday, the lawyer of the American Anatoly Kucherena said that his client got a job in a “major Russian company”.
The NSA’s surveillance of Angela Merkel last week was reported by German media.
According to journalists, the Americans began to listen to the chancellor’s telephone conversations back in 2002.
The tracking station was allegedly at the U.S. Embassy in Berlin.
The German authorities after the publication of this information said that surveillance of Merkel violates the laws and sovereignty of Germany.
Announced the release of the Land Rover racing series
Inside are racing seats and six-point seat belts, as well as an internal communication system.
Additionally, you can get upgraded brakes, a package of services that provides access to the Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support and storage of the car between activities.
Drew Bowler, managing director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “Ralley members contacting the Bowler have changed.”
Some of them are not experienced riders, but people looking for excitement, adventure and access to world-class events.
We are pleased to offer such a path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that this format offers a new way to try various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad, as well as prepare participants for the difficult conditions and realities of the rally-raid.
We were very happy to develop a Defender Challenge car – it will be a really exciting championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge provides one day in February for training and testing, as well as the opportunity to take part in desert activities in North Africa and the Middle East.
Children should study myths and legends as a “model of life,” says the author.
The tales of the Torah could show that “gross force cannot overcome the refined trick,” and the legends of King Arthur show how important it is to have a dream.
Saying that many myths will be “too wild, too scandalous and in some cases too obscene for teaching in schools,” Crossley Holland advocates “careful selection” of age-appropriate texts.
“I think it’s wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been in favour of putting them into the study program for twenty years.
He added that “excessive moralizing” authors and teachers “reach out” for children, and the main ideas are “sublimated” into fascinating stories.
Crossley-Cholland, who translated Beovulf from the Anglo-Saxon language, and also wrote “A Collection of Norwegian Myths” for Penguin and British Folk Tales, said, “You may certainly have intentions, but you’d better keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps a big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to feel some hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but it is necessary that there be an innate understanding of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; it has been revealed through history, not clearly formulated.
The old principle is to show, not to tell.
Goldman Sachs warns of risks to Russian economy
Goldman Sachs has warned of growing risks to the main driver of fragile economic growth in Russia – consumption.
This is primarily a crisis of non-payment for unsecured consumer loans and massive reductions in workers.
Our main concern now is not that growth has slowed, but rather the structure of this growth.
Recently, it is completely due to consumption, which almost does not slow down,” said the chief economist of Goldman Sachs for Russia Clemens Grave, presenting yesterday the quarterly report of the investment bank on the Russian economy.
Now the nominal growth of wages in Russia is about 10%.
With inflation of 6%, it will be able to provide future consumer demand at about the current level, Goldman Sachs expects.
But the profitability of Russian companies is falling, so, most likely, they will optimize staff costs.
Today we see a significant increase in the share of wages in GDP: if wages are growing by 10%, then GDP - only by 2%, - explained Mr. Grafe.
Companies have faced a reduction in profitability.
If it does not grow, it can lead to redundancy and an increase in unemployment.
Russian business can not raise wages, says the chief economist of Barclays Capital for Russia and the CIS Vladimir Pantyushin.
Unemployment near historical lows, competition for workers is high.
To lure employees from the outside or keep the current ones, employers have to raise salaries.
Consumption in Russia is supported by a very rapid growth of consumer lending.
According to Mr. Graf, due to the extremely high rates on consumer loans, this type of lending does not have a multiplicative effect on the country's economy.
“We have not seen any benefits for the economy from the growth of consumer lending, the money does not diverge on the economy, but return to the same banks in the form of interest payments,” the economist said.
But the problem is different - Goldman Sachs expect an increase in overdue loans.
They are taken mainly by poor people who have nothing to provide for security.
Interest on such loans is high.
As a result, they are often not returned,” said Mr. Graphe.
Therefore, the second threat to the growth of the economy in Russia is a possible crisis of non-payment of unsecured loans.
Director of the HSE Banking Institute Vasily Solodkov already sees signs of a brewing banking crisis.
Small credit institutions, having no access to cheap resources that state banks have, were forced to raise funds of the population at high interest.
In response, state banks went on the path of war and began to reduce credit rates, - the economist continues.
Small credit institutions cannot issue loans at the same interest rates, otherwise they will have a negative interest margin.
If state-owned banks do not refuse dumping, Russia faces a full-fledged banking crisis, Vasily Solodkov believes.
The deprivation of licenses of a number of banks in recent weeks, the economist considers the harbinger of mass collapse.
“The state banks themselves will not cope with this situation: the deposit insurance system was initially not designed for a systemic crisis,” the head of the institute warns.
But the growth of consumption will slow down without a crisis of non-payment, the investment bank believes, due to the refusal to index the salaries of civil servants and the military, laid down in the current version of the draft budget.
Partially, the blow to consumption will be mitigated by the freezing of tariffs of natural monopolies (and, as a result, a decrease in inflation).
But only partially: if the investment does not grow (and there are no prerequisites for this yet - see. the help), the growth of consumption will still slow down, Goldman Sachs is sure.
Vladimir Pantyushin from Barclays Capital does not yet see the prerequisites for the implementation of pessimistic scenarios.
“The main risk is still the fall in the price of oil,” he says.
According to him, the Russian economy will begin to decline at the cost of oil below $ 90 / barrel.
Goldman Sachs also noted that the Central Bank is not yet able to reduce interest rates in the economy.
There is a paradoxical picture: inflation has decreased, and banks began to raise rates.
This may mean that they did not believe the Central Bank, which announced the transition to inflation targeting,” Clemens Graphe said.
The policy of the Central Bank does not affect market rates, affects only interbank lending rates.
“For the Central Bank, this is the collapse of all hopes,” Clemens Grafe said.
The money received at auctions of the Central Bank, banks use not for lending to the economy, but to manage their liquidity
As soon as the rate decreases, the exchange rate immediately changes, this means that the funds are trying to go on speculation against the ruble.
“Sooner or later, the Central Bank will understand that this strategy does not work,” Mr. Grafe said and recalled that the state plans to put the ruble in “free swimming” by the end of 2015.
But you will have to either do it earlier, or raise the key rate of the Central Bank (5.5%), he said.
According to him, the ruble exchange rate is now artificially overestimated by 10%.
I will ruscape only one road - to weaken, - the expert concludes.
But if the Central Bank drops in financiers at least a shadow of doubt that the liquidation of the currency corridor is not part of the policy to weaken the ruble, it can bring down the ruble much more.
Snowden agrees to testify about Merkel’s wiretap
Bundestag deputy Hans-Christian Strebele met with Edward Snowden.
During the conversation, the question of whether Snowden could be questioned as a witness by the Prosecutor General of Germany in the case of a possible wiretapping of the German Chancellor’s phone by special facilities of the United States.
Snowden expressed his readiness to give the necessary testimony.
The meeting could have taken place either in Moscow or in Germany.
He made it clear, said Hans-Christian Strebele, that he knows a lot.
And despite the fact that the National Security Agency, led by Keith Alexander, blocked all his movements, Snowden is ready to come to Germany.
However, first it is necessary to clearly define all the conditions for his arrival. .
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers are starting to take action in response to the scandal surrounding U.S. spy programs.
The Senate Intelligence Committee yesterday approved a bill imposing additional restrictions on the activities of the US Department of Electronic Intelligence.
FAU: “Air passengers can now use gadgets on airplanes (but not call from a mobile phone)”
Air passengers will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the flight to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music, but not talk over mobile phones, according to the long-awaited new guidelines published Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect the changes to happen immediately.
How quickly such a change is implemented will vary depending on the airline, said FAA administrator Michael Worta at a press conference.
Airlines will have to show FAA how their aircraft meet the new guidelines and that they are updating their training manuals for flight crew members and regulations for styling devices to comply with the new guidelines.
FAW said it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in airplanes.
Delta and JetBlue were among the airlines that have already submitted plans.
“Decilitating on the state of the plan, we could approve the expansion of the use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAW said.
Currently, passengers are required to disconnect their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the plane door closes.
They should not overtake them until the plane reaches a height of 10 000 feet and the captain gives “good”.
Passengers must turn off their devices again when the plane is down for landing and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
In line with the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are adequately protected from electronic interference may allow passengers to use these devices during take-off, landing and taxiing, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at high altitudes are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glaiding, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attenders, welcomed these changes.
“Once the new policy is implemented successfully (and we are going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be a win-win option,” Glainging said.
We are frankly tired of feeling “joying in school” when it comes to this issue.
But the Internet connection for surfing, exchanging emails, text messages, or downloading data will still be banned at an altitude of less than 10 000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will be asked to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices to the aircraft mode.
Thus, there is still no “Words with friends” – an intellectual Internet game in which actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011, when there was a sensational case: the actor was removed from the American Airlines plane for refusing to turn off the device at a time when the plane was at the landing.
And heavier devices, such as laptops, will still need to be put in the luggage compartment, as they can injure someone if they fly throughout the cabin.
Calls from a mobile phone in flight will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory powers on phone calls belong to the Federal Communications Commission, not the FAA.
FAW may lift the ban on some electronic devices during takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transport safety expert at CBS News, said cell phones were still considered a risk.
“Cell phones are a real problem, not only because they can potentially interfere with navigation devices, but we know from the FCC that they can interfere with cell towers when the plane is in the air,” Rosenker said.
The branch advisory committee established by the FAA to study this issue recommended last month that the government allow the wider use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been increasing on the FAA to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics, such as Missouri Democratic Senator Claire McCasickel, argue that there are no good reasons for security reasons for the bans.
Compliance with restrictions is also becoming increasingly difficult to ensure, as the use of devices has become widespread.
Some studies show that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore instructions to turn off their devices.
FAA began limiting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to reports of interference for navigation and communication equipment, when passengers began to carry FM radios – high-tech gadgets of the time.
The new airliners are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also being developed and approved by the FAA as resistant to electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers the use of Wi-Fi at cruising altitude for several years.
Airplanes modified for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of liners are adapted for wider use of electronic devices according to new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today’s electronic devices typically emit radio signals of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
Devices for reading e-books, for example, emit only minimal signals when pages are turned.
But the signals become more powerful when the devices load or send data.
Among those who sought to ease restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers, Amazon.com was the company.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded an entire airliner with their devices for reading the Kindle e-books and flew on it to check for problems, but did not find them.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about whether the use of devices posed any risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Air Passengers said that he considers interference from the devices real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee said there were only individual pilots reporting confirming that devices could interfere with aviation systems, and most of these messages are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAU allow pilots to require passengers to disable the devices during landings on instruments in a limited visibility.
A group of representatives of the tourism industry welcomed these changes, calling them a sensible step towards passengers who now use a variety of technological devices.
“We are delighted to have FAWs admit that passenger comfort is not incompatible with safety and protection,” said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Tourism Association.
Vilnius suspects Moscow of trying to slander the Lithuanian president
Russia intends to carry out information provocations against high-ranking officials of Lithuania and Eastern Partnership countries - such a statement was made to the BNS agency in the Department of State Security of the Republic (DGB).
Information about this is published on the portal DELFI.
According to the report, in particular, Moscow is going to “incribe” the President of Lithuania Dahl Grybauskaitė and publish falsified documents allegedly found in the Russian State Archive, which relate to the facts from the biography of the Lithuanian leader.
According to the intelligence service, the information attack is being prepared by the Department of Analysis of Public Processes of Management of the Presidential Administration of Russia on Interregional and Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.
The structure is headed by Yevgeny Umerenkov, who visited Lithuania and took part in the congress of the Lithuanian People’s Party.
Also, the participant of the operation is allegedly an employee of the department B. Smirnov.
According to the special service, Smirnov, under the guise of scientific work until the end of 2012, regularly came to Lithuania and contacted local politicians, political scientists and media representatives.
Now Smirnov is banned from entering the country.
On the eve of the President of Lithuania Grybauskaitė said that she knows about the information information attack on it.
In her opinion, the main reason is the successful chairmanship of Lithuania in the Council of the European Union and the “advantage of the country to energy independence”
The Lithuanian leader has repeatedly criticized the actions of the Russian authorities.
So she stated that in the Kremlin to Lithuania are “not respectable enough”.
In addition, Grybauskaitė accused the head of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, of putting “is only demands” to Lithuania.
Recall that in September, Rospotrebnadzor suspended the import of Lithuanian “milk” to Russia.
It was reported that the quality of products does not meet sanitary and epidemiological standards.
Then the Lithuanian leader said that if Russia does not lift the ban, the government of the country should prepare an appeal to the WTO.
New anti-nicot vaccine may deprive the process of smoking pleasure
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could deprive the process of smoking cigarettes pleasure.
One dose of the vaccine was able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before the human trials, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystalle of the Waille Cornell College Medical College in New York said the first results were encouraging.
“We very much hope that such a vaccine strategy can finally help millions of smokers who have tried to quit by trying all the methods available on the market today, but found that their nicotine addiction is strong enough to overcome it with these modern means,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been designed to carry genetic information for the production of antinicotin antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to produce a stable flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track any nicotine molecules in the blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine impact.
In the tests, the vaccinated mice, which were subsequently given nicotine, continued their normal activities.
And the mice that were not given the vaccine were “relucidated,” and this is a sign that nicotine reached their brains, the researchers said.
These experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
To maintain a high level of antibodies, injections had to be done so often that they turned out to be expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine will probably be much lower because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human vaccine were completely safe, it could be given to children before they want to try a cigarette, preventing nicotine addiction.
But it’s more likely that it will be used by smokers to quit smoking.
“They will know that if they start smoking again, they won’t get pleasure from this vaccine because of the nicotine vaccine, and it could help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned that more research was needed.

Frontier Airlines will charge for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge passengers to $100 for carrying hand luggage on board their flight.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for hand luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, although their ad on Wednesday stated that passengers would be able to keep their entire jars.
The new hand-cook board applies to bags in the upper luggage compartments, so small bags placed under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if travelers would pay only by getting to the landing.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O’Malley said a $100 fee should make passengers take care of payment in advance.
“We don’t want to charge for that,” she said.
Airlines began charging a fee for the first and second bag handed over in 2008.
Passengers trying to avoid these fees fill as much as they can in the hand luggage placed in the upper luggage compartments, which is why these compartments often do not have enough space.
Fees are one way to get passengers to carry less on board.
O'Malley said that this new collection wasn't really for the sake of making money.
The fact is that the most loyal Frontier customers say that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the upper luggage compartments.
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
This means that one passenger in the queue at the exit to the Frontier flight can get the opportunity to carry the bag for free, while the next passenger in the queue can pay $100 for the same bag.
O’Malley said that changing the procedures on the website and at Frontier’s check-in desks are designed to ensure that passengers are aware of the gathering before they get to the landing.
The new Frontier collection for hand luggage will not begin to be charged until the summer, although the date has not yet been set.
Passengers often complain about baggage fees and other charges, but airlines love them.
They argue that baggage handling costs money, and passengers who need this service have to pay for it.
Many on Wall Street consider the addition of luggage fees a sign that airlines charge enough money to cover the cost of air travel after several years of losses.
However, most of them did not concern the fees for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for hand luggage three years ago, and another discounter Allegiant Air later followed suit.
The only other airline with this collection is the Hungarian Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the added fees.
According to his assessment in a report from December 2011, the fee for hand luggage brings Spirit $ 50 million a year.
Sorensen, a former top manager for Midwest Airlines, was recently flying a Spirit flight, and he was wondering what he would find a landing when passengers faced unusual training Spirit for hand luggage.
“The landing process was the smoothest I’ve seen in my career in airlines,” he said.
I expected to see the grill of teeth and the appearance of a fight at the exit to the landing.
The plane was full, he said, “and the landing went fast.”
Frontier also follows Spirit for $2 coffee, tea, soda or juice.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive soda or juice can keep the whole jar and that the coffee share will be provided for free.
She will still give free water.
US Airways briefly tried to charge for a drink in 2008, but abandoned it seven months after passengers began to complain and no other large airline followed suit.
Frontier’s card fee initiative, when passengers do not buy tickets directly from the airline, is its last measure to attract customers to their website.
Airlines pay online ticket sellers, such as Orbitz, from $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to encourage passengers to buy tickets directly from them, rather than contact a travel online agency.
However, Frontier went the farthest in this area.
In September, she began giving half as the bonus miles of a frequent flyer to customers who bought tickets through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, she cut off the premium number of miles of up to 25 percent of the trip.
So, a 1000-mile trip with Frontier, purchased from an online travel agency, would allow you to get 250 miles.
In addition, passengers can choose a place in advance only if they buy tickets directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a base of loyal customers in its hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and becoming unprofitable.
Revenues fell by 9 percent, and flight opportunities fell by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to a financial statement released Wednesday by the parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic is trying to improve Frontier’s finances as part of the airline’s sale.
Putin has achieved impunity for his friend Assad
And now - news from overseas, namely from Syria, where, as we learned today, Israel struck at Russian-made missiles, which were reportedly intended for Hezbollah.
Today, Syria has fulfilled an important condition - to destroy its chemical weapons production by November 1.
This was done as part of an agreement brokered by Russia and allowed the United States not to conduct a military operation, to which they came close this summer.
More about the weapons and what all this means for the Syrian president will tell our main international correspondent Richard Engel.
Washington said the Assad regime would be punished for it.
More than 1400 civilians, including hundreds of children, were killed in August by poison gas.
And the punishment has come.
But not in the form of American bombing, but in the form of a deal that Assad’s friend, Vladimir Putin, has staged.
Syria will abandon its chemical weapons by the middle of next year.
And today is an important milestone.
A group of international experts reported that Syria had disabled the declared chemical weapons factories.
A longer-term and more difficult task is to destroy tons of chemical weapons and its components.
As we understand, this is about a thousand tons.
Washington used to say that Assad’s days were numbered.
I think Assad should go.
The question is not whether this will happen, but when it will happen.
He is no longer legitimate and has to leave.
But Assad remains.
And he feels even more confident.
His troops still use artillery, missiles and napalm.
His opponents are disconnected and poorly armed.
His people are forced to leave their homes, many are starving.
Some have to eat leaves and cats.
Many believe that Bashar al-Assad escaped punishment for mass murder.
The agreement on chemical weapons is called the success of diplomacy, the inspectors were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and Assad himself made the impression of a person ready to cooperate.
Today in Washington, the U.S. ambassador in Syria had to answer difficult questions.
When a child dies of hunger, his mother is unlikely to be easier because he was not killed with chemical weapons.
Assad is still holding up.
It changes the weapon to power.
Tomic will work 240 hours for an extremist video in the social network
The Leninsky district court of Tomsk sentenced to 240 hours of compulsory work of a resident of the city, which posted a video of an extremist orientation on the social network, a representative of the press service of the regional court told RIA Novosti on Friday.
According to the court, in March 2013, the man posted on his page in the popular social network video, which is included in the federal list of extremist materials.
A criminal case was initiated against him under the article of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation “Actions aimed at inciting hatred and enmity, as well as humiliating the dignity of a person committed in public”.
“The Leninsky district court considered this case in a special manner and found the man guilty of committing the above-mentioned crime, imposing a sentence of 240 hours of compulsory work,” the interlocutor of the agency said.
She added that the man fully admitted his guilt.
Parents of Intersex Children Can Choose ‘Uncertain Gender’
Germany became the first European country to recognize the third sex in children born with the external genitalia of the intermediate type.
Newborns will no longer necessarily be attributed to the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to name any sex of such children, allowing parents to indicate gender as “uncertain” or “unidentified” in their birth certificates.
The purpose of the law was to remove pressure from parents who may have made hasty decisions on sex surgery for newborns, and counteract discrimination against intersex people.
One intersex, according to the BBC, said many years later, “I’m not a man or a woman.”
I will remain a patchwork product created by the doctors with bruises and scars.
Approximately one in two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have intersexvolt, one of about 60 pathological conditions that are diagnosed with “dividrome impairment” is a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, gonads (testariums or testes) or unusually developed external genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not sufficiently studied, but most experts in the United States say that if the sex cannot be determined, it is better to use all the available information and assign it to wait and track the psychological and physical development of the child before the operation, if at all.
The New York psychiatrist, Dr. Jack Dresher, who specializes in gender identity issues, said the new German law “sounds like a good idea.”
Intersex children create an ethical dilemma.
“Some people have life-threatening disorders that require surgery, but most children do not have them,” he said.
You can assign a gender without surgery and then see how the personality develops.
The science of how a child will develop any gender identity is not very accurate.
No one can answer questions about why this is happening.
It’s like a mystery why people are gay.
The report, sent to the European Commission in 2011, describes intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender, since their condition is not related to gender, but to their biological structure, which does not correspond exclusively to either male or female sex, but is typical for both both at the same time or not characteristic of any of them.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sex traits, such as muscle mass, hair distribution, breast and physique; primary sex traits, such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provides a general understanding of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as on the level of harassment, cruelty and prejudice crimes.
Boys with gender deviations now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal are already allowed to put men's, women's or "third sex" in their official documents.
In June, 52-year-old Australian resident of Nory May-Walley became the first person in the world to be recognized as “silent”, defending in court the right to maintain “uncertain” sexual status for life.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the German passports will use the third designation in addition to M and F-X, that is, intersex.
In neighboring France, gender issues are still in trouble, according to a news release on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from France, this pronounced Catholic country, signed a petition to remove the “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also expressed disagreement with the German law, writing that “in a situation where the world is drawn into a new state where the sex is the subject of choice, and sexual activity is not, we turn over two more pillars of civilization.”
One mother of a newborn baby from Maryland also told the Baby Zone website that she would prefer to have sex at birth.
“Breducing a child is hard enough and without additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s sex,” she told a parent website.
Children need stability and confidence.
Historically, children born with male and female genitalia were called hermaphrodites - by the name of the beautiful Greek god, who had the signs of both sexes.
And only ten years ago, the medical community perceived the gender as a sheet on which you can erase everything, and then paint again.
But now many are challenging the ethical grounds for surgery, knowing that gender identity is complex, and doctors sometimes make an incorrect choice, not knowing how the child will perceive the gender assigned to him when they grow up.
“In the mid-twentieth century, it was called an ‘urgent psychiatric case’,” Dresher said.
When such children were born, you did not call a psychiatrist - you called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to handle intermediate-type children was proposed by Dr. John Mani of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that gender was easy to change.
He coined the term “gender identity” and argued that environmental signals, including social – how parents grow a child—interingers—have interacting with the genes and the child’s hormones, determining whether a person would consider himself a man or a woman.
But in one case of 1966, known as John/John, his theories were in question.
He advised the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged during negligent circumcision, completely castrate the child, removing his testicles, and raising him like a girl.
“Many presented the case as a successful example of a transition, but it wasn’t,” Drecher said.
When the boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy again and married a woman.
But at the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Dresher said some doctors are still “applying this model.”
But in the 1990’s, with the advent of the Internet, people who survived these sex reassignment operations declared themselves “dissatisfied with the result.”
This was the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male XY chromosomes, but intermediate-type genitals.
The doctors could not pinpoint whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis, and were convinced that he would never be able to live a “full life” of a man.
Therefore, shortly after his birth in 1976, the outer genital and testicles of Bruce were surgically removed, and he was raised as a girl.
He began to give female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very difficult to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he was prescribed vaginoplasty.
But being depressed and realizing that something is wrong, he demanded medical documentation.
What he learned was terrible.
I was sterilized at birth, and no one ever told me about it.
Bruce was born with a violation of sexual development, which prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for the normal development of genitals.
After learning the truth, he again became a man, receiving testosterone injections and retracting his breast.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he advocates others in an organization called the Interface Project, trying to normalize the perception of people with intersex.
But Anne Tamart-Matts, executive director of the Californian Law Association Advocates for Informed Choice, is concerned that German law “encourages labeling and stigma.”
“A lot of activists are concerned that German law will encourage parents to make a hasty decision and give the child an ‘uncertain sex’,” she said.
We are afraid that he will facilitate intervention.
We believe that it is better to appropriate the male or female sex, and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law will manifest itself, so all we can do is to make assumptions.
Tamart-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because “it allows adults to make a choice in favor of the third sex.”
“Adult people should be able to make their own decisions about formal sex,” she says.
The German law implies its assignment at birth.
This is a battle that young children should not enter at this stage.
When they grow up, then they will be able to make decisions about their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a male-studiologist-tencologist from Pittsburgh, who has a daughter with impaired sexual development and who helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law “support” both parents and children.
Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but she has a violation of sexual development called “a syndrome of complete insensitivity to androgens.”
Because its androgenic receptors are working incorrectly, Katie developed female signs.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Now, at the age of 29, Katie is married and is being held by child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Despite being barren, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or gestational surrogacy.
“The law gives parents time not to make hasty decisions themselves,” Barats said.
He gives them time to do some tests and understand the situation, as well as a period of time before they write “male” or “female”.
In this case, you are in order - raise the child, love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joy.
We don't have to have an operation that's irreversible.
“It allows children to participate in a solution and eliminates the excitement that drives parents because they don’t feel like they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child will decide what kind of sex he or she is more comfortable with, and that’s great.
This gives children the opportunity to make a decision on their own.
US Secretary of State: intelligence agencies sometimes “go too far” when collecting data
US Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that during the collection of data and wiretaps, the American special services sometimes “came too far”, however, the politician noted that the information about the wiretapping of 70 million people appeared in the media is not true.
I assure you that innocent people did not suffer in this process, but the attempt to collect information was.
Yes, in some cases, this has gone too far and was illegal.
I admit this, as the president admits... and we will make sure that this does not happen in the future,” the Secretary of State said.
Equestrian experts coming to Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award knew that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to appear three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Not even a schoolboy, just a few months before, who had taken his first steps, this baby with his pet, Shetland ponie, lynxed through three rounds, to easily take the main prize, leaving 30 adult rivals far behind.
This inseparable couple – the same growth – has received high marks for appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition, which is held by the Sunnibenk Equestrian Center in the city of Radri near Cardiff.
Coming to the general review against the background of men and women in elegant kitty hats, he shifted his cap on the side and proudly spent in a circle of two-year-old Toffey.
The judges praised Fenton for his not-year-old innate abilities of handling horses.
And Toffey received the highest rating for appearance and character.
Fentonton was given to Toffy for his third birthday in March last year, and since then he has been working with a Scottish pony every day.
His 30-year-old mother, Donna, said, “Fenton and Toffi make up a great duet.”
They had a lot of rivals, but the two left with a gold cup and a rose.
It was just his second performance with Toffey, and we were all excited when he won.
Completely unfamiliar people in the arena considered it so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This boy from the village of Nantiglo, not far from Ebb Weil in South Wales, is in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howels, who has been exposing horses for over 10 years.
Ms. Howels said: “The entire audience was amazed and everyone shouted apportioning and clapped.”
He ran through the sand along the entire length of the arena and, although he looked so tiny, did his job perfectly.
Fentonna is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and farms, and he has two chickens he cares about.
Judging by the way he started, he will soon take part in the “Horse of the Year” – and I am sure that he will perform well.
A spokesperson for this annual equestrian exhibition said: “Fenton is only three years old, but he knows how to handle his pony.”
Together they are a great team.
The referees noted Fenton and Toffy for their appearance and for how they imagined themselves in the show ring.
They assess the coherence of the performance of the ponies and the breeder - Fenton and Toffi were the best in the ring.
I’m sure Fenton was helped by his attractive outfit, he really looked good in his role.
In Altai, a bus overturned.
In the Rubtsovsky district of the Altai Territory overturned the shuttle bus PAZ.
As a result of the accident, according to updated data, 13 people were injured, reported in the regional department of the Ministry of Emergency Situations.
Earlier, law enforcement agencies of the region reported 10 victims.
According to the agency, the accident occurred around 9 a.m. local time on the Novonikolaevka-Vishnevka highway, 1 kilometer from Novonikolaevka.
In the bus en route from Rubtsovsk to Vishnevka, there were 12 passengers and a driver, all received injuries of varying severity and were hospitalized.
Eleven victims were taken to the City Hospital No. 1 of Rubtsovsk, two people were hospitalized in the CRB Rubtsovsk.
The court suspended the execution of the decision on the practice of “stop-and-search” in the New York police Department
On Thursday, the Federal District Court of Appeals suspended the execution of a court order requiring changes to the “stop-and-search” program of the New York Police Department, and removed the judge from the case.
The Court of Appeal of the second district of the United States said that the execution of the decisions of Judge Shira Sheindlin will be suspended until the results of the appeal filed by the city.
In August, the judge ruled that the city had violated the constitution in the way he performed a program for street detention and interrogations.
The city filed an appeal against its decision and regulations on corrective measures, including an order to appoint a controller to help the police station change the practice of work and its related training programme.
On Thursday, the Court of Appeal heard the debate of the parties on the application for suspension of the case.
The Court of Appeals said it was necessary to challenge the judge due to the fact that she violated the code of conduct of US judges and did not consider it necessary to avoid a demonstration of bias, partly because of a series of media interviews and official statements containing a public response to criticism of the court.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people, unfoundedly addressing blacks and Hispanics under the program to stop-and-and-cloating.
She appointed an external controller to oversee large-scale changes that included policy, training and control reforms, and decided to launch a pilot test program for video cameras anchored on the television cameras in those police stations where most of the detentions took place.
In August, New York came to a decision to stop the practice of storing the names and addresses of people who were terminated after a police check.
The debate on the appeal of the city is due to take place after 14 March 2014.
The “stop and search” tactics have been criticized by many civil rights lawyers.
The “stop-search” has been practiced for several decades in one form or another, but the number of documented stops has increased dramatically under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg, reaching an absolute record of 684 330 people in 2011, the majority of whom are black and Latin Americans.
In 2004, four people, all representatives of national minorities, filed a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of the changes in the “stop-and-should” program at the New York Police Department say these changes will put an end to unfair practices, form a more robust and effective police service, and can influence other police departments implementing this practice.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce the morale of the police, not the level of crime, will lead to unnecessary spending money and will not solve the more global problem of difficult conditions in the police due to a decrease in the number of officers by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she does not stop the practice of “stop-and-sealing”, which corresponds to the constitution, but changes the way in which the New York police stop people.
Azarov promised Ukrainians the collapse of prices for goods after the signing of the Association with the European Union
Prime Minister of Ukraine Mykola Azarov is convinced that prices in the country will decrease significantly after the country signs an association agreement with the European Union.
He stated this during communication with readers of his Facebook page.
I can definitely say that prices are determined by a large number of factors, among which there are, among other things, customs payments.
So, after the signing of the agreement and the entry into force of the provision on the Free Trade Zone, the level of customs duties on the import of goods from the EU will significantly decrease.
And this will mean that prices should go down.
"This is about the goods that come from the EU countries," Azarov wrote.
As for other goods, the impact of the agreement on prices will not be so direct, it will be indirect.
But, nevertheless, there should not be an increase in prices either.
Therefore, messages on billboards, which recently appeared a lot in our country, that the association with the EU is an increase in prices, this is not entirely true, or to be more precise, is not so, ”concluded Azarov.
Package of rescue measures in the amount of $ 325 million for health care of Tasmania
The federal government is pushing for a $325 million rescue package for a weakened Tasmanian health care system will be complemented by tight conditions that ensure that the state government will not waste it.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent measures” to prevent a crisis caused by the aging population of this island state, higher levels of chronic disease and system restrictions.
The decision to finance for four years was made after consultations of the government with independent deputy of Tasmania Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue package that we believe will address the specific challenges facing the state,” Ms. Plibersek said today.
A $325 million package includes $31 million for a blitz campaign for planned operations.
Another 2600 operations, including orthopedic and cataract removal operations, will help overcome the backlog.
There is also money for clinics taking patients without pre-registration, in Hobart and Lonsenseton, to improve the quality of post-in-patient care, training of medical professionals, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic medical records systems in local hospitals.
“These investments will go on the follow-up to the best doctors about how best to help the Tasmanian health system,” Ms. Plibersek said.
The minister insisted that the Tasmanian government would work in strict accountability and responsibility.
The state will need to maintain current funding levels in order to receive Commonwealth funds, and report monthly on where he spends these additional funds.
A three-person commission will be established to make sure the staff provides services as efficiently and more efficiently as possible.
Mr. Wilkie said today that $325 million would not solve anything “if they are not followed by a genuine reform that will put Tasmania’s health system on a more sustainable basis.”
However, he praised the Government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first addressed the Prime Minister in early May.
“I hope that the federal aid package will significantly contribute to bringing this state’s health system out of a critical state,” Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional selective procedures largely offset recent cuts.
But Federal opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s statement is a “solution similar to a leukoplastic plate”.
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s Labour government has plucked $430 million from the health care system,” he told ABC TV.
When the state government breaks almost half a billion dollars, and the Commonwealth invests 300 million, you can’t pretend that this is good news.
Mr. Dutton asked Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollar in the rescue package would be spent on an additional bureaucracy.
The Cryscriber of Despair by Obama Voter
I voted for President Obama twice, sharing the hope for a change
He says Obama has allowed the obstructionism of the Republicans to nullify commendable efforts.
Obstructionism cannot justify problems with the website of the reformed Obama health system, drone attacks
Obama campaign memoirs are a sad reminder of what might be
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard University School of Medicine.
I read a terribly sad book these days.
I thought this book would inspire me in times of despondency in the second year of the medical faculty and would revive my sense of hope.
It’s called “Audaness to Win,” and it’s a memoir of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish writing reports on my patients in the evening and going to bed, this book brings me back at a time when politics inspired millions of people and performances could be breathtaking.
The victory in the elections was impressive, and the leading news programs paused to reflect on this historic moment.
My classmates cried out for joy, and my parents took care of all the newspapers they could find.
A young team of strategists was to come to the White House, and the people were ready for change.
During Obama’s inauguration in 2008, his support was 82%.
Then I close the book.
Return to the present is a rough awakening, like a pulling out of the dream.
It is difficult to remember those days of optimism - they seem to be a distant memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I lowered my first ballot, the changes have indeed occurred.
That was something I couldn't even imagine.
I commend Obama for his great and varied achievements, from passing the law on affordable medical care to the withdrawal of our military from Iraq, the repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell,” the murder of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I believe that party obstructionism has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, the possibility of choosing public health care and the closure of the Guantanamo Bay base among others.
But after countless times when I was on the side of the Obama administration, defending it to my colleagues and peers, I ran out of explanations that I can provide.
I have reached a point of political despair.
Obstructionism of Republicans cannot explain permission to wiretb out foreign leaders or drone strikes against innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of Americans by the National Security Agency or the persecution of whistleblowers revealing government misconduct.
He cannot explain the assassination of U.S. citizen Anwar al-Awlaki without trial or non-compliance with state funding and spending limits during presidential campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report, which states that the efforts of the White House to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And recently, he can’t justify the fact that it hasn’t been possible to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of the law on affordable medical care.
I don't know if I should have expected that.
Should I have understood at the age of 18 that management may be contrary to the political campaigns that precede it?
It is clear that working in an elected office is not a predictable program of action, since our public dialogue will be formed by the opposition political party and such random events as the massacre in Newtown.
Nevertheless, all the examples I have listed above shows that they were largely the own choice of the administration.
And that’s what bothers me the most.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was an incomprehensible and rude alternative, it seemed that he was not able to make a decision on his own politics or views.
I believed that in my second term, Obama, freed from the pressure of future elections, would live up to the hopes we have heard about during such a long time.
However, when Obama’s rating dropped below 45% this week, it has become much harder to return to 2008 through this book.
It makes me long for a lot of promises that have evaporated.
This week I read the part of the book that describes how Clinton inflicted a resounding defeat on Obama in the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
At the meeting to analyze the causes of failure, he told his employees that they should return to normal and remain true to their goal.
“I want us to bring back our appeal,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.”
Five years have passed, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment belong exclusively to Nathaniel Morris.
Egypt takes the first free-elect president to be sworn in
Mohamed Morsi is sworn in, but the day of his celebration is unlikely to mark the end of the political struggle in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised “new Egypt” when he was sworn in, becoming the first freely elected president of the country, replacing Hosni Mubarak, who was overthrown 16 months ago.
At his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt after the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago.
He took the oath before 18 judges in black mantles in a courthouse on the banks of the Nile, built in the style of an ancient Egyptian temple.
“We are committed to a better future, the new Egypt and the second republic,” Morsi said during a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom, genuine democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old American-education engineer with a Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that most of its 84 years of existence was a banned organization that targeted the brutal actions of successive governments.
The building was guarded by hundreds of soldiers and policemen as Morsi arrived with a small motorcade shortly after 11 am local time.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered outside the courthouse to welcome the new president, and unlike Mubarak’s presidential pump, the movement was stopped only for a short time to let his convoy through a normally busy road connecting the city center with the southern suburbs.
Although Morsi was ridiculed as a non-charistic “baby wheel” of the Brothers, his personal prestige has grown dramatically since his victory and Friday’s performance, in which he tried to present himself as a candidate not only of Islamists, but also of all those who want to complete the work of the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak.
“Today, Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Morsi, dressed in a blue business suit with a red tie, judges in a wooden panelroom hall where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his inaugural speech.
He was given an official reception with an army orchestra that performed the national anthem, during which he stood on the rack "much".
There was a military leader Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi.
His arrival was met with the slogan “Army and People – One Hand”, which chanted hundreds of those gathered in the main lecture hall of the university.
Founded in 1908 as a stronghold of secular education, Cairo University in the 1970s became a stronghold of Islamist student groups.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, where the uprising was born, which ended the authoritarian rule of Mubarak last year, and promised to return the powers of the president, which his position was deprived of by military council, which took matters from the deposed leader.
But by agreeing to accept an official oath before the court, and not to parliament, as is customary, he fulfills the will of the military, and this is a sign that the struggle for power will continue.
Morsi’s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with theatrical populist gestures.
Schools urged to pay more attention to mathematics, spelling and grammar
School courses of English literature will require students to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and modern British fiction since 1914.
The exam will also feature “out-of-program texts” to encourage more extensive reading.
The combined course of English literature and language will be abolished.
From 2015, students will be required to take a separate final exam in the language, with persistent recommendations for choosing English literature as a separate exam.
The Department of Education is due to release new curricula in English and mathematics tomorrow, the first subjects subjected to radical revisions.
It will make changes to other basic items next year.
The OQUAL exam regulatory body will present a revised partition of the final high school exams, with a new evaluation system and a smaller coursework.
Speaking in the summer, Education Secretary Michael Gove said that “a broad consensus has been reached that we should reform our exam system to regain public confidence,” insisting that school final exams would be “more complex, more ambitious and more stringent.”
Studies show that English schools devote less time to mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours a week for a quarter) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give an average of 143 hours a year, and in Singapore, students study for about 138 hours.
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to the math schedule, coalition sources said that large-scale school math exams, combined with an increased coefficient in the ranking table, would likely serve as an incentive to provide schools with additional training on the subject.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-life-related challenges,” including financial math.
Football is the cause of discord?
In the State Duma, within the framework of the Open Stand, politicians and experts spoke about how to preserve the national peace in Russia.
Among the proposals was this: to ban football in the North Caucasus, because from this game - only scandals and discord.
Speaker Sergei Naryshkin recalled the recent events in Biryulev and said that in order to reduce the “degree of tension in society”, politicians and the media should be correct in the statements.
Probably, he meant the recent scandal with Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who in one of the TV programs threatened to surround the Caucasus with barbed wire, if they do not want to limit the birth rate there ...
All speakers spoke about measures to regulate migration from the CIS countries, and about measures to harmonize relations between the peoples inhabiting Russia, which gave the discussion confusion.
Maxim Grigoriev said that the events in Biryulev are “a model conflict that could be predicted”, but “for these questions we have too many people and instances”, and seven babysitters have a child without an eye.
The concept of multiculturalism, which Europe has long practiced against migrants, according to the public, has failed, and it is necessary to look for its own path.
Historian Yuri Petrov laid great hopes for a new unified history textbook.
“It is still necessary to create a manual on the history of the culture of the peoples of the country so that schoolchildren in Tatarstan know what kind of people live in Dagestan, and vice versa,” he said.
Gennady Zyuganov proposed to introduce criminal liability for “calls for dismembering Russia”: “If in the United States you need to give Alaska to Russia, then you will be arrested and 20 years in prison!”
Vladimir Zhirinovsky tried very hard to "not to incite".
As usual, he blamed journalists who bring the sick and acute national problems to a public discussion: “In the heat of polemics, there is little to say!”
The leader of the faction “United Russia” Vladimir Vasilyev immediately advised journalists to conclude a “charter” and agree to talk on this topic carefully, and then politicians can make the same obligations.
We have adopted about 30 laws that regulate migration, and the order is generally established, said Mr. Vasiliev.
As an example, he cited a law that holds regional and municipal authorities the responsibility for the interethnic peace on their territories.
But Lyudmila Andrichenko did not share the enthusiasm for this law: there is no “clear idea of what the adaptation of migrants, its mechanisms and limits is.
So, the subjects will interpret the amount of these powers in different ways.
In addition, municipalities do not have personnel necessary to solve such complex issues, there are no means, and methodological recommendations that they could use, the center does not give them.
The head of the Duma Committee on Nationalities Affairs, Hajimet Safaraliyev, proposed to create a special department with a formidable name “Ministry of National Security”, which would deal with issues of national policy.
But Valery Tishkov, who in the 90-ies headed a similar department, abolished later, opposed.
It is enough to have a special person at the federal level, a “minister without a portfolio”, which could be addressed if anything.
"We walk along the edge, the shells are tearing side by side, it is very important for representatives of different ethnic groups and religions to oppose provocations together, and this work should receive decent information support," - said the representative of the ROC for Relations with Society Vsevolod Chaplin.
There is no neutrality of the state in relation to dangerous ideologies, including religious, in his opinion.
Then Oleg Nilov put the discussion in an unexpected direction: "More talented people than in Chechnya or Dagestan, it is still necessary to look for, but they are pushed wrong, not on that road," he said.
"Not the road" is the development of football: "Then the football player is beaten with the whole crowd, then the flags are burning, then the comrades throw stones at each other ...
Maybe we don't need football.
There's another sport - rugby is called...
"They will not be equal in this sport in the world!" - he said filthily right-winged.
No one will play in rugby in the Caucasus! - Mr. Zhirinovsky intervened immediately.
You'll offer them more curling!
It is necessary to know the national features, it is like the Georgian "Zaporozhets" to offer ...
In Yaroslavl, wild behavior in the stands distinguished representatives of the Moscow club - during the game with the local club.
Football will have to be banned throughout the country.
National Security Agency Recognizes Corporate Paranoia with Public Surveillance
On a warm day in late August, a German police helicopter flew low over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany.
According to the instructions of the Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German internal intelligence service, its task was to photograph the roof of the US office building, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media say BfV hoped to detect antennas of eavesdropping devices, and these actions led to negotiations between the United States and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, director of U.S. National Intelligence, again assured that the U.S. did not use foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal commercial secrets of foreign companies in the interests of U.S. companies to boost their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, a contract officer who became a whistleblower, has begun to publish his treasury of U.S. intelligence secrets, European governments and company executives are no longer sure to take the director’s word for it.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency monitored the Brazilian oil company Petrobras and gained access to data stored by US cloud service providers, including Google and Yahoo, raised the paranoia of the corporations caused by state surveillance to new heights.
The last straw was the news that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone was tapped, perhaps for about a decade.
If the most influential person in Europe can become a target, then, of course, business leaders are also potential targets.
Snowden has made intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence and companies.
I think it is likely that this data is used with mutual benefit.
“Germany must wake up,” says Oliver Grün, president of BITMi, which represents Germany’s small and medium-sized IT companies.
German companies are convinced that the U.S. now poses almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial espionage and data theft, according to a study published in July by the consulting agency EY.
In all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, however, there has not yet been evidence that the United States has passed on trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians expressed concern that the EU lacks certain opportunities in the field of information technology and the Internet, and expressed the opinion that it should try to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Businessmen are skeptical about this.
Someone in the German parliament says we have to create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and slowly open them again.
“This is not an option,” says Gasso Plattner, president of the German business software company SAP.
If there is a need for a powerful European IT industry, it was not necessary to allow it to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany: from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
And yet, the coverage and technical development of U.S. espionage agencies, which became known by Snowden’s revelations, were shocked by some companies that previously thought that China was the biggest risk of surveillance.
A major shift is taking place in cloud technologies, where European company executives have become better aware that data stored in the U.S. are in the same jurisdiction and are therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a study conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, about 10 percent of its non-American participants have abandoned plans to use the services of a US-based cloud provider after exposing the American program for mastermind data analysis to Prism.
Jim Snaib, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see that consumers are asking a new question that didn’t arise a year ago, namely, where my data is stored and whether you can guarantee that they will physically remain in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders argue that the latest reports are just a confirmation of what they already knew: powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets, and therefore, these data should be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is happening is not surprising.
He's always been there.
“This has been a discussion item for many years and hasn’t changed significantly in the current debate,” says Kurt Bok, chief executive officer of the chemical company BASF.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are spying on them, too, because it is part of our national interests to protect our businesses.
Corporate leaders usually don’t like to brag about the retaliatory measures they have taken, as this can give the enemy advantage.
In large companies, it has long been assimilated by the idea that taking a free flash drive at the exhibition or leaving a laptop unattended in a hotel room is at least imprudent.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the automotive company Audi, says it has been a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before board meetings so they can not be used as an eavesdropping devices.
The Federal Service for the Protection of the Constitution of Germany recommends that company executives consider using simple prepaid mobile phones during foreign trips due to the vulnerability of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are subsequently discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized companies remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many such companies are leaders in the world market in their specific niche.
“Small and medium-sized companies often lack experience, employees and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV report warns.
The U.S. is warning its own companies of economic espionage from other countries.
The U.S. National Intelligence Report in February placed France with Russia and Israel in the second series of violators who are engaged in hacking for economic intelligence, after China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of the prestigious German company confirmed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst of all.”
Bernard Skarsini, former head of the French internal intelligence agency DCRI, reportedly said in an interview this month: “Services are well aware that all countries, even when they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, spy on their allies.”
Los Angeles International Airport was evacuated due to shooting at one of the terminals.
An unknown man opened fire in the third terminal at 09.30 local time on Friday, November 1 (20.30 MSK).
The guards evacuated employees and passengers of the second and third terminals.
According to preliminary data, the man fired a high-power rifle.
Several people, including a U.S. Transportation Security Officer, were injured.
Police opened fire and detained the attacker.
He's easily hurt.
Tripody denies that it is influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labor Secretary Joe Tripodi will be involved in the investigation of the state’s anti-corruption oversight body.
Former New South Wales Secretary Joe Tripodi refutes changes in the procedure for renting seaside objects at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who secretly owned shares in three real estate objects on state land.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation of whether Mr. Obeid lobbied for several state ministers to extend leases for Serkyullar Ki, where the Obeid family owns two restaurants and cafes, without passing the tender after their expiration in August 2005.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid’s secret involvement in the properties of the property, after the testimony given by the former deputy head of the administration, Mr. Tripody Lynn Ashpool, on Thursday.
During several years of discussions that began in 2005, the government insisted that the lease be put up for an open competition.
The tenants were against it, and also wanted longer terms.
In 2009, lease agreements for enterprises for Serkyular Ki, which brought the Obed family about $ 2.5 million a year, were extended without an open competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was the Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially advocated open competitions.
But he denied that the changes had been made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi acknowledged, strongly advised changes to the government's lease policies.
The ICAC transcript of the telephone conversations provided conversations in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the Ports Ministry after working under Mr. Obeid in the Fisheries Division.
“Was there a question discussed in these telephone conversations, the development of commercial lease policies?” Mr. Tripody, Assistant Commissioner Anthony Willie, asked.
“No,” Mr. Tripodi replied. –
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was definitely not.
Definitely not between me and Mr. Obeid.
UN Announces New Goals to Overcome Poverty
The United Nations must immediately begin work on a new set of challenges to replace the Millennium Development Goals, which had been formulated 12 years ago to overcome poverty around the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in advancing the “settlement of sustainable development” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015, before the UN summit on sustainable development that began in Rio de Janeiro the night before.
They were included in the final version of the document, which will be signed by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the summit yesterday that it is time to “be above national interests.”
“I am pleased that the UN member states have agreed to launch and take control of the process of creating universal sustainable development goals,” he said.
These SDGs will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals, they will become an integral part of the concept of development for the post-2015 period.
I will make every effort to exercise the powers provided to me by member countries to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the successful implementation of the MDGs.
In utilities payments of Voronezh residents there will be a new line of costs - deductions for major repairs of the house.
According to the most approximate calculations for a standard two-room apartment from the new year will have to pay from 100 to 400 rubles per month.
The exact standard will be determined by the government of the region.
But when to paint the entrance, put in order the stairwells or even replace the elevator - the tenants themselves will decide.
This law was approved by the deputies of the regional Duma.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, Chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, noted: "In this case, it is also necessary to restore order - to establish the order of overhaul of houses, accumulate funds not in the management companies - which we often register in Moscow, then in Orenburg, then somewhere, it will be the establishment of state control over the expenditure of funds that residents collect for the repair of apartment buildings."
Under the control of the state now and shared construction.
The law protecting against fraudsters is approved by the regional Duma in the final reading.
The document was not born out of an empty place.
In our region, 4.5 thousand people were affected by dishonest developers.
The problems of the majority were solved.
By the way, the new law prescribes rights and obligations for all participants in shared construction.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "It is no secret that in this area, also began to abuse, associated with the fact that in the 98 th year the co-investors got the same, and in the 2000-ies the same co-investors."
People began to make money on this to cover the loophole, including those adopted these two laws.
Under Voronezh, it was decided to build a temporary stay center for foreign citizens to be deported.
The regional parliament passed such a law not only under the pressure of the federation.
Problems associated with illegal migrants in the region at least get rid of it.
So, last year, a little more than 100 thousand foreigners got on the migration register.
But only one in five issued an official work permit.
Where others work and whether they pay taxes is a big question.
Vladimir Klyuchnikov, chairman of the Voronezh Regional Duma, said: "They violated the law, but are not criminals."
There is no court, but it is necessary to deport - they must be kept somewhere.
This decision was made by the Federation that at the expense of regional funds to equip such places.
In the Voronezh region, such a place is determined - this is Staraya Olshanka of the Semiluki district.
Well, in the end, the regional parliament has endowed new benefits for large parents.
Firstly, families where 5 or more children are raised completely exempt from transport tax.
The budget in this case loses 3.5 million - but the same is saved by large parents.
Secondly, and this is the main thing, those who will adopt 3 or more children, from the new year will be issued subsidies for housing.
For each member of the family, the new law provides for 18 square meters, at a price of 30 thousand per meter.
The family, for example, of 6 people - dad, mother, child and 3 - adopted.
For them, according to the standards, the state buys housing with an area of 108 square meters - for 3 million 300 thousand rubles.
For the left bank or the South-Western microdistrict - quite an acceptable option.
Well, in the district center for this amount you can already buy a whole cottage.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Releases Recommendations for School Allergies in Children
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a list of recommendations for the control of food allergies in children in schools.
This is the first list of similar recommendations that the U.S. government has issued, while the number of school-old children suffering from food allergies is growing.
Now one in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the prevalence of food allergies among children increased by 18 percent from 1997 to 2007.
The manual provides information to schools on how to raise awareness among teachers and service personnel about food allergies in children and how to help in the event of an allergic reaction.
It also recommends that schools keep adrenaline reserves — most often used for injections, an automatic medical syringe EpiPen – to help with potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently amended the regulations to allow schools to stockpile adrenaline with less difficulty.
The notification also contains a list of typical symptoms described by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, “It feels like something is poking in my tongue,” “the feeling I have hair on my tongue” or “tiengerion language.”
Kenyan press outraged by provocative media law
“This is a terrible place, and there are grounds for the question: what can the Parliament not allow the destruction of the independence of the judicial system in the future?” the newspaper said, calling the law unconstitutional.
“This law is very harsh and punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, managing director of Capital Group’s parent company CapitalFM, which includes one of Kenya’s most respected independent radio stations and a news site.
He said the new media judiciary “will always be biased because it is a continuation of the government,” and restrictions on content and advertising would harm Kenya’s position in the global economy.
“I hope that the president will listen to us, and we appeal to him with a request to reject this bill and return it to the deputies,” he said.
According to The Star, the new law will essentially allow the government to “take the media with a dead grip”, and The Standard reported that democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya “have suffered a serious blow”, and criticized the bill as “draconian”.
The adoption of the bill is part of the measures taken to enhance national security after the September attack of Muslim terrorists at the Westgate shopping center.
Kenyan media angered the authorities, broadcasting surveillance footage records where the troops that were sent to the scene of the attack are allegedly robbing an expensive shopping mall.
The reaction of police chief David Kimayo was the call of two journalists and media officials for questioning, although the call was canceled after mass media protests.
Under the new law, publishers can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings, and individual journalists - up to one million with an additional risk of being "excluded from lists", that is, to obtain a ban on obtaining official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to confiscate the property of the offender, if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “even one fine is enough to paralyze the work of most FM radio stations.”
She also said that these measures can have a devastating effect on Kenya’s so-called “wively blogosphere.”
Politicians understand that by forcing the media to silence, they will be able to do everything they want with impunity.
“No one ever knows,” Nation journalist Mutu, Matthew, described the Kenyan media as a key source of deterrent and balancing forces in public life.
“The politicians provided to themselves will ruin the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Kenyan legislators were the target of public anger in the past.
In May, they voted to cancel the cuts imposed by the national wage commission and the restoration of their huge salary, amounting to about 532 thousand shillings per month, tax-free, one of the highest in the world.
Investigators check information about child abuse in Biysk
On October 29, the media published a message that the teacher of one of the kindergartens of the city of BIysk for educational purposes locked the child in the basement.
Currently, investigators find out all the circumstances, as well as give legal assessment of the actions of kindergarten staff.
After the accusation of bad taste Evgenia Vasilyeva spoke
Evgenia Vasilyeva, to whom the media has been attracted for almost a year of personal attention, has never commented on numerous publications in the press about embezzlement in the Ministry of Defense, and about her personally - relations with ex-Minister of Defense Anatoly Serdyukov, her poetry and about the addiction to valuable things.
However, on November 1, the defendant in the case of "Oboronservis" broke the silence.
In an interview with Life News, Vasilyeva said: “Initially, of course, the task was exactly one: to get any negative information from me against the former Minister of Defense.”
There was blackmail on the fact that I should testify, otherwise I will be put in jail.
To date, these threats have ceased.
Then we go to court, we will prove our innocence.
We are 100 percent sure of the victory.
At the same time, from the interview, we can conclude that, perhaps, Vasilyev was most touched by words that she does not taste well.
Probably, we mean the statement of the official representative of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation Vladimir Markin that the collection of paintings, which was collected by the defendant in the case of Oboronservis, fakes were found.
Among the arrested property there are a number of paintings that the hostess, being confident in her deep knowledge of art, acquired as masterpieces of world painting.
However, the art expertise appointed by the investigators after the arrest of these paintings found that they have no artistic value and, simply put, are cheap forgeries,” Markin said in early October.
Some paintings stolen from the Ministry of Defense...
Then they admitted that they were not stolen from the Ministry of Defense, while they said that I had bad taste.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, discuss some personal moments?
In my opinion, it is just lawlessness,” says Vasilyeva.
At the same time, when asked if she admits her guilt at least in one of the 12 criminal episodes imputed to her, Vasilyeva said: “Naturally, no.
There's nothing to admit.
Moreover, there is no damage to the Russian Federation in question.
Just misleading people, that's all.
In addition, in response to today's statement of the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation that Vasilyeva evades studying the materials of the criminal case, the defendant's lawyer said that he and his client "the investigator does not give acquainted with the materials of the case."
What was the reason for the revelations of Vasilyeva, who is still not communicating with the press?
Perhaps, how did she not be able to answer the accusation of poor taste?
Or are the journalists of Komsomolka who claimed a couple of days ago that she “fell into even more trance under house arrest” because of the news of the reconciliation of Anatoly Serdyukov with his wife and his return to the family’s run.
Famous military observer "KP" Viktor Baranets in his article "Serdyukov returned to his wife?" He wrote: "Investigators do not rule out that after such a shock it can become more talkative during interrogations."
Earlier, Vasilyeva took on some accusations of illegal sale of real estate by the Ministry of Defense.
Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci will not help the team in the next match of the Italian championship with Parma.
According to Football Italia, the coaching staff decided not to include him in the application for the game to save before the match of the 4-th round of the group round of the Champions League with Real Madrid.
Also, they will not take part in the fight with Parma Lichtsteiner, Vucinich and Pepe.
And forward Fabio Quagliarella recovered from injury and is ready to play.
The UK government announced a study aimed at increasing the economic impact for Scotland from the HS2 railway project.
The HS2 project envisages the opening of high-speed communication with Scotland and the north of England, with the beginning of the First Stage in 2026
Baroness Kramer’s Transport Minister noted that the project will “unite the UK”.
Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “in pursuit” of working on a plan with the UK government.
The first phase will be to build a new high-speed railway line between London and West Midlands.
When the second phase is completed, the lines will be laid in Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has instructed HS2 Ltd to consider further improvements in the railway capacity and reduce the duration of travel for Northern England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to overcome the path from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London in three hours or less.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal of HS2 is to create a truly national network that will make the UK and its cities closer to each other.”
We develop HS2 because the benefits it will bring are huge.
Without it, we will face a capacity crisis in our railway network.
But we are also talking about the transport connection of cities with each other; throughout the UK, 18 cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will receive the best message thanks to HS2.
Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
On behalf of the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to “definitely” support the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-speed rail has every chance of bringing huge economic benefits to Scotland, but also adds Scotland’s economic weight to the overall argument for high-speed rail throughout the UK.”
Therefore, we are excited to work in partnership with the UK government to consider options for building a high-speed railway in Scotland, creating benefits for all and continuing the Glasgow-Edinger railway line, which the Scottish government is already planning.
I look forward to reviewing the results of the British ministers ' research next year and the joint decision on the next steps.
U.S. Cut Food Supply to the Poor
Food allowance for a family of four is reduced by $ 36 per month
Since Friday, the financial support of food stamps, known as the food stamps, is declining in the United States, as the corresponding state program ends.
For the food allowance, a family of four will now be allocated $ 36 per month less than before, officials say.
This will affect 47 million of the poorest Americans.
According to Reuters, in the 2012 fiscal year, the allowance per person averaged $ 133 per month.
Food aid spending in the U.S. rose to $80 billion a year due to rising unemployment and food prices.
Approximately 14% of Americans rely on free food aid issued on “foodsteps” bearing the name since they had the form of paper coupons.
When the current economic crisis began, the program was expanded to spur economic growth and help the poorest Americans.
However, Republicans in Congress are demanding further cuts for the program, claiming that it should be aimed at helping those who need it more than others.
Owners of grocery stores across America worry that cuts will lead to lower consumer spending.
U.S. congressmen continue to argue about how much capacity it is possible to reduce government funding.
Due to the new rules introduced by Russian customs, hundreds of trucks have been in line on the border with Russia in the queue.
Today, Donetsk officials promised to provide drivers with drinking water and install toilets
Hundreds of trucks accumulated in border points at the entrance to Russia.
This situation arose due to a change in the rules of customs clearance of goods.
Ukrainian border guards and customs officers confirm: the queue is creating a Russian side, which did not warn in advance about innovations.
Since October 28, the customs authorities of Russia began to apply additional measures to guarantee the delivery of goods, - said Deputy Head of the Eastern Customs office Vladimir Denisov.
The new model document applies in countries that have acceded to the Convention on International Transport.
Checkpoints operate in an enhanced mode.
The correspondent of “FACTS” visited the border and talked with truckers who found themselves hostages of the situation.
Prices in the roadside shop-cafe at the checkpoint "Novoazovsk" are growing every day, as well as the queue of trucks.
Trucks stand in several rows, stretching for about two kilometers.
The customs terminal Novoazovsk - Veselo-Voznesenka provides one of the most important transport directions from the south of Ukraine on the international highway.
From here, the goods are sent to the Stavropol Territory of Russia, Kazakhstan, Georgia, Armenia.
On Sunday, until midnight, they were still allowed, and then these rules were introduced, - complains trucker Alexei Golovanev (pictured), who carries cargo from Turkey from Turkey to Kazakhstan in transit through Russia and has been sleeping in his car for almost a week.
Under the new rules, to cross the border, I need an additional package of documents and payment for cargo insurance.
The amount depends on the cost of the cargo and the distance it is carried.
The minimum insurance is 4.5-5 thousand rubles (about 1100−1300 hryvnia).
Those who go near (say, to Georgia, Armenia) with a cargo worth up to 50 thousand dollars, pay somewhere 15 thousand rubles (3800 hryvnia) and pass.
And the rest are stuck - after all, no one has such a big money with them!
Imagine, if the driver carries cargo in the amount of only four thousand dollars, but as much as in Moscow, he needs 90 thousand rubles (almost 23 thousand hryvnia) to pay for transit!
Conditions for survival on the border - no - complain truckers, who got along near their cars.
In border shops and cafes and already expensive, but such prices as here, we have not met anywhere!
The sellers were guided and quickly screwed them: 15 hryvnias are a loaf, seven hryvnias - a cup of coffee, 25 hryvnia - a plate of soup.
And the cafe is one.
There's no toilet.
We sleep in the steppe, we go to the toilet.
No washing, not shave...
I can't get out of the car for a week, my wife's on the road.
I will last a week, - another trucker consolidates himself Viktor Skotarenko.
Will it be my car's turn in a week?
Why do you have one and a half liters of water? - interested in the only border shop.
There are 11 and 15 hryvnias.
What, the bottle is crystal or the water is infused on silver?
We have a cafe, not a shop.
Take it while there is something else, - the saleswoman retorts.
After the situation began to be covered in the media, the authorities of the region drew attention to the plight of Ukrainian drivers.
The leadership of the Amvrosiyev and Novoazovskaya district state administrations were instructed to provide everyone who is idle in the queue on the Ukrainian-Russian border with drinking water, - said the acting chairman of the Donetsk regional state administration Sergey Dergunov.
Now ambulance brigades are on duty at checkpoints.
Biotoilets will also be installed for the convenience of people.
According to the official, the problem associated with the queues will be solved in the coming days.
According to the press service of the Donetsk regional state administration, as of October 31, 32 and 68 cars were idle in the international checkpoints Uspenka and Novoazovsk.
"FACTS" will monitor the situation.
Sony expects lower annual profit
Japanese electronics manufacturer, Sony, ending the last quarter with a net loss of 19.3 billion yen, or $ 197 million, reduced its forecast for profit for the current fiscal year.
Sony's results for July to September 2013 were more depressing than expected, due to a drop in demand for televisions, video cameras and personal computers manufactured by a Japanese corporation.
Sony’s television business, which brought the company’s first operating profit of 5.2 billion yen in three years, in the reporting period again fell to 9.3 billion yen of operating loss.
The Japanese market of consumer electronics is going through difficult times, especially due to lower demand for televisions.
And while competitors are eager to look for a way out of a difficult situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer segment.
For example, one of Sony’s main rivals, Panasonic Corporation, has recently shifted the focus to industrial components: here, the company’s sales are growing at a high rate, especially due to automotive systems and environmentally friendly technologies.
As a result, by the end of the fiscal year, which will end in March 2014, Sony expects to receive 179 billion yen of operating profit against the previously expected 230 billion yen.
At the same time, according to Thomson Reuters, analysts assumed that this figure would be much higher and will amount to 221 billion yen.
In an effort to get out of the crisis, Sony is expanding its product line.
In the middle of this month, the start of sales of “smart” watches from the Japanese corporation, endowed with a number of fashionable functions, was announced, which will allow you to get the need to get a smartphone 100 times a day.
After Sony lowered its annual profit and revenue forecast, the company’s shares in the morning at the opening of the torog in Tokyo lost in price more than 11%, falling to the level of 1668 yen per share.
How much do the late celebrities earn - MK in the USA MK
The ranking of live celebrities with the highest income in 2013 was headed by Madonna, who earned $ 125 million.
But it was “overwhelms” by the late Michael Jackson, whose posthumous income from October 2012 to October 2013 was 160 million.
Noticeably behind him are other celebrities who have passed away, who last year “earned” several times less.
The second in the list of the most "healthy" departed celebrities, compiled by Forbes magazine at the end of the year was Elvis Presley - 55 million for the year, and the line below the author of the Peanuts comics Charles Schultz with 37 million.
In addition to them, the top five included Elizabeth Taylor, who was the leader last year (25 million), and musician Bob Marley (18 million).
The list also included Marilyn Monroe, John Lennon and Albert Einstein.
Eser proposes to equate extremism an insult to patriotic feelings
To legislatively defend the patriotic feelings of citizens from provocations and insults directed against Russia, “Fair Russia” proposes to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and punish for this five years in prison.
According to the newspaper "Izvestia", such amendments to the legislation, prepared by the deputy chairman of the Duma Committee on energy Oleg Mikheev, have already been sent to obtain an opinion in the Supreme Court and the government.
By patriotic feelings of citizens, the author of the amendments proposes to understand the emotional connection of a person with the country of which he is a citizen, characterized by love for this country, responsible attitude to its fate, respect for its history and culture.
As Mikheev points out, domestic legislation has sanctions for abuse of formal signs of state power - the flag and coat of arms.
At the same time, according to the parliamentarian, the protection of Russians, whose feelings can be affected by the insult of state symbols, and other manifestations of disrespect for our country, in Russian legislation is not sufficiently worked out.
As an example, he cites the discussions unfolding every year on Victory Day, when some media persons allow themselves to question the heroic feat of the people of the USSR in the fight against the fascists.
On the eve of the main national holiday - Victory Day on May 9 - a real bacchanalia unfolds annually.
Exercised in wit and “alternative view” of history, some publicists reach the arguments that, they say, it is a pity that the cultural Germans did not conquer the Wild Soviet Union!
I consider this absolutely unacceptable in a country where pride in history remains the main “spiritual bond” of the nation,” Oleg Mikheev resents.
In addition, according to Mikheev, patriotic people in Russia are much more than religious, but the law punishes insulting the feelings of believers, and you can insult patriotic feelings with almost impunity.
According to the MP, it is necessary to equate the insult of patriotic feelings to extremist activity and prescribe the corresponding punishment in Article 282 of the Criminal Code.
The bill provides for punishment for insulting patriotic feelings: from a 100-thousand fine to 5 years in prison.
In the new compositions of public monitoring commissions will increase the influence of jailers
Today, the Council of the Public Chamber (OP) can approve new compositions of public supervisory commissions (POC) in 43 regions of Russia.
If the option put to the vote is adopted, the security policy lobbyists will increase their influence.
POC - public structures that control the conditions of detention in places of deprivation of liberty.
The affairs of Sergei Magnitsky and Leonid Razvozzhaev, the excitement in the Kopeyskaya colony - it is through the POC that most of the resonant incidents are resolved behind bars.
For control over the POC is a struggle between human rights defenders and security lobbyists.
At the meeting of the OP working group on the formation of the PNC, I proposed to make the selection criterion the experience of human rights activities.
“It was not accepted, and formed the lists without developing the criteria,” says Valery Borshchev.
Borshchev is the current chairman of the Moscow Supervisory Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the All-Russian structure of human rights defenders dealing with prison problems.
When he was a deputy of the State Duma from Yabloko, he developed a law regulating the activities of the POC.
The OP Council is due to vote for the composition of the POC in 43 regions of the country.
For 1800 vacant places claim less than a thousand people, and in Ingushetia and Kabardino-Balkaria, competitions could not be organized due to the lack of candidates.
OP promises to organize an additional set for vacant seats.
The POC of Moscow is one of the few commissions with the competition, despite the fact that the new composition will be 40 participants instead of 20.
According to Borshchev, in the current composition of the capital commission, 11 human rights defenders and 9 security forces, and in the version, which is on the vote in the OP, the ratio changes by 17 to 23.
At the same time, 30 human rights defenders wanted to get into the Moscow commission.
But the new composition may be re-entered by a representative of the "Combat Brotherhood" Vyacheslav Kalinin.
He was a member of the POC for three years, but never visited the prisoners.
Borshchev believes that the security forces, having appointed their chairman of the POC, will be able to make the work of human rights defenders unbearable, so human rights activists do not exclude a collective withdrawal from the commission.
In their opinion, the advance of the security forces is coordinated by the POC member Anton Tsvetkov, who heads the "Officers of Russia" - an organization that defends the interests of law enforcement agencies.
“I don’t eat babies for the head,” Anton Tsvetkov told RBC daily.
He denies lobbying for the promotion of any lists and says he is not going to prevent human rights defenders from visiting the arrested opposition.
According to Tsvetkov, he was not even interested in what list they are now voting in the OP.
He considers the publication of Borscheven information a form of pressure.
The possible success of human rights defenders is the planned change of leadership of the Chelyabinsk POC.
Its former leaders will be suspended because of last year’s Chipa race.
The Public Chamber came to the conclusion that the leadership of the local commission ignored the problems of prisoners.
But the PMC of Rostov-on-Don can move from human rights defenders to security forces.
From the new lists “disappeared” human rights activist-chairman of the local commission, but one of his opponents was “disappeared”, despite the fact that in May 2013 the Federal Public Chamber ruled him for unethical behavior.
Lists of the Moscow and Rostov commissions Borshchev considers "a revenge for Kopeysk".
The revelations of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova did not affect the PNC of Mordovia, which is considered a “power”: only one human rights activist wanted to get into the new composition, and she did not even accept the documents for the competition.
OP Council member Nikolai Svanidze told RBC daily that he voted against the proposed list, as he is outraged by the situation in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don.
He sent out his position to other members of the council.
His colleague in the OP Pavel Gusev says that he voted for, as he likes the proposed Moscow list.
Coordinated the compilation of lists of the PNC Deputy Secretary of the OP Vladislav Grib, who is also an employee of the Research Institute of the Federal Penitentiary Service.
Mushroom told RBC daily that he does not consider it correct to divide candidates into human rights defenders and security forces and does not agree that the chairmen of the commissions have enough authority to interfere with the work of its members.
The mushroom is not to predict the results of the vote of the OP board.
If the proposed list is rejected today, an amended version will be put to a vote in the coming days.
Clive Palmer claims that Deputy Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in the issue of parental leave.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest on parental leave because his daughters can get pregnant and benefited from it.
This mining tycoon, which has an unresolved $6 million-only carbon tax dispute, made the announcement at a time when he was trying to dismiss the questions about whether it had a conflict.
The Palmer United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which may be crucial in deciding on the abolition of carbon taxes and mining.
But Mr. Palmer argued that the conflict of interest could only be ministers and said that Mr. Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from policy measures.
“He has a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if any of these daughters get pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether they will receive a vacation or not,” said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the election commission officially declared Mr. Palmer a winner in the struggle for a seat from the Sunshein Costa constituency of Fairfax as a margin of 53 votes after recounting the votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the electoral counting procedure to speed up the process.
Daughters Tony Abbott Francis and Bridget.
Should the decision on this election be made two months after we voted?
“We need to have a better system,” he said.
Why should we not have to have such a system so that you can come, enter your data into the computer, immediately vote and get the result at 18:30 on the same evening?
Mr. Palmer also criticized the use of pencils for ballots.
Is it because they can erase the result if someone doesn’t like it?
Using a pencil in our time seems strange.
The Electoral Commission is studying the possibilities for electronic voting and recently published a joint discussion paper with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59, said his program included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and would be “very serious” about his new job.
Public office involves serving society.
“We are not seeking any rewards other than the gratitude of history, for the fact that at a critical moment we can serve this district,” he said.
Against Google, Samsung, Huawei filed lawsuits on Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, filed a series of patent lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers, including Google, the price of which it interrupted at the Nortel bankruptcy auction.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, filed lawsuits to infringe on patent rights to the U.S. District Court in Texas against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
These patents cover technologies that help match search keywords on the Internet with their respective advertising, the lawsuit says, which is the basis of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were unavailable and did not comment.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones running on Google’s Android operating system, which competes fiercely with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google offered a final price of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google has raised the proposed price several times, eventually offering as much as $4.4 billion.
After losing the Nortel patent case to the Rockstar consortium, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, the Motorola patent library was the majority factor in this transaction.
“Despite the failed attempt to buy patents at auction that are the subject of a lawsuit, Google has violated and continues to violate them,” the lawsuit says.
Rockstar demands increased damages from Google, as it argues that the infringement of patent rights by Google is intentional, according to the claim.
The stadium in Yaroslavl is not ready to receive 22 thousand spectators, police officers who were present today at the meeting of the RFU CDC.
The ticket program is overestimated, in their opinion, about twice.
During the match of the 1/16 finals of the Cup of Russia with Spartak, only a thousand stewards were involved in the regular rate of nine thousand.
Spartak fans were entitled to 2200 seats, that is, 10 percent of the capacity of the stadium, however, by agreement with the Moscow club, they were sold 5 thousand tickets.
This data was announced by the head of the CDC Artur Grigoryants.
The bird, air-engraved with a rig, delivered back into the wild
The bird, thrown over the air on the shore after being found in a depleted state of oil on the North Sea oil was released back into the wild.
This water shepherd was placed in a helicopter bound for Aberdeen last month, and then it was released by the Scottish Department of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) at the rescue center in Alloa.
The center manager, Colin Seddon, said: “This water shepherd is most likely a winter migrant from Nordic, who fell into a zone of strong winds over the North Sea.”
It seems that the bird was exhausted and was able to find refuge on the oil tower.
He added: “She was unable to take off again, so we were asked for help.”
The water shepherd was healthy and in good condition by the time he was released.
Fines for unauthorized street trade in Vologda will grow significantly
According to the city authorities, the increase in the size of fines will help to restore order in Vologda and free the streets from spontaneous tents and trays.
Most street vendors do not pay taxes, the products they sell often do not pass appropriate sanitary control.
And this means that the health of the Vologda is endangered.
So, the lower limit of the fine for citizens for unauthorized trade from November will increase six times - from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, the press service of the Vologda Administration reports.
In September, 600 people were fired from the Ford automobile plant in Vsevolozhsk.
As they say in the trade unions, all the dismissed received compensation.
However, much sharper than the problems of workers is the question of reducing industrial production in the region.
Deputy of the regional ZakS Alexei Etmanov at the meeting said that at the plant of the company "Ford" in Vsevolozhsk reduced about 600 people.
According to him, this happened in September: then, according to the voluntary dismissal program, which was developed together with the union of the organization, about 600 people left the plant.
Workers who decided to resign of their own free will were offered “golden parachutes” in the amount of several salaries.
Because of this, the vast majority left jobs of their own free will.
However, according to Etmanov, such a number of people is a whole night shift.
I don't think that's gonna be limited to that.
However, the authorities in the next two years do not plan to take any programs to support regional enterprises in a difficult situation, ”he explained, adding that when adopting the budget, the government does not take into account the stagnation of production in the region and a large reduction in jobs.
In the "Ford" this information is not denied and not confirmed.
We are waiting for a response from the company, and as soon as it appears, we will definitely publish it.
Talk about the reduction of workers at the Ford plant in Vsevolozhsk have been going on for a long time.
For example, the company’s plans to dismiss 600 people became known in September.
Earlier, the plant announced the suspension of the production of cars.
As a reason at the plant called the fall in demand for cars "Ford" in Russia.
According to Petrostat, according to the results of nine months of 2013, the volume of industrial production in the Leningrad region decreased by 5.4%.
Production of vehicles and equipment decreased by 11.5%.
Dmitry Medvedev: the growth rate of GDP of the Russian Federation is insufficient for the development of the state
Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev considers the growth rate of its GDP insufficient for the Russian Federation and is confident that the situation can be improved by simplifying the conditions for lending to business and changing the structure of the Russian economy, focusing on innovations, reports Reuters.
We planned this year’s GDP growth in the region of 3%, maybe even a little more.
It will actually be a little less than 2%.
Against the background of the recession in a number of European countries, it seems not very bad, but for us this is not enough, because the economic base is not as powerful as in a number of countries, and in general, in order to develop, there must be higher rates.
Now it is very important that Russian companies, Russian business receive normal loans at a normal price - this is the first thing that must be done," the head of government stressed.
Director of Ugra Andrey Belmach noted that it is difficult to say how long it will take to find a new head coach.
This post became vacant after the resignation of Sergei Shepelev.
The resignation occurred only a few hours ago, so to say how long it will take to search for a new coach, I am not ready, ”Itar-TASS quotes Belmach.
Maybe it's day.
Maybe a month.
We are studying all possible options.
Priority will be given to the Russian specialist.
I don’t just want to find a coach, but someone who will work in our club for several years and will achieve certain results with him.
Snowboarder for the Olympic bill specially photographed
The Bank of Russia on Wednesday issued a commemorative banknote dedicated to the city of Sochi, where the Olympic Games will be held this winter.
The denomination of the bill is 100 rubles.
But in the network bloggers are already actively ironic about the commemorative banknote.
After the presentation of the Olympic bill on October 30, they drew attention to the fact that the image of the snowboarder from the banknote can be found in photo banks.
In particular, in the free storage photo StockExchange, where this photo is dated 2005.
The same photo is used in the Photoshop lesson published on the Russian website "Megazor" on January 18, 2011.
In addition, it has already been used in advertising smartphones RugGear.
The Olympic banknote is made in a blue-blue range.
On the one hand, a snowboarder flying over Sochi is depicted, on the other - the view of the Olympic stadium and the Firebird.
The author of the banknote design is Pavel Bushuev, who won the competition among students of the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts named after Repin.
At the presentation, it was noted that several sports were considered - ski, freestyle and ski jumping, but in the end they chose a snowboard, since it is a relatively young sport.
According to the source of “Izvestia”, close to the Central Bank, the regulator does not care about the opinion of the public about the wide distribution of the image of the snowboarder from the Olympic banknote and is now studying the situation.
But in Goznak are not too concerned about the hype around the Olympic banknote.
The head of the press service of the state sign Natalia Nikiforova told “Izvestia” that all the reasoning about plagiarism is ridiculous.
Snowboarder on the banknote will turn to the right, in the photos in the network - to the left, - said Nikiforova.
A person at a photo shoot to create a bill was filmed from different points, then the final image was chosen, on it - a characteristic posture of a snowboarder.
She also noted that copyright laws do not apply to the Olympic banknote, as the artist received a salary for work.
According to experts, the discussion around the image on the Olympic bill is completely positive.
The recognition of the image on the bill is a plus for its promotion, - said the executive director of NP "USBrend" Alexey Popovichev.
It is quite difficult to prove the one hundred percent similarity of images on the banknote and in photo banks, so it is unlikely to take lawsuits to challenge the intellectual property of this image.
The first Olympic banknote appeared in China - a 10-yuan commemorative banknote was issued for the Beijing Olympics in 2008.
Russia has decided to support this tradition.

The NSA blames the “inner error” rather than hackers of stopping the site
Filled with a secret National Security Agency said on Friday night that the shutdown of their website for several hours caused a technical failure, not hackers, as stated in the network.
“NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours this evening due to an internal error that occurred during the scheduled update,” the intelligence agency said in an official email.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Claims that the interruption in the work was caused by a distributed “dismissal of service” attack [DDoS” is incorrect.
Earlier this evening, online server monitoring systems recorded that the NSA website did not work for at least six hours, and the site is still unavailable to some users.
Earlier, a representative of the NSA told ABC News that the internal secret network of the agency “not” was hacked.
No classified information is in danger, the representative said.
At least one online group of hackers-activists said it is responsible for disabling the NSA website using a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to overwhelm the target site with traffic until the servers are overloaded and the site fails.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and attacks are not designed to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
Previously, the ultra-secret NSA, once nicknamed “No Such Agency,” was in recent months in the spotlight of public attention and fierce criticism after a series of revelations about its extensive surveillance programs abroad and domestically – all the reaction to the secret NSA files stolen from the agency and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy around the agency has sparked talk that today’s incident was the result of targeted hackers.
The head of Gazprom Alexey Miller says that the pipeline in Bulgaria marks a new era in the gas sector
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the head of Gazprom said.
“Today there was a landmark event: the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, began,” Gazprom Chairman Alexey Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is designed to diversify Russia’s export routes through Europe.
The dispute under the contract between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which contains most of Russia’s gas intended for Europe, increases the risk level for conventional routes, officials say.
Miller said that a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries have been eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at a reduced price as soon as the entire project starts working in 2015.
Gazprom said that the construction should begin in other countries further along the gas pipeline route by the end of the year.
The pipeline’s annual project capacity is 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Rosbalt agency stripped of media status for obscene swearing
On October 31, the Moscow City Court decided to invalidate the license to register the Rosbalt agency.
On the deprivation of the agency’s status of the media insisted on Roskomnadzor – for systematic and gross violations of the law on the media.
During the trial, an unpleasant precedent was created: the court considered it possible to close the media, actually denying the publication the right to put forward counter-arguments.
What is "Rosbalt"
CJSC "Information Agency Rosbalt" was established in St. Petersburg in 2000.
In the following years, the agency opened a second head office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
The agency also has offices in the countries of the former USSR.
Since 2001, Rosbalt has developed and functioned as a federal information and analytical agency.
By the mid-2000's, the agency was included in the list of the most recognizable private Internet media in Russia.
At the same time, Rosbalt has always occupied a rather specific niche: the core of the exclusive publications of the agency was (and still make up) notes with reference to sources in law enforcement agencies.
Talks about the proximity of the publication to the power structures continued throughout the existence of the agency.
Along with the fact that Rosbalt had an extensive base of sources in various departments, in favor of such assumptions, the fact that Natalia Chaplin, the wife of Viktor Cherkesov, was at the head of the project.
At the same time, Chaplina’s role in the leadership of Rosbalt is not fully clear: it is most often called the “head of the project”.
The general director of the agency is Larisa Afonina, the editor-in-chief is Nikolai Ulyanov.
Recently, Rosbalt has not appeared in the ratings of the federal media - neither in terms of citation or audience.
In October, the agency took 25-th place in the rating of attendance of sites of Russian media according to LiveInternet.
According to the same LiveInternet, the average daily audience of the site rosbalt.ru is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and up to 500 thousand views), monthly - about three million unique visitors.
Among the most popular materials in the last five months are notes about the Kremlin’s helplessness in relations with Ukraine, the death of the soloist of the group “King and jester”, pogroms in the capital Biryulev.
The conflict between Rosbalt and Roskomnadzor began in July 2013, when amendments to the law on the media came into force, which prohibited journalists from obscene swearing.
The department found prohibited vocabulary in two videos published on the agency’s website (“Jigit from Krasnodar” and “Pussy Riot desecrated oil flours”).
The other parties describe differently.
Roskomnadzor on the basis of the detected video materials accused Rosbalt of a gross and systematic violation of the law on the media and appealed to the court with a demand to take away the license from the agency.
In “Rosbalt” stated that the claims of the department are illegal: firstly, the videos were not editorial materials, and secondly, the cloth words in them were disguised, and, thirdly, immediately after the warning, the videos were removed from the site.
Representatives of the agency appealed against the claims of Roskomnadzor in the magistrate court - and when on October 22, 2013 the Moscow City Court accepted the claim of Roskomnadzor, the consideration of these complaints still continued.
However, already on 25 magistrate, the judge made a decision not in favor of Rosbalt: the editor-in-chief Nikolai Ulyanov was found guilty of violating the code of administrative offenses and fined 20 thousand rubles - 10 thousand for each video.
Obviously, this predetermined the outcome of the hearing in the Moscow City Court - if you give up the idea that the outcome could have been predetermined even earlier.
On October 31, the court decided to invalidate the certificate of registration of Rosbalt, effectively depriving the agency of media status.
It cannot be said that Rosbalt remained alone in the course of this confrontation.
The Agency was supported by deputies of the State Duma (the statement addressed to the head of Roskomnadzor Alexander Zharov on October 10 was signed by 26 deputies; the document itself was filed at the initiative of the Communist Party).
The illegality of the closure of the publication was stated by the head of the Union of Journalists of Russia Vsevolod Bogdanov, the Chairman of the Moscow Union of Journalists Pavel Gusev and the head of the presidential Council for human rights Mikhail Fedotov.
Moreover, according to Bogdanov, the leadership of Roskomnadzor even provided him with some guarantees that it would not come to the revocation of the license.
The trial of Rosbalt showed that under whose jurisdiction it is safer to be the media in Russia today is a big question.
The gene of speech turned out to be a stimulant for the formation of synapses
Scientists from Johns Hopkins University and Mount Sinai Medical School have discovered a protein through which the “speech gene” Foxp2 performs its function, stimulating the formation of new connections between neurons.
The study is published in Science, on the website of the journal you can read its brief content.
The Foxp2 gene is the first known gene whose function is directly related to speech.
It was possible to establish its role in 2001 thanks to the discovery of a family of several people who could not correctly pronounce words and sometimes even did not even understand each other.
Scientists have found that the family members had the work of the Foxp2 gene, but how it performs its function remained unknown.
In a new study, biologists have shown that at least some of their functions, Foxp2 performs as a stimulant for the formation of new synapses in the brain associated with speech formation.
It does this thanks to another gene, SRPX2.
The latter was discovered as a result of finding factors that stimulate the formation of synapses.
SRPX2 was one of 10 similar genes found by the authors, while only on its activity is Foxp2.
The fact that SRPX2 does influence vocalization, scientists have confirmed in the experiment on mice.
When in animals, the activity of the gene was artificially reduced, they shouted less when separated from the mother.
If the activity of the gene was restored, the frequency of sounds produced was also restored.
Previously, the mice also showed a connection with the vocalization of Foxp2 itself.
Animals that were injected with a human copy of the gene were squeaked more actively and at a lower frequency than ordinary mice.
Until now, however, scientists do not know whether the work of Foxp2 and, accordingly, the SRPX2 controlled by it is connected with purely “mechanical” properties of sound formation or more subtle processes.
Ponomarev left "Fair Russia"
Deputy of the State Duma from the party “Fair Russia”, a member of its branch in Novosibirsk Ilya Ponomarev filed an application for withdrawal from the political organization.
According to the parliamentarian, he submitted the statement to the Novosibirsk regional branch of the party.
According to its charter, this automatically means that Ponomarev left the ranks of the “just Russians”.
We sit, we drink tea...
“For some reason, many want to see the picture “Ilya Ponomarev puts a party ticket on the table”, but there is nothing so epochal in this,” the deputy commented on his decision.
Ponomarev noted that he maintains good relations with the regional branch of the “SRs”.
Meanwhile, from the mandate of the Deputy of the state Duma Ilya Ponomarev does not intend to refuse.
He explained that, despite leaving the party, he remains a member of the faction and by law can not leave it.
Reports of Ilya Ponomarev’s intention to leave the party “Fair Russia” appeared on October 30.
It was reported that Dmitry Gudkov and Valery Zubov will leave the “SR” with him, but the latter soon denied this information.
Do you want ice cream glowing in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has created the world's first ice cream in the dark with a jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of a marine animal to develop glowing food.
He came to this idea, reading a scientific article about the mazus, and convinced scientists in China to chemically recreate the glowing protein.
Ice cream reacts with the language of the one who eats it, raising the pH level in the protein and forcing it to glow.
Chris says that as ice cream begins to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, it means that the more you lick, the more bright it becomes.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company, Leasy of Me, I Am Delicious, says, “It’s an incredible thing, but still at the very beginning, if we talk about production, so for £200 you’ll get about 2 g of the substance.”
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue with a neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms the protein, it will increase pH levels and the ice cream will begin to glow.
We have been testing it for the last few months, and it seemed that it would be ideal to present it to Halloween because it creates such a wonderful luminous effect.
This is perhaps the most expensive ice cream I did because the luminescence of the jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
So every balloon costs me about £140.
It tastes pretty nice.
Charlie’s experimental company, located in Bristol, is famous for its unusual flavors, including beer, cheese, beef and the taste of gold leaf.
But his next creation should be even more ambitious.
He said, “I really want to develop an invisible ice cream.”
This is by definition impossible because of the refractiveum caused by ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I think we will find a way to do it.
Ice cream uses fluorescent properties of jellyfish, synthesized by Chinese scientists
GM recalls a number of new pickups in the U.S. to refine seat backs
General Motors Co recalls almost 19 thousand completely new Chevrolet Silverado pickups and the 2014 Sierra GMC model to address problems with manual adjustment of seat backrest tilt, according to a notice from U.S. regulators in the field of vehicle safety.
On some of the pickups, the front seats may have a defect in the tilt mechanism of the backs.
As a result, the back of the seats does not meet the federal standards of motor vehicle safety by head restraint.
“When hitting the car at the back of the head restraint, the head restraint may not properly protect the driver and passengers by increasing the risk of injury,” the notification is posted on the website of the National Highway Administration.
The models were manufactured in the period from August 1 to September 10.
The production of GM pickup trucks began in June and represents the most important launch of the car into mass production for the leading American automaker since its restructuring due to bankruptcy in 2009.
GM told the owners of the pickup trucks about the defect in the first half of October.
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration could not consider notifying owners due to a 16-day government shutdown, which reduced car sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were upgraded for the 2014 model range, rose about 20 percent during the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16 503 pickupa Sierra.
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon rose 1.4 percent to $37.47.
In the area of the Tretyakov Gallery opened a pedestrian zone
A new pedestrian zone has appeared in Moscow.
It is located in the area of the Tretyakov Gallery and occupies a section of two kilometers from the metro station "Novokuznetskaya" to Bolotnaya Square.

Snowden is ready to “cooperate” with Germany on U.S. intelligence
Edward Snowden, a U.S. intelligence whistleblower, said he was ready to go to Berlin to testify to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander could not answer questions about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Strösbele met with Mr. Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum to discuss his testimony in Germany.
A letter from Mr. Snowden, which the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, said: “Although the result of my efforts was clearly positive, my government continues to treat dissent as treason and seeks to criminalize political statements with criminal accusations that do not give any defense.”
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In a letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed that the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to renounce criminal charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is willing to talk to German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany became tense after allegations that the NSA was tapped by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Opperman, a deputy who heads a parliamentary group in charge of the intelligence service, said that if it is possible to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting him in danger and not destroying relations with the United States completely,” it must be used.
Mr. Sröbele, a member of parliament from the Greens of Germany, posted his photo with Mr. Snowden on his Twitter.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Strebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former NSA contractor, Mr. Snowden could not have returned to Russia if he had left.
If Mr. Snowden testified in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe” there.
Mr. Snowden said in a letter that he had faced a “hard and permanent” campaign of persecution that forced him to leave his home.
However, he said he was encouraged by the global reaction to “his political remarks.”
Citizens around the world, as well as high-ranking officials — including in the United States — have found the exposure of an uncontrolled system of pervasive surveillance useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be resolved.”
Foreign workers on Class 457 visas can be tested for “authenticity”
The “authenticy” test for foreign workers by Class 457 visas is under consideration by the government as it outlines the expansion of repressive measures.
This test, if adopted, will be applied according to criteria aimed at preventing the use of class 457 visas to fill unskilled posts or as a loophole to move family and friends to Australia.
The paper presented by the government for discussion was published today, while former Labour MP Maxine McQue criticized the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“Varic statements such as “foreigners – at the end of the queue” and “at first the work of Australians” are a very unpleasant rollback to the times when the unions demanded a protected labor market,” she told the Australian-India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that white labor had to be protected—and if some in the region saw echoes of this historical artifact, I wouldn’t be surprised.
The document presented for discussion sets out 12 measures that were previously considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O’Connor, who was yesterday in Sri Lanka, where he meets with officials over human smuggling, has already made five of the recommended changes, and the rest are under consideration.
If the criteria for “auternity” are accepted, the applicant for a visa can be examined for whether the candidate is genuine under conditions where the candidate is a relative or close friend of the owner or a person related to the financing of the enterprise.”
Enterprises may also be required to report on the number of owners of sub-cells of the 457, since before the enterprises that intended to sponsor a small number of employees, then took to work hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan seeking asylum, died presumably of a heart attack after arriving on a boat with refugees on Christmas Island this week.
The grief-strong nine-year-old son of the man accompanied him on his way to Australia, and since his father died on Wednesday he was supported by a cousin who was also on board.
The Australian authorities hastily sent the man to a hospital on Christmas Island, where he died.
The head coach of “Colorado” Patrick Roua, explaining the decision to release goalkeeper Semyon Varlamov from the first minutes in the Friday match with “Dallas”, expressed confidence that recently night behind bars did not shake his confidence in the Russian, reports from Dallas sobkor “SE” Natalia Shmelev.
And what we can expect, - said Rua after the morning rolling "Lavin".
Of course, what happened bothers us all, but we are confident in it and feel that it will be useful for him to go out on the ice today.
We want him to go out on the ice and show his usual level.
That is, you are completely sure that the situation did not affect the condition of the goalkeeper?
We'll see today.
Undoubtedly, our players will support Varley by helping him protect the goal, as it was in previous matches of this season.
Most importantly, no one in the team is going to draw any conclusions until the court is dealt with in this situation.
Baumgertner nominated to Uralkali’s board of directors
The current Board of Directors of OJSC Uralkali proposed the candidacy of the general director Vladislav Baumgertner arrested in Minsk in a new composition of the board, according to the website of the Russian company.
Bagugertner was included in the list of 11 people nominated for the new board of directors.
This list was prepared for the extraordinary meeting of shareholders on November 29, which will determine the new composition of the Board of Directors by voting.
Baumgertner is currently under house arrest in Minsk.
During his detention in August of this year, he was charged with abuse of office.
However, later the President of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko at a press conference said that the accusations of Baumgertner were reclassified to “theft”.
The EU is preparing a measure to support Ukraine in case of economic pressure from Russia
The European Union has a reserve plan to provide Ukraine with gas, as well as to reach an agreement with the IMF on an emergency loan, if Russia takes any action in response to the possible signing of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement at the Vilnius Summit.
Negotiations are underway with the IMF on a stand-by loan, and another EU official directly involved in the negotiations added that their goal is to conclude an agreement in the near future.
At the same time, in addition to a potential loan from the IMF, Ukraine can receive 610 million euros from the European Union itself.
Analysts polled by Reuters doubt that Ukraine and the IMF are able to overcome long-standing disagreements about the terms of financing.
He does not believe in the possibility of reforms necessary to receive assistance, and the international rating agency S&P, which lowered Ukraine’s sovereign rating by one notch on Friday to B- with B.
However, EU representatives say that the IMF can show flexibility in the conditions of lending, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the plan of financial support for the country, the EU has a reserve option for providing Ukraine with gas, the vast majority of the supply of which is now coming from Russia.
Perhaps it will be gas from the “Nord stream” or reverse from Slovakia.
The latter, according to officials, is the most possible and acceptable way if Russia “isolates” Ukraine.
Analysts believe that this method of reverse deliveries to Ukraine can only be used for a few weeks, and is likely to lead to a decrease in supplies to other regions.
“Negotiations are being held between EU countries and Ukrainians on how to create favorable conditions for Ukraine to import gas from other sources, and not from Russia, or from the same source, but on other routes,” the source added.

Americans have eavesded Japanese high-ranking officials
On Friday, November 1, one of the representatives of the American intelligence, who preferred not to disclose his name, said that the United States was eavesdropping on telephone conversations of high-ranking officials of Japan.
This man confirmed that in the country of the rising sun there are several points designed to listen.
At the same time, he noted that the United States, Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand do not conduct intelligence activities against each other.
According to him, this was the case during the Second World War, when these countries were allies.
But Japan, like Germany, despite allied relations with the Americans in the post-war period, are objects for intelligence activities, NHK reported.
Officially, neither side has commented on this information.
We will remind, the news about the surveillance of the US special services for the Chancellor of Germany appeared last week.
According to German journalists, the NSA could have tapped Merkel’s phone for the past ten years.
The chancellor herself, according to some reports, took the news of her wiretapping very painfully.
She said that the allies, in her opinion, are Germany and the United States for decades, such observation of the head of government is unacceptable.
Meanwhile, Edward Snowden said he was ready to share details about the wiretapping of Angela Merkel’s phone conversations with the German prosecutor’s office.
The German specially flew to Moscow to meet a former CIA officer.
Scandalous video hit the police
The head of Toronto, Rob Ford, known for his scandalous and frankly reckless antics, fell on the smoking of crack.
The police of the Canadian city said that they have the appropriate video and are ready to start an investigation against the mayor.
He said he would not leave his post, CNN reported.
The information that the authorities have evidence of drug use by Rob Ford appeared on the website of the police of Toronto.
The head of local law enforcement, Bill Blair, held a press conference on this matter.
The sheriff said that he is not authorized to share these personnel with the public, but for their existence he vouchs.
According to Blair, the commating video of Rob Ford was detected during an anti-drug raid conducted by the guards in the summer of 2013.
Previously, the Canadian press wrote about the existence of this video, but until recently there was no evidence.
The mayor himself does not comment on this.
He only says that it is not his fault and is not going to resign.
The video discovered by the police is one of the evidence in the case of Ford’s 35-year-old friend Alexander Lisi, who is accused of trading light drugs, extortion, receiving illegal income, and criminal conspiracy.
Sometimes Foxe served as Rob Ford driver.
Residents of the city have long demanded the resignation of their mayor.
He repeatedly fought with journalists, appeared in public in a drunken state, allowed himself racist and sexist statements.
Diana Arbenina celebrates Halloween with her children
Diana Arbenina does not hide how much pleasure she receives from the upbringing of her children.
Despite the fact that now Arbenina gives especially a lot of time to creativity and social activities, she still finds the opportunity to bother with Marta and Artem, and not only spends time on their training, but also entertains as much as he can.
Over the past week, Diana has twice reported to her fans about her pedagogical talents.
First, she posted a photo on Facebook that shows how she teaches children to read.
And yesterday pampered the fans, showing how dressed Artem and Martha on Halloween.
Ready for broom racing! our first halloween" - so called Diana a photo of her children dressed in festive costumes.
Which is not surprising, because they, like no other Russian boys and girls, are related to this holiday, since they were born in America.
An earthquake of magnitude 6.6 occurred on Thursday, October 31, near the city of Kokimbo in central Chile, reports Reuters.
The earthquake was in the ocean at a depth of 10.7 kilometers and at a distance of 54 kilometers south-west of the city, according to the website of the US Geological Survey (USGS).
The tremors were recorded at 20:03 local time (3:03 on November 1 in Moscow).
The victims or the destruction caused by the tremors have not yet been reported.
Recall that Chile is located in one of the most seismically active areas of the Earth, so earthquakes of various forces there are not uncommon.
One of the most serious things happened in 2010.
Then an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 and the tsunami caused by him led to the death of more than 550 people in Chile and the destruction of 220 thousand buildings.
In addition, in Chile, the most powerful earthquake in recent history occurred: in 1960, a magnitude of 9.5.
As a result of that natural disaster, more than five thousand people died.
Rostovia-Ainvest recognized the German company Assmann Bereten + Planen as the winner of the tender for the selection of the general projector of the object.
The amount of the contract in Rostovaeroinvest is not disclosed.
According to the press service of OJSC, nine Russian and foreign companies participated in the competition, according to the terms of the tender, the project should be prepared and sent for state examination in the spring of 2014.
The winner will have to design a new passenger terminal of the airport, as well as infrastructure facilities, internal roads and elements of improvement of the airport complex.
At the first stage of construction, the internal area of the terminal will be 50 thousand. Q. m, in the future it may be increased.
According to Rostovaeroinvest, the project documentation will take into account the prospects for the development of the airport complex: by 2025, the terminal will be able to serve about 5 million passengers, and by 2035 - 6 million passengers.
By the time of summing up the tender, the architectural concept of the Yuzhny terminal complex was determined, which was developed by the British company Twelve Architects.
The project of the main terminal building embodies the idea of an air bridge between Rostov-on-Don and other cities of the world.
Assmann Belaten + Planen has experience in implementing large projects, the company designed terminals C and E of the Sheremetyevo International Airport and the new airport complex at the Knevichi International Airport in Vladivostok.
The Yuzhny International Airport Complex will be built in the Aksai district of the Rostov region and will replace the existing Rostov airport, which will be closed and in the future integrated into urban development.
The construction of the airport complex is scheduled for 2014, the introduction of all facilities for 2017.
Italian workers with experience give way to the young
Italian unemployment is breaking records.
The data published on Wednesday showed that 12.5% of the country’s residents are now out of work.
This has not been so bad since the Second World War.
Among young people, this figure is several times higher.
40.4% of residents aged 15 to 24 are unemployed.
In the opinion of the Italian authorities, one of the solutions to this problem is early retirement of elderly workers.
Such an experiment is already conducted by the largest energy company in the country, and the adopted laws allow regional authorities to provide part of the early pension for employees with experience.
However, on the other hand, Italy is waiting for the common problem for Europe of the ageing population.
And economists are not sure that the idea of premature rotation of personnel will justify themselves.
Syria Destroy Chemical Weapons Equipment
Syria has destroyed all the claimed capacity for the production of chemical weapons, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has recognized.
This first stage of disarmament was completed by Damascus a day before the deadline.
Until November 1, Syria was supposed to destroy production and other auxiliary facilities designed to prepare war-fed poisonous substances for use.
The destruction of the pollutants themselves or their chemical components must be completed by mid-2014.
According to the representative of the OPCW, currently the poisonous substances are in sealed storage.
International inspectors went to Syria after more than 1400 people were killed on the outskirts of Damascus on August 21 during a chemical attack.
The main task of the inspectors was not to waste time - to prevent the Syrian authorities from producing more chemical weapons - and to destroy the infrastructure for mixing chemicals and equipping ammunition.
These production facilities will now be closely monitored to prevent their repair.
The next milestone is mid-November: by this time, the OPCW and the Syrians must agree on a detailed plan for the destruction of existing toxic substances.
There are many questions here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide the equipment for this?
All Syrian statements will be thoroughly verified by the Western intelligence services.
They will readily advise inspectors with new facilities to check if they suspect that Damascus is not completely frank.
The United States believes that this shelling was carried out by regular troops.
Syria and Russia insist that this is the work of the Syrian rebels.
The international community demanded that the Syrian leadership - in accordance with the agreement reached with the mediation of Russia - to destroy or bring to non-working state all the power for the production of shells, poisonous gases and liquids and to fill shells with these substances.
Now that this phase has been passed, the next step should be the destruction of the existing chemical weapons of the Syrian army.
It is assumed that in this arsenal there may be more than 1000 tons of nerve-paralytic poisonous substances, skin-gull-boiled mustard gas and other prohibited chemicals stored in several dozen different places.
To destroy it, it is necessary that the OPCW and the Syrian authorities first agree on a timetable of action - it is given two weeks.
OPCW field chief Gerry Smith told the BBC that his inspectors “personally watched the destruction of the equipment.”
“They now do not have the opportunity to conduct further production or mixing chemical weapons,” he said.
In a statement, the OPCW said that the inspectors visited 21 of the 23 facilities in Syria and were convinced that the plants for the production of shells and poisonous substances were either destroyed or unusable.
The remaining two facilities are too dangerous to conduct an inspection there, the document says, but the equipment from there was transported and checked by OPCW specialists.
According to Smith, the process of destroying the infrastructure for the production of chemical weapons was “especially difficult”, as it was necessary to work in the context of the ongoing conflict.
In early October, the OPCW received the Nobel Peace Prize, but, according to Smith, there was no time to celebrate this at the inspectors - they were too busy with work.
George Kerevan: the gap with Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland will have to join the pan-European zone of free movement as a condition for EU membership.
There is a turn of stories about passport control in Berwick and the border with barbed wire along the Hadrian shaft.
True, the Strathclyde newspaper pointed to the possible economic benefits of freer movements across the rest of Europe, although – what is predictable – it did not appear in the headlines.
Nor did anyone point out that EU member states spend a lot of time turning their formal rules in a way that is convenient for them.
Since Scotland is not now part of the Schengen area, the continuation of non-compliance will be a cheap concession for Brussels to replace what he really wanted from the Scots.
So it's not a noteworthy story.
And so old that it turned into a fossil: for the first time I heard the “duck” that “independence means passport control”, at least 40 years ago.
And yet there is an interesting moment, lost when retelling an old fairy tale.
Why should an independent Scotland carry out European orders?
Why change the yoke of London to the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real European news: the great post-war plan to unite Europe has finally stalled.
With the European crisis, the project “Europe” is officially dead.
Throughout the European Union, parties opposed to the EU or for the abolition of the euro as a single currency are gaining strength.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic party “Alternative for Germany” – founded only this year – emerged from nowhere and received almost five million votes in the September federal elections, thus essentially displacing the “Free Democrats” (an analogue of our “Liberal Democrats”) from the Bundestag.
There has always been an internal opposition to the plan for the creation of a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a turning point.
The austerity measures imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank and the fetuits imposed on national economies through the preservation of the single currency led many people to think that the project “Europe” has gone too far.
The euro crisis is little due to the fact that national governments work with excessive budget deficits, this was true only for Greece.
In fact, the Eurosystem has blocked its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – which German politicians want to preserve.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, southern Europe is at a predetermined position on production capabilities in comparison with Germany.
The only salvage tool is to cut wages and public spending, which is actively supported by Berlin.
Behind the current problems of the budget and currency is a deeper problem of Europe’s productive abilities.
As a result of the green energy package implemented by Brussels, a cipher that means subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer, the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gas as in the United States.
These are paralysingly unfavorable price conditions, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
No wage freeze in the world will stop the crushing victory of the cheap US shale gas over the European petrochemical industry.
As a result, a riot is brewing, especially in France, the ardent self-supporting EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on the same level as Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a means of obtaining political legitimacy, and has already imposed its own economic policy on Europe, leaving the destroyed French economy in distress.
The result is the right-wing, anti-EU party Marine Le Pen’s National Front party just won the decisive by-elections, dropring the ruling party of socialists to third place.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote – a timely warning to British Labourists that it cannot be assumed that the split among the right will automatically affect the left.
What makes Le Pen with his newfound popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the EU elections next year to create a bloc in the European Parliament against the EU and against a single currency.
If – and this is very likely – parties opposed to the EU will receive support in this election, such a bloc will be able to take a dominant position in the European Parliament for the first time.
Here is my opinion: soon the growing mood against the EU and against the single currency in Europe will merge together to destroy the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will again become something like a vague “Europe (sovereign) nations,” which was liked by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several dependent economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will recover their own currencies.
I assume that the UK is distancing itself from this project, hoping to get closer to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington’s growing interest in the Pacific indicates the likelihood that the UK will be left unheated in the cold of the Atlantic.
In what position does Scotland leave this?
We can choose to become a region (in fact) of Malaya England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which means, among other things, to send Berlin and Brussels to hell.
I suspect that Scotland will be able to succeed in a freer European agreement, provided that we keep its currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries will be easier in non-Federal Europe.
Otherwise, we should consider repeting Norway’s experience and preserving our economic independence.
The Scottish National Party’s government in Scotland is, oddly the most successful political movement in Europe, directed against austerity measures that received an impressive majority of votes in 2011, by objections to the cost cuts proposed (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor of the Treasury, Alesher Darling, and subsequently formed by the Tory coalition and the Liberal Democrats.
It would now be ridiculous for voting for independence only to take austerity measures imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Australian Woman Files Appeals Against Prison Term in Thailand
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney, sentenced to 15 days in prison on Phuket Island for false claiming that she was attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty on June 15 by the Phuket Provincial Court of Justice after reporting to the Thai police that a local taxi driver had attacked on Sunday night on June 10, while two other men held her.
However, according to the recordings of confidence cameras later revealed that she returned safely to her hotel after ruptured relations with her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to fabricating the story.
Before the trial, she was held in local police cameras.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a general prison center on the outskirts of Phuketa, not a women's adult prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian League player Peter Tanks, who appealed to the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tanks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “extremely concerned” about the well-being of their daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“Obviously, it was anxious time, but we hope she will return home safely as soon as possible,” Tanks said.
Bamford appealed her sentence and was released on bail of 50 000 baht.
According to reports in Australia, she currently spends her vacation in the resort area of Krabi in southern Thailand.
Law sources in Thailand reported that Bamford is currently a local lawyer in Phuket, but warned that the appeal could lead to the court increasing her sentence for up to two years and forced her to serve a sentence in adult prison.
However, after the recent assassination of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also seek to restore its undermined tourist image, which will lead to acquittal.

Driving schools will be able to conduct exams for obtaining a driver's license
Examinations for driving licenses will be able to take private companies that have their own computerized circuit.
About it writes “Kommersant” with reference to the draft government resolution “On admission to driving”.
According to the newspaper, currently in Russia there are only about 30 such circuits.
It is assumed that students of such “privileged” driving schools will count the results of internal testing.
At the same time, the State Traffic Inspectorate will monitor the exams every six months.
If it turns out that more than 30% of the exams on theory and more than 20% of the site students do not pass the first time, such a school will be deprived of privileges for six months.
The technical requirements for circuits contained in the draft government resolution come into force on November 5, 2014.
The project also contains requirements for driving two-wheeled equipment.
Since January 1, 2015. owners of motorcycles to obtain category A rights will have to pass the exam in urban traffic.
In addition, from May 5, 2014. Companies will not be able to employ foreign drivers with foreign rights.
Such workers will have to receive Russian rights after passing the exam.
Early puberty: aging earlier
African-American and Latin American girls tend to reach puberty before their white peers show research.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is close
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are to blame
Experts believe that the epidemic of obesity can be one of the triggers of early puberty
The tendency to early puberty is not so pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Eterij is a journalist specializing in children's health and family issues.
Should mother be frightened if her daughter begins to form breast rudiments and pubic hair grow at 7 or 8 years old?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Caplovitz explained that these early physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – it usually doesn’t mean a quick onset of total puberty,” Caplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, pubic and axillary hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight shift in the age of menarche (first menstruation) over the past four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years and decreased compared to 12.75 in 1970.
“After breasts begin to develop, it goes away at least two to three years before menarche,” said Caplovitz, also author of “Early puberty in girls: how to cope with this common problem.”
Time is the most accurate checking of how puberty will progress.
There is a discussion about what is the actual onset of sexual maturity, but is considered “premature” when breast augmentation is accompanied by a sharp increase in height to 8 years.
In most cases, the process will slow down or pause – this is something that a pediatrician can track closely.
Faster progression can serve as a basis for tests in an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems, such as tumors or cysts.
There are procedures to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone aging, which can ultimately lead to slower growth and low growth in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child, the level of development, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplovitz is careful with medications, but admits that “suppression of puberty can mitigate the behavioral problems and sensations of girls that they are different from their peers.”
Another big problem is clear: parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
“They’re worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they handle hygiene,” Caplovitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls one woman whose daughters began at the age of 10.
Although there were signs and we talked about menstruation, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from school frightened and frustrated because she was the first among her friends.
There are many advertised theories about the causes of early puberty.
However, there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual media messages are to blame.
In boys - as in girls - puberty occurs earlier.
Caplovitz argues that the premise that has the most weight is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study of girls from 6 to 9 years old, which links the amount of fat in the body with the timing of puberty.
Other data confirm this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-American and Latino girls tend to reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
There are different explanations.
Worldwide, early puberty seems to be affected by everything from economic conditions and climate to genes.
Another mystery: although in boys, hair on the face and pubesis appear at a younger age, the tendency to complete early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference have confirmed the complexity of this topic.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is found even in infants and children of tooth age.
“We need to be careful about how we determine the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Gorieb Children’s Hospital in G. Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to receive instructions from a pediatrician about how to talk to their child.
“This could mean an earlier conversation than expected,” Caplovitz explained.
If you stay calm, your child will usually react well.
Girls who bloom early, need confirmation that even when it happens before, this process is a normal part of life.
The head of Dagestan heard in the anthem of Kuban a note of extremism
The football match between Anzhi and Kuban resulted in a political conflict between the authorities of the Krasnodar Territory and Dagestan after the fans burned the Dagestan flag, and the Kuban anthem sounded differently.
The head of Dagestan Ramazan Abdulatipov on Thursday invited Republican parliamentarians to go to court, because the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory allegedly gives calls for ethnic hatred, in particular, calls for war with “basurman”.
Take the anthem of the Krasnodar Territory, this year in 1995 approved this anthem.
It's a disgrace, and no one's doing it.
"We remember you here as a mother of the native, on the enemy, on the Basurmanin we are going to the death fight" - for what such words write down in the anthem, poison some believers on other believers," Prime Minister Hizri Shikhsaidov expressed solidarity with Abdulatipov.
RBS removes two currency traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has temporarily suspended two traders in its currency trading division, according to two people familiar with the situation, which is another confirmation that regulators’ global verification of alleged manipulations in the foreign exchange market is rapidly gaining momentum.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are collaborating with regulators in investigations related to the world’s largest financial market, whose daily turnover is $5.3 trillion.
These two traders will be the first employees of RBS, suspended in the course of the unfolding investigation, which echoes the scandal associated with the manipulation of the interbank LIBOR rate.
By refusing to comment on the suspension, the bank confirmed that this month it received requests for information from regulators.
“Our ongoing investigation into this issue is ongoing, and we are fully cooperating with FCA and our other regulators,” the bank said in a statement two weeks ago.
Last month, informed individuals said that RBS had handed over emails and instant messages that his former trader, the UK’s regulatory agency, the Financial Control Office (FCA) received and sent.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is known to him given his current position as head of European Spot Currency Trading in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, went on vacation this week, while Matt Gardiner, a former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended from working by Standard Chartered bank this week.
None of these traders were accused of any violations.
Mr. Usher’s group of contacts included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, according to informed individuals.
UBS reported this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating alleged manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
At least six regulators in the world – the European Commission, Finma, Switzerland’s antitrust body Weko, FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority — are considering allegations that bankers have come into a conspiracy to influence the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also began internal audits or received requests for information from regulators, the individuals familiar with the situation said.
Banks view instant messages and emails for several years in search of cases of offenses.
News of the audits has been axed by traders in the field of activity, which in recent years has been one of the largest sources of income of the trade divisions of investment banks, which this year, however, faced difficulties due to the fact that low volatility of currencies reduces favorable opportunities for resellers.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the gravity of the situation, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid currency market, but older traders say that this is not always true.
According to the senior trader, despite the huge volume of daily trading in the foreign exchange market, the fragmentation of liquidity between different trading platforms and the wider use of banks of their internal platforms means that “you can start to influence the market at a very low price.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had fired one of the London Stock Exchange traders this week after causing nearly $6 million in losses late last year.
The bank immediately notified the relevant authorities and cooperates with its regulators.
“We are confident that the trader acted alone and that this issue was localized,” Credit Suisse said.

The lawsuit to block the bill was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The law was strongly opposed by each of the main Republican presidential candidates during the 2012 primary election season, including alleged candidate Mitt Romney.

Venezuela will set a exchange rate for tourists
Venezuela will introduce a special exchange rate of its national currency - the bolivar - against the dollar for tourists.
This was reported on November 1 by Bloomberg, citing a government decree.
Foreign travelers will be allowed to exchange amounts equivalent to ten thousand US dollars per year.
Venezuela will also allow tourists to sell up to 25 percent of the acquired bolivars at the time of departure.
The specific rate of the bolivar against the dollar will be set later.
In February, Caracas was forced to devalue the local currency to 6.3 bolivar per dollar.
However, on the black market, one dollar is estimated at 57 bolivars.
Since the beginning of the year, the bolivar has lost almost 70 percent of its value.
In September, inflation in Venezuela was almost 50 percent.
Oil minister and Economics Minister Rafael Ramirez said on October 18 that Venezuela has no plans to devalue the bolivar.
According to unofficial information that the agency cited, Caracas may still decide to depreciate the national currency after the municipal elections in December.
The policy of restraining prices for products and consumer goods, as well as the high degree of overregulation of the Venezuelan economy, led to a shortage of a number of goods and the functioning of the black currency market.
In the spring of this year, the media wrote that in Venezuela there was a lack of toilet paper.
John Kerry says U.S. espionage has gone inappropriately far away
John Kerry has demonstrated a relaxation of the tactics of protecting U.S. surveillance programs, making an unprecedented admission that in some cases U.S. espionage has “got inappropriately far.”
The Secretary also acknowledged that he was guilty, along with Barack Obama, of having been “on autopilot” during the appearance of Edward Snowden’s high-profile revelations about the NSA’s spy activities.
These information leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic scandal with its allies.
Speaking via video link at an open government conference in London, Mr. Kerry said: “There is no doubt that the president and I, as well as other members of the government, actually took some of the things happening on autopilot, because such an opportunity already existed – both during World War II and in the very difficult years of the Cold War, and, of course, 9/11.”
He was then the first senior U.S. government member to admit that U.S. spying had gone too far, but stressed that no one had been violated.
He said, “In some cases it has gone far.
And the president is determined to shed light on this issue and explain himself to people, and now conducts a thorough analysis so that no one has a feeling of abuse.
I assure you, there is no abuse of innocent people in this process.”
Mr. Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA had acted for good intentions and that his surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are willing to blow themselves up.
There is a radical extremism in the world, reckless and determined to kill people, to blow people up and attack governments.
And if you were able to intercept it, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented plane crashes, building explosions, and killing people because we were able to learn about those plans in advance.”
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will go to Europe to help resolve issues related to alleged U.S. spying abroad and convince Europeans of continuing joint anti-terrorist activities with the U.S., the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organizations because of frustration over the surveillance of the National Security Agency.
“It is really important for the U.S. national security interests that the Europeans remain our supporters with our common anti-terrorist efforts,” said Merchman, a first-term Democrat who is the chairman of the Senate’s subcommittee of international relations on European affairs, in an interview with Washington.
“And I’m going to Europe to let them know that we must continue to work in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over these NSA programs.”
The news that the NSA has collected millions of phone records in Europe has worsened relations with some US allies, although the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and which they shared with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents published by Snowund, indicating that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, as well as the phones of about 34 other world leaders.
National Intelligence Director James Clapper defended espionage activities against allies as necessary and said it was commonplace on both sides.
Against the backdrop of this hype, Murphy said his office was organizing a trip to the members of Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hopes that the delegation will include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators must be announced in the coming days.
According to him, the program of the trip is still under development.
While Murphy said the purpose of the trip is to help improve relationships, he said some degree of “feeling hardship” would also be shown.
He said that European leaders should be honest with their people in what spyware they have used for many years.
“While we can change our tracking programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only intelligence activities,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is due to go to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to address the issues of hostility towards the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as U.S. intelligence activities.
In the United States, the school principal fired at teenagers.
The director of one of the American secondary schools, the teenagers literally brought to despair.
The man, according to him, was forced to take a weapon and start shooting.
The incident occurred in Tennessee.
According to the New York Post, young hooligans threw toilet paper at the man’s house.
Because of this, the headmaster of the school opened fire on teenagers, as a result of which several wounds in the leg and arm received a 15-year-old boy.
Since the hooligans were not on the territory of the director’s property, he was charged with an aggravating attack.
The man was released from prison on bail of $ 125 thousand.
The shooting of civilians in the United States is becoming a terrible pattern.
On the eve of the man opened fire in the center of the city of Rijdccs in the US state of California right on passers-by on the street.
After that, the criminal took hostage two random passers-by, hid them in the trunk of the car and tried to escape.
Earlier, a shooting was opened at the Newtown Elementary School, Connecticut.
Adam's mother worked at the school, she was a teacher.
Shooting at American school: injured 14-year-old girl

Published the call Chinese newspaper “to be reorganized”
The Chinese newspaper, which published on the front page a call for the release of the defendant in the defamation of the reporter, should be reorganized, the press regulator reports.
Published in Guangzhou, the newspaper “New Express” made an unexpected public statement asking for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had taken bribes for writing false articles about a company with a state-owned ownership company.
Now the "New Express" must pass the "complete correction process", as reported by the regulator.
The order to “correlate errors” came from the Guangdong Press and Publications Authority, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation revealed that the New Express newspaper owned by Yangcheng Evening News Group published several false reports about Zoomion listed on the stock exchange between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The management of the editorial office of the New Express was disoriented,” the regulator said in a statement.
He reports that it was decided to “impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of a revocation of his reporter’s license.”
He also “signed the instruction to Yangcheng Evening News Group to carry out a complete correction of errors in the New Express and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the situation-related officials of the newspaper and immediately make changes to the leadership of the New Express”.
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express, in which he claimed financial disruptions in a construction-based company called Zoomlion.
After he was detained, his newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page, saying that she supported his journalistic activities.
But Mr. Chen then appeared on state television with recognition that he published false articles for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion, as well as the entire news media industry and its ability to trust the public,” he told state broadcasting company CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was thirsting for money and fame.
I realized my guilt.
After Mr. Chen’s confessions, the New Express published an apology on the front page, saying the newspaper had failed to properly verify his reports.
Recently, several high-ranking suspects made confessions on television.
Experts say the practice of knocking out confessions in China is still widespread, despite recently adopted amendments to laws prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to self-registration.

Adults are also afraid of unclean power.
In the summer, for example, a hospital was closed in Zimbabwe due to the fact that medical personnel were also attacked by goblins.

Rescue officer Andy Clayton said, “She was in a dangerous position.”
It was right in the middle of the steep slope – 50 feet to the top and to the ground.
She did not move the muscle during the rescue, she completely froze.
But she's fine now.
Then she ate cookies.
It was a very unusual challenge.
The fact that the dog was noticed is incredible.
Rescue specialist officer Peter Lau said, “Ruby is very lucky to have been saved.”

It was very brave – what they did.
We are so grateful, and each of them was absolutely amazing.
Mr Alderson of Kitley added: “We were afraid she might fall, but she stayed there.”
Firefighters were amazing.
I just can't believe she was there.

“We will definitely analyze the causes of the incident and draw our own conclusions from this, but it is completely impossible to prevent such incidents,” he admitted.
Recall that on November 1, the Anonymous Ukraine group posted an appeal on the network, in which it confirmed the hacker attack on the website of the Ministry of Defense of Estonia and opposed the partnership between Ukraine and NATO.
We want the NATO leadership to hear our voice, the voice of the Ukrainian people.
We must not be a servant of NATO.
Ukrainians do not want to die for the interests of NATO member countries.
Ukraine does not need a NATO bloc.
Ukraine does not need the European Union.
Ukraine does not need Russia either.
Ukraine should not be a slave to anyone.
We stand for an independent Ukraine.
“Hands off Ukraine,” Anonymous said in a statement.
Earlier, the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine reported that the company of the Marine Corps of the Feodosia separate battalion of the Ukrainian marines will take part in the command-staff exercises of the NATO Steadfast Jazz-2013 response forces.
Japan will discuss with Russia the issue of concluding a peace treaty
Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty between the two countries.
"You would like to frankly exchange views on the further development of political dialogue, discuss issues related to the conclusion of a peace treaty," Kisid said at the meeting.
The Minister of foreign Affairs of Japan recalled that after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Russia, relations between the countries became warmer and became more bilateral.
The Russian minister, in turn, noted that Russia will meet Japan in solving complex political issues, writes RIA Novosti.
The conclusion of a peace treaty between Japan and Russia implies the solution of the disputed Northern Territories.
In this regard, in Tokyo today there are protests demanding the return of the lands lost after the Second world war to the country.
In the Japanese capital, cars drive, from which the loudspeaker comes: “Return the northern territories!”.
The police do not stop the protesters, they make sure that the noise level does not exceed.
Halloween 2013 in numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, do not go to bed late and arrange a masquerade for our district.
I'm more like a miser.
I have not been called upon in the last two years to distribute candy in my apartment and, most likely, will not be this year.
However, statistics show that I am a white crow in terms of Halloween.
According to the National Retail Federation, the majority of Americans – namely 158 million – will celebrate Halloween this year and spend a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and jewelry.
The only thing I expect every Halloween is trends.
The National Retail Federation predicts that the costumes will take out $ 1.2 billion of the spent $ 6.9 billion.
This year at the peak of fashion, sexual inanimate objects.
Women no longer have to be women in sexual professions; they may also be a sexy meal, such as pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I think we’ll see a lot of zombies thanks to “The Walking Dead,” and I’m sure Daft Punk astronauts will get into our Instagram tapes this year.
According to Google, the costumes that are most often searched are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
There is nothing wrong with the traditional approach.
We dressed our dogs last year and, to my surprise, we weren’t the only ones.
Moreover, according to the National Retail Federation, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet suits.
It means a lot of funny hot dogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't getaway.
The Americans will spend $1.9 billion on them this year, according to Nielsen.
This is about 600 million pounds of Hershey chocolate, candy, Mill Duds candy, Twizzers chewing sweets and Clark Bar bars.
According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, this is a great news for 41 million candy-demand children who have been prepared to conquer our areas.
Moreover, we will buy and – not to deceive ourselves – we will eat 90 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
The only thing we don’t want to eat is corn grain candy; and yet, according to the National Confectionery Association, nearly 35 million pounds are sold for Halloween.
That’s about 9 billion individual corn grains.
It's a mystery that I've yet to solve.
Nothing expresses the essence of Halloween like at home with ghosts.
They have amazing names, such as “Horror Behind the Walls” (which, by the way, is in a real prison), “How and screaming” and “House of Shock”.
Moreover, according to the American Haunts society, there are 1200 officially recognized haunted houses that generate about $500 million in revenue, as well as those stunning photos where you almost peed, which your friend posted on Facebook, and you can not remove, and then the guy you like sees this photo and leaves a comment like a “colamic look”.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and cutting Jack’s lamp is like an ornamentation of a Christmas tree, what we’ve been doing since childhood.
Luckily for us, the fashion for a child in the pumpkin began only last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up by cutting out these pumpkins rather than sitting in them.
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, this year Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
Jack’s lamp, slowly drying out on your porch, probably came from Illinois, which raised 542 million pounds of pumpkin this year.
If you want more difficult tasks, visit Tim and Susan Matisdon in Napa California and try cutting something out of their pumpkin weighing 2032 pounds.
Bayern defender David Alaba became the best athlete of Austria in 2013, according to the official website of the Bundesliga.
In this dispute, he was ahead of representatives of winter sports, who traditionally become the best in the country.
The second place was taken by skier Marcel Hirscher, and the third - ski jumper Gregor Schlierenzerauer.
Last season, the 21-year-old Austrian-Philipino-Nigerian origin helped his team win the Champions League, the championship and the German Cup, as well as in the UEFA Super Cup.
In Kineshma and the area, two men committed suicide
Previously, one of the hangeds has already attempted suicide.
On October 30, at about 1-00, in the village of Lugovoe at his place of residence, a man born in 1947 committed suicide by hanging.
It is known that he had previously attempted suicide.
What prompted the man to such a step is unknown.
On October 31, at 11-50, at the place of residence, a 41-year-old man, a resident of Kineshma, ended his life.
There were no signs of violent death, the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs "Kineshemsky" reports.
Mick Jagger says he didn't flirty with Katy Perry when she was 18
During an interview at an Australian radio show this week, the pop star said she was a backing vocalist for Jagger's 2004 song Olds dicive hard.
Perry said she had dinner with a rocker veteran, and said, “He was flirting with me when I was 18.”
She added: “It was a long time ago and he was very kind.”
In a statement on Thursday, a representative of seventy-year-old Jagger said he “categorically denies that he has ever hit Katie Perry.”
The representative added: “Maybe she’s confusing him with someone else.”
Perry was among the performers who appeared as guests on this year’s Rolling Stones tour.
Her new album, Prism debuted at number one this week.
Discovered a U.S. Tunnel – Mexico for drug trafficking equipped with its own railway
Found one of the most complex drug smuggling tunnels between the US and Mexico, equipped with its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail system.
U.S. authorities have described this four-piece tunnel four-piece as one of the most difficult secret moves ever found.
This tunnel, whose zigzags are the length of almost six football fields, connects warehouses near the city of Tijuana (Mexico) and San Diego (USA).
The area is filled with inconspicuous warehouses, which facilitates the hidden load of drugs into trucks.
The tunnel was closed before any drugs were imperceptibly transported through it, as stated by the authorities.
According to court documents, law enforcement officers confiscated eight and a half tons of marijuana and 327 pounds of cocaine when the tunnel was found.
Three men who, according to law enforcement, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine for the purpose of spreading.
If convicted, they face prison terms ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers use vast underground drainage canals.
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Several major tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the marijuana harvest in October, which set a difficult task for drug cartels to quickly deliver their product to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passage of about 700 yards long, equipped with rail tracks that were coming from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to two San Diego warehouses.
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, who died on a “ridiculous accident”, believe that their son was killed
The parents of a teenager from Georgia, whose body was found inside the scored-out sports mat in his high school gym, believe their son was killed, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a vertically standing mate, leaning at the rear of the stands in the gym of his high school.
Investigators of the Looundes County Sheriff’s Office concluded that Johnson died tragically, but the family of a 17-year-old boy disputes it.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was killed,” Benjamin Crump, a lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.
They never believed that he died the way the sheriff says.
“They believe that this is contrary to logic, laws of physics, and common sense,” Cramp said.
They think it’s a cover to protect the person or people responsible for their son’s death.
“They sent their son to school with a school bag, and they returned him to a corpse bag,” he said.
U.S. lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting an official investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remain unanswered.
What caused the death?
Was his death the result of a crime?
Moore made a statement at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will study all the facts wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
“I am of the opinion that there are sufficient grounds” for an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy showed that Johnson died as a result of “positional asphyxia”.
However, the second autopsy, according to Moore, showed another cause of death.
“There are a few questions that need to be resolved or clarified,” he said.
Moore added that if he finds enough evidence to demand a criminal or civilian investigation into Johnson's death, he would ask the FBI to hold it.
A representative of the County Sheriff’s Lawndes was not available for comment when he was approached on Thursday.
A South Georgia judge ordered authorities on Wednesday to publish all video footage of the security cameras reviewed by investigators.
The teenager’s parents said they hope that the video contains the key to unraveling how he died.
Pakistani authorities begin talks with local Taliban
Pakistani authorities have begun talks with the Taliban.
This was reported by the Embassy of this country in the UK, where the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif is on a visit.
The head of the government of Pakistan made a statement on negotiations with Islamic extremists during a meeting with British Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, with whom he discussed the issues of relations between Pakistan and India, the global energy market and economic reforms in Pakistan.
"The prime minister said the dialogue with the Taliban has begun," the Pakistan Embassy in London said in a statement.
“He said he hopes and prays for the dialogue to work in accordance with the Constitution of Pakistan,” the diplomats added.
The Pakistani Taliban (Tehrik-and-Taliban Pakistan) are allies of the Afghan movement of the same name, but operate independently of it in the northwestern regions of the country bordering Afghanistan.
The Pakistani Taliban are seeking the creation of an Islamic state.
Earlier, the government of Islamabad attempted to start negotiations with the local Taliban, but the movement refused to dialogue.
It stated that it would negotiate only if the authorities withdraw troops stationed in the areas where the Taliban operate, and also release the arrested Islamists from prisons.
Nawaz Sharif arrived in London for the World Islamic Economic Forum.
On Tuesday, October 29, British Prime Minister David Cameron, the head of the Pakistani government and Afghan President Hamid Karzai held a trilateral meeting in London, at which the prospects for the peace process in Afghanistan were discussed.
Goalkeeper “Neftekhimik” Matt Dalton refused to comment on the departure of Vladimir Krikunov from the post of mentor of Nizhnekamsk.
The goalkeeper believes that the acting head coach Dmitry Balmin enjoys great authority among the players and will cope with his duties.
We will remind, today “Neftekhimik” dismissed Krikunov.
To be honest, I would not like to comment on the dismissal of Vladimir Krikunov, ”Dalton quotes RIA Novosti.
I can only say that Dmitry Balmin will cope with the obligations imposed on him - I have no doubt about this.
In the team, he enjoys great authority, this young specialist definitely has a great future.
Pawnshop owners in Singapore are doing well, while middle class is experiencing difficulties
At a pawnshop at the Bendemir shopping center in Singapore, Janani Amirthhaling is pawns a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay for his daughter’s schooling.
“My husband and I just bought a house, so all my money is invested there,” says Ms. Amirthhalinga.
Although she earns S$3000 ($2400) a month as an administrator and her husband also works, the monthly family income is not enough, she says.
Indeed, demand in various parts of Southeast Asia — where household debt is rising — such as ValueMax where it is running its deal, this week has become the third pawnshop listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
A jewelry secured loan is not just a quick way to get money (S$1300 in the case of Ms. Amirthhaling), but almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Typically, pawnshops in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17% – just above 15.4% offered at United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, pawnshops have the advantage that they do not require proof of credit or salary evidence and can issue loans faster than banks.
Therefore, millions of people across the region go to pawnshops, as families feel pressured by rising cost of living and rapid growth in household debt and consumer debt.
After five years of steady growth that followed the global financial crisis, and cheap loans fueled by free monetary policies in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pawnshops to offset incomes as their economies slowed down.
This week, Standard & Poor’s, the rating agency, indicated an increase in family leverage, mainly due to mortgage growth, as a risk factor for Asian banks’ creditworthiness.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore had the highest ratio of household debt to gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia topped the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60% in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which this week barely came out of a technical recession.
On Thursday, the data showed an ongoing decline in exports and a weakening of consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising prices, people in the middle and lower [income scales] will look for ways to replenish their income where they can,” says Song Sung Wong Wong, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Record high gold prices in the last two years have intensified the hastened, with which people lay their personal belongings, as they use the opportunity to get money for their family jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items laid in 200 pawnshops of the city-state are gold products.
People say, “The price of gold looks good, let’s put the granny’s gold chain and get it back next month.”
In Thailand, the largest operator of pawnshops EasyMoney has seen an increase in the number of customers using its offices in recent months, up to 20%.
Growth in the pawnshop business is such that ValueMax, the operator of the branch in Bendemir and 15 others in Singapore, plans to expand not only in neighboring Malaysia, where it has four stores, but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, executive director of ValueMax.
The company will finance the expansion, using 60 percent of the S$66 million raised this week as a result of the placement of shares on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some creditors have sparked criticism from the high interest rates, Ms. Yeh said the pawnshop not only offers cheaper tariffs than other lenders, it also doesn’t increase debt directly.
“Customers are laying items they already own, and monetizing personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The pledge is gaining increasing public acceptance as a means of obtaining short-term, secured funding.
And at the same time, pawnshops are used not only by those categories of people who are in a difficult financial situation.
Rich people in Singapore also use ValueMax divisions by laying gold bars or Rolex watches that can give up to 60 percent of their purchase value in cash.
We see clients from all walks of life.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow money for a short time for commercial projects or investments, or small businesses that need to overcome temporary monetary difficulties,” says Ms. Yeh.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Bashkiria can put grain for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014
Bashkiria in the course of state procurement interventions can put grain for auction no earlier than the beginning of 2014, said the Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Nikolai Kovalenko.
To date, market prices are such that they do not stimulate sales in the intervention fund.
So far, the price in the market is higher, and there is demand.
"It is possible that the grain will be put up for auction, after the New Year," he said at yesterday's press conference.
The minister recalled that this year crops for the harvest of 2013 amounted to 3.1 million hectares, including the area of grain crops - 1.7 million hectares, which is 3.3% more than last year.
For the harvest of 2014 sown 550 thousand. ha (per 105 thousand. more than in 2012).
The area for winter wheat and tricals were increased, the rye remained at the same level.
In the Voronezh region detained a football fan who broke the window in the waiting room of the station
At nine o'clock in the evening on October 29 at the station Gruzi-Voronezh transport police officers removed from the passenger train two football fans - natives of the Moscow region.
Going to the game of their favorite team, the guys on the way arranged a drunken brawl on the train.
The young people were taken to the duty part of the line police department at the Drozhian station to draw up a protocol on an administrative offense.
There, the fans repented of their anti-social behavior.
The police issued administrative material on them and released them.
The young people bought tickets for the next train and at the station station began to wait for his arrival.
In the first half of the night, fans left the railway station building, but one of them, a 22-year-old boy, suddenly returned and broke his window of the front door in the waiting room of the station.
On the ringing of the broken glass rushed the employee of the transport police and the guard of the PSC "RZD".
They managed to detain the attacker who tried to escape from the scene.
Employees of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia are checking.
The issue of initiating a criminal case is being raised, said the senior referent of the direction of information and public relations of the South-Eastern LU of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia on transport Sergey Olkhovik.
Russian security forces do not know anything about the group "Brotherly Circle" - Novye Izvestia
About it writes INTERFAX.RU with reference to an informed source in law enforcement agencies of the Russian Federation.
“After reports appeared in the media about the inclusion of the US Treasury Department in the checklists on suspicion of belonging to the Eurasian criminal syndicate “Brotherly Circle”, we reviewed all the databases, but such a group was not found,” the source said.
In his opinion, the dissemination of this information contributes to the maintenance of the myth of the so-called Russian mafia, which allegedly operates abroad.
As previously wrote “NI”, yesterday the US Treasury Department published on its website a list of alleged members of the criminal group “Brotherly Circle”.
Among them was named and Russian singer Grigory Leps.
He appears on the list as "Grisch", posted the day before.
With the data of the popular Russian performer, they coincide.
The exact name is indicated - Grigory Lepsevridze, creative pseudonym, place and date of birth.
In addition to Leps, there are five more people.
Two Russians, an Israeli citizen, a citizen of Uzbekistan and another native of the former USSR, whose citizenship is not specified.
In the United States are sure that Grigory Leps, who lives on the island of Phuket transported money for bandits on their order.
To this message is attached a photo of the singer and all his data that correspond to reality is indicated.
Moreover, Leps really recently bought a house in Phuket.
The ministry noted that they intend to impose sanctions against Leps.
The inclusion of a person in the blacklists of the US Treasury entails the blocking of his assets in the United States and a ban on business contacts with him of persons living in the United States.
Leps’ assistant Maya Serikova said that no notifications to the singer were received: “It is difficult to answer the question, whether it is Grigory, which everyone is talking about now in connection with the scandal in the United States.”
All Leps knows is media information.
Officially, there were no notifications to him personally, although I do not know whether they are in such cases.
“And, of course, this is all, on the one hand, funny, and on the other – surprisingly and unexpectedly,” she said.
According to her, Grigory Leps does not live in Phuket, but, according to the US Treasury, he really has a house on the Thai island.
She said that Leps is now on a long tour of the Far East and Siberia, and that the news caught him during the flight to the city of Blagoveshchensk.
Is the black box in your car?
While American road designers are trying to find money for the repair of the scattering highway system, many are beginning to see the solution in a small black box neatly attached to the dashboard of your car.
These devices, tracking every mile passing by a motorist and transmitting this information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt to modernize the outdated system of financing of the American highways, undertaken by the planned organs of Washington and the state.
Usually, the boring arena of the planning of highways unexpectedly gave rise to intense debates and colorful alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups in lobbying to give the government the right to use small boxes to track the number of miles you pass and even perhaps where you are passing – and then using that information when compiling tax accounts.
The movement of tea drinking in shock.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and raises a number of questions about privacy.
And although Congress cannot yet agree, continue or not, several states are not going to wait.
They are contemplating how over the next decade you can move on to a system in which drivers pay for every mile of the road they drive.
Thousands of motorists have already taken these black boxes for testing, some of which have the function of satellite tracking.
This is really necessary for our country.
“This is not a question that we can have the right to choose,” said Hassan Ihirata, executive director of the Association of Southern California governments, which is preparing plans to start tracking the state of the miles by each Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be changes in how we pay these taxes.
There are already technologies for this.
The need for this is exacerbated by the lack of funds from the Government’s Road Construction Fund, financed by taxes that Americans pay at gas stations.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars pass more than a gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not want to raise the tax even by one cent at high gasoline prices.
“A gasoline tax is simply impossible to maintain,” said Li Mannich, a transport policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
In his state, a recently installed on the cars of 500 tracking devices for testing the brimgram system.
“This will be the best alternative in the long run,” he said.
Boobs call it a pardon user fee.
It is not surprising that this idea attracts urban liberals, since with the help of taxes it will be possible to change the nature of trips to reduce the congestion of roads and greenhouse gas emissions, for example.
The planned authorities in California are looking into this system in the development of strategies to meet the targets set by the ambitious laws of this state to combat global warming.
However, House member Bill Schuster (Republican, Pennsylvania), chairman of the House of Transport Committee, said he also sees the system as the most viable long-term alternative.
Reason’s free market advocates are also delighted to be forced to pay for every mile.
“It’s not just a tax that will go into a black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of political affairs.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers, who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards surfactory pay.
The US Senate approved last year a pilot project worth $ 90 million, which would take part about 10 000 cars.
However, the leaders of the House of Representatives rejected the proposal because of fears of rural legislators representing voters who often have to travel many miles in their daily lives to get to work or city.
Several states and cities, however, are on their way to go their own.
The greatest enthusiasm is manifested in the state of Oregon, where 5000 drivers are involved in the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon pay the state for miles of mileage instead of a tax on gasoline.
In Nevada, the pilot project has already been completed.
It is being considered in New York.
Illinois will try it on a limited basis with the participation of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes the transport departments of the 17 states of the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is studying how they can make these changes.
This concept has not been universally accepted.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer vehicles were recently equipped with these devices, drivers were concerned that the government could track every move.
“The concern about Big Brother and similar things is a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and efficiency management at the Nevada Department of Transport.
It wasn't what people wanted.
When the tests were in full swing, the branch of the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It will be easy to turn these devices into full-scale tracking devices.”
There is no need to create a huge, bulky technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to store records of everyday movements of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of several states where difficult searches for an inexpensive technology that would allow the state authorities to keep track of passing miles, but without information about the place and time.
If you can do it, said Khan, society will feel more calm.
The search for this technology led some state agencies to a small young company in California called True Mileage.
Initially, this company did not cooperate in the collection of state taxes.
It sought to enter the emerging market of the type of auto insurance, in which drivers pay on the basis of mileage.
But the devices it tests attract road designers because they don’t use GPS and provide a limited amount of information periodically downloaded using modem.
“People will be more inclined to do this if you don’t track their speed and keep track of their location,” said Ryan Morrison, executive director of True Mileage.
There were a few big mistakes in some of these state pilot programs.
There are much less expensive and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, designers are experimenting with the provision of various options to drivers.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they can completely abandon the device, deciding instead to pay a fixed fee based on the average number of miles that all residents of the state pass.
Elsewhere, they hope to sell the idea of a wary public, forcing the devices to do more, rather than less.
In New York, transport officials are aiming to develop a taxable device that will also accept payment on parking meters, provide “paying like driving” insurance, and collecting a pool of speed data in real time from other drivers that motorists could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automobilists will be involved in the benefits that will be offered to them,” the document says.
Some transport system designers, however, wonder if all the talk about pardon is just a huge distraction.
In the San Francisco Bay City Transport Commission, officials say Congress could very easily overcome the bankrupt of the trust fund for road construction by lifting gasoline taxes.
An additional one-time or annual tax could be levied on hybrid drivers and others whose vehicles do not use a lot of gasoline to pay their fair share.
“There’s no need for a radical surgery when all you have to do is accept aspirin,” said Randy Rentschler, director of the Commission on Legislation and Public Relations.
If we do, hundreds of millions of drivers will worry about their privacy and many other things.
Pope Francis will name the first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will build new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time in his service on February 22, as announced on Thursday by the Vatican.
Cardinals are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope, and they are the ones who choose the popes, so that Francis will appoint his first group of people who will eventually participate in the choice of his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, after reaching the 80-year-old cardinal, he can no longer take part in the elections of the pope - this is the prerogative of group 120 of the cardinals-choberdrisons.
In announcing the news, Vatican spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said that before the ceremony of erecting a meeting of all current cardinals, known as the consistency, will be held in the rank.
“Papa Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene a consistency in February in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings involving cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of cardinal electoral artists would likely decline by February.
He said that the pope usually names as many cardinals as necessary to bring the number of cardinal electors to 120, as well as as as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wished.
The consistory next year will be of great importance because it will be the first since the election of Francis in March this year, according to Valero.
At the moment, there is a kind of bias in favor of Europe and especially in favor of Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from other regions of the world to restore balance,” he said.
In South America, forty percent of Catholics live, but they are represented by a negligible number of cardinals.
These will also be the first chosen cardinals since Francis formed the Council of Cardols, a group of eight cardinals from around the world, who is tasked with looking for ways to reform the church.
In the past, Dad decided everything on his own.
“Francis has now chosen eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He said that “it is quite possible” that Francis would appeal to the cardinals for advice.
But we weren’t in such a situation before – all this is for us for the first time.
Valero said the popes usually elevated the ministers of the major parishes, but Francis is “filling at surprises — so we don’t know who he will name.”

Tax for foreign property owners will lead to the fact that the London bubble will burst
The treasury has complied with a preliminary assessment of the capital gains tax measure, but expects a final decision from Mr. Osborne, who in the 2012 budget introduced a state duty rate of 7% for homes worth more than £2 million and annual payments for buyers who decide to own houses in a partnership, and not as individuals.
At the moment, the state duty on residential real estate in the districts of Westminster, Kensington and Chelsea, amounted to 708 million pounds in the 2012/13 financial year, already exceeds the total amount for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the north-east, the north-west, Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr. Cook said: “After increasing the state duty on expensive homes and introducing related anti-evaluation legislation, it is very difficult to say that the taxation of expensive real estate is understated regardless of the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.”
“But this step may lead to some foreign investors reluctant to buy property in London or its current owners will not want to sell it,” he added.
The cost of first-class real estate – the top 5-10% of the housing market at a price-rich Southwest Belt of London, which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen by a record 11.8% over the past year.
According to a study by Savills, prices in the center of London continued to show steady growth of 5.6% year-on-year, but they were eclipsed by an actively developing “domestic market” with a surge in prices in the southwest, in the north (7.4%) and in the east (6.5%) of the city.
The regular meeting of the Association of Machine Builders of the Tyumen Region was held on the basis of the Yalutorovsky Automobile Plant.
Within the framework of the event, a presentation of a new line for the production of electric welded steel pipes was held.
According to the commercial director of the enterprise Denis Gribanov, in 2011 with the advent of the new owner, a marketing study was conducted on the study of the market for steel structures in the Tyumen region.
It turned out that the region consumes more than 50 thousand tons of electric welded pipes per month.
After that, it was decided to change the profile of the plant and install equipment on it for their production.
Already this year, more than 7 thousand tons of manufactured products were shipped.
Investments in the plant amounted to more than 120 million rubles, - said Denis Gribanov.
In October, a new mill was launched, which allows you to increase the range.
The plant produces both a small profile of the pipe, which is used for the greenhouse, small forms of construction and in the furniture industry, and large - for the construction industry.
We plan to reach the level of production of 50 thousand tons of products per year, which will be about 10 percent of its consumption in the Tyumen region.
Despite the transition to another type of activity, the number of employees at the enterprise has not decreased - now it is 157 people, in the plans for the purchase of new equipment - an increase in staff by more than 50 employees.
The company is retraining of personnel, and the necessary specialists are selected from the existing ones.
Next year, it is planned to introduce a new unit of longitudinal cutting of steel with a thickness of up to five millimeters, which will reduce the cost of production, as well as another mill, with a pipe production speed of up to 47 meters per minute.
By the end of 2014, the company is going to master the production of pipes that are used in the housing and communal services.
The management of the enterprise sets the task of closing up to 70 percent of the needs of the Tyumen region in these products.
Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostromumov, addressing the heads of production, advised to pay more attention to the modernization of machine-building enterprises.
This is also aimed at the forms of state support for industry, which include the reimbursement of interest rates on loans for the purchase of new equipment and the costs of its leasing.
This year, 150 million rubles are provided for these purposes, two-thirds of this amount has already been spent.
The last commission, which will consider subsidy agreements, accepts documents from enterprises until November 15.
In addition, the budget reimburses the costs of the participation of local producers in international fairs.
For next year, the budget provides funds in the amount of 150 million rubles, which can be used to compensate for leasing payments and loans for the purchase of new equipment.
5 million will be allocated for participation in fairs, 3 million - for energy saving programs.
Reduce up to 72 million rubles of funds for the reimbursement of the ordered and paid equipment, which is produced in the south of the Tyumen region for the oil and gas complex.
According to Leonid Ostroumov, in the future, this form of support will stop, since the motive for its introduction was the compensation of the mineral extraction tax, which the oil companies paid to the regional budget.
Currently, they do not do so and subsidies become direct expenditure obligations of the region.
With this in mind, the regional government considers the direct support of industrial enterprises, not financing the oil industry through them.
Budget assistance will be associated with investment projects that will be implemented in production.
Many business leaders expressed concern about the current situation with oil workers.
The subsidy for the equipment they purchase is a competitive advantage of the industry of the south of the Tyumen region, and if it is canceled, it will be difficult to compete at a price with the middle zone of Russia, where cheaper labor.
In addition, the issue of continuity of the new owner of TNK-BP - Rosneft, which does not yet place its orders at Tyumen enterprises, is unclear.
The agreement on the implementation of the Uvat project expires in 2013, and no applications for its extension have been received.
Currently, enterprises in the south of the region, which specialize in equipment for the oil and gas sector, can not form a portfolio of orders for next year.
The question remains whether taxes will be received from the oil produced in the Uvatsky district in the regional budget or they will be paid at the place of registration of the new owner of the fields.
The II Congress of the Peoples of the Southern Urals was held in Chelyabinsk.
The forum is timed to the Day of National Unity, the 400th anniversary of the restoration of Russian statehood and the 20th anniversary of the adoption of the Constitution of Russia.
The congress was attended by delegations from all cities and districts of the region, representatives of national and cultural associations, religious denominations, legislative and executive authorities - a total of about 350 people.
The course of the forum is aimed at strengthening interethnic harmony.
We can here show an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no discrepancies or disagreements.
We live in full understanding,” says Theophan, Metropolitan of Chelyabinsk and Zlatoustovsky.
During the meeting, a number of issues were considered, including the education of patriotism, cultural cooperation.
As a result of the congress, a resolution was adopted.
The unofficial part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theater.
Here opened an exhibition of national-cultural associations of the Chelyabinsk region.
Syria has destroyed its chemical weapons manufacturing, the observation team says
Syria has destroyed the main equipment for the production of chemical weapons and ammunition with poison gas, an international observation team said on Thursday, while violent collisions raged in the north of the country, near one of the facilities where toxic substances are believed to be stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian group of activists said that more than 120 000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war in the country almost three years ago.
The Organization's statement on the prohibition of chemical weapons was made one day before
The deadline for 1 November, established by this organization based in The Hague, in order for Damascus to destroy or “machify” all means of production of chemical weapons and mechanisms to confuse chemicals with the receipt of poison gas and fill ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial stage of destruction is an important milestone in an ambitious schedule that aims to destroy all of Damascus’s chemical weapons by mid-2014.
Destruction of equipment means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Nevertheless, Damascus has yet to begin the destruction of existing weapons and stockpiles.
The country is believed to have about 1000 metric tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and sarin nerve gas.
The announcement was made during fierce fighting on Thursday in the city of Safira, which, according to experts, is a chemical weapons production facility, as well as its storage, according to the British-based Syrian Center for the Protection of Human Rights.
A group of activists who tracked losses through a network of activists in Syria said on Thursday that 120 296 people were killed.
Of these, 61,067 are civilians, including 6365 children.
On the part of the government, the group said, 29,954 people are members of the armed forces of President Bashar al-Assad, 18 678 are pro-government militants and 187 Lebanese militants of Hezbollah.
Also among the dead, as stated in the statement, were 2202 army defectors and about 5375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
According to the UN assessment of July 25, 100,000 died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this figure has not been updated.
The conflict forced about 2 million people to flee the country.
Assad’s troops have been fighting rebels for several weeks in Safira, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda groups.
The center said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but did not provide specific data.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors, driven by their mission to rid a toxic arsenal of Syria, in the midst of an ongoing civil war.
In a statement to the OPCW, which works in close cooperation with the United Nations, said that its team was “is satisfied with the fact that it has tested and saw all the critical means of production and mixing/fuel equipment destroyed by the Syrian.”
She added that “no additional inspection activities are currently planned.”
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 facilities declared by Damascus.
They were unable to visit two places for security reasons, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said that both seats were, according to a statement by Syria, “abandoned and... The chemical weapons program items in them have been moved to other claimed locations that have been checked.”
It was not immediately possible to find out whether the object in Safira was one of the two places that the OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which is due to be approved next month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I welcome the courage and bravery you have all demonstrated in the most complex mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Ahmet Uzyumciu’s supervisor’s director general in a comment published by the OPCW.
For the third year, the civil war has been facing rebels, mostly Sunni Muslims, with the Assad government and its security forces, which consist of members of his sect of Alawite, the branch of Shiite Islam.
As for other events, the head of the center, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday at an air defense facility in the coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he said.
Obama campaign considers Biden’s exclusion in favor of Hillary Clinton
According to The New York Times, the closest advisers to President Barack Obama secretly considered the possibility of replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton’s candidacy in the 2012 election list.
This discovery is the brightest sensation of all the expected book by Mark Galperin and John Hailemann about the 2012 campaign “Stages Doubled: The Game Has Changed 2012”.
The Times received a copy of the upcoming book and reported on Thursday evening that the president’s closest aides had “large-scale research in focus groups and opinion polls at the end of 2011” to assess whether Biden’s excluding could help raise fading hopes for Obama’s re-election.
According to the political observer of The Times, Jonathan Martin, the book gives a detailed description of the attempt of high-ranking officials of the election headquarters of the White House, namely the former head of the White House administration, Bill Daley, to assess what effect the appointment of former Secretary of State Clinton as vice president.
Possible replacement was a secret, carefully guarded at the Chicago Pre-election headquarters and in the Oval Office.
Only six closest advisers to the president — including Daley, the former head of Obama’s campaign Jim Messina and former senior White House advisers David Axelrod and David Pluff — knew the replacement was under consideration.
The Bets is doubled claim that Daley was the initiator of trying to replace Biden despite their “close personal relationships,” but ultimately abandoned that step when their data showed that adding Clinton to the electoral list would not “improve significantly Obama’s chances.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration did consider replacing Biden Clinton.
“I actively spoke out for a lot of things, and it was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
You must remember that the president was in terrible shape at the time, so we thought, “Oh, my God, what should we do?”
Although Daley described the study as “necessary verification,” Martin told CNN’s representative Anderson Cooper that the campaign headquarters invested a lot in examining whether this step would bring dividends on the vote.
“Pre-election headquarters don’t spend that amount of money on surveys and focus groups if they don’t consider anything seriously,” Martin said in the AK 360 program.
It is unclear, however, whether Obama knew that his team was studying the possibility of replacing.
Martin told CNN what he asked Daly if his boss knew about a possible fight.
Although Daley said he didn’t think the president was “full-backed” of a possible replacement, the former head of administration admitted that he “maybe,” Obama knew.
Martin added that the “Stages are doubled” does not give a clear answer to the question of whether the results of political sensing reached the Obama table.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously believed that Obama was unaware of the study of the possibility of removing Biden from the electoral list.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
The head of the control and disciplinary Committee of the RFU Artur Grigoryants said that “Kuban” was fined 500 thousand rubles, reports from the Football House correspondent “SE” Philip PAPENKOV.
Such sanctions against the Krasnodar club were used for the arson of the flag of Dagestan by fans on the podium during the home match of the 14-th round against Anzhi.
At the meeting there were representatives of both clubs, a person from the RFPL.
We have examined all available materials.
For the ill-conceit behavior of the audience "Kuban" was fined 500 thousand rubles.
Legislative bans forced Russians to drink less beer
Russian brewers are in a bad mood.
According to their estimates, the consumption of beer in the country next year will remain at the same level, and this is at best.
Although businessmen initially counted on growth.
After all, this year is unsuccessful for them: sales fell by 7 percent.
All this was told by the head of one of the largest brewing companies of the country, Chairman of the Council of the Union of Russian Brewers Isaac Sheps at the III annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute "Products of everyday demand in Russia", which has just ended in Moscow.
It discussed state market regulation.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian beer market has already decreased by 18 percent, since in recent years there has been a significant increase in the regulation of the brewing industry in terms of the production and turnover of beer - a drink with a low alcohol content, Sheps listeners said.
No country in the world is there such a strict restriction of the beer market, the unpredictable introduction of new and new illogical bans that are justified by the alleged fight against alcohol abuse.
The brewer complained that many legislative prohibitions, designed to reduce the level of alcohol abuse, do not have a special impact, however, new initiatives are constantly emerging.
The more painfully, beer producers was hit by a ban on selling alcohol in kiosks introduced this year.
“We immediately lost 35 thousand consumers,” Isaac Sheps said.
Next year, brewers have two predictions.
Optimistic - the one about which Sheps spoke: sales of foam drink will remain at the same level.
Pessimistic - will fall by another 2-3 percent.
To save their profits, businessmen are forced to leave the varieties designed for the mass consumer to the "premium" class: beer will be less, but it will cost more.
Meanwhile, the radical consequences of the fall in sales with a small amount of alcohol are not yet visible.
"According to my observations, the level of alcoholism disease remains at about the same level," said the narcologist Alexey Sotnikov.
True, the share of patients who consume strong drinks surrogates, as well as those who “sed” on alcohol-containing tonic drinks like Jaguar, while ten years ago it was “beer” alcoholism that prevailed.
What will lead to the construction of TPU in Moscow
Every year, the capital authorities promise to equip more and more transport and interchange hubs (TPU).
Until 2020. It is planned to put into service 255 TPUs.
What the project actually turns out, our correspondent understood.
A couple of months ago, the metro station "Smolenskaya" Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line had a construction fence.
The inscription read that there was an arrangement of the transport and transfer hub.
All this was very strange, because next to the "Smolensk" no land transport stops and, therefore, it is impossible to transfer to it.
To get to the nearest trolleybus stop on the Garden Ring, you need to overcome about 130 meters, including the ground crossing of Karmanitsky Lane.
Now the "Smolenskaya" is almost over.
The flower stall disappeared, the stand for newspapers was dismantled, and the asphalt was replaced by paving stones before the entrance.
Here is the entire transport hub.
Transport and interchange units are flat and capital, - explained in the press service of the Moscow Department of transport.
There are no capital TPUs yet.
And flat ones involve the construction of parking lots, the withdrawal of retail facilities that interfere with the movement of passengers, the creation of small architectural forms and improvement.
Actually, flat TPUs are not even engaged in transport workers, but professional landscapers from the Department of capital repairs of the city of Moscow.
The transport hub is not necessarily a complex design, ”explains Mikhail Blinkin, director of the Institute of Transport Economics and Transport Policy of the Higher School of Economics.
Sometimes a roof over your head and a scoreboard are enough to notify about the time of arrival of the transport.
Here, for example, at the metro "Yasenevo" recently opened a quite full flat interchange unit.
Let without canopies, but with intercepting parking lots and scoreboards indicating when the bus arrives.
But in the pursuit of the number, officials write down everything that gets into the TPU.
Back in 2011, the mayor’s office planned to build 151 knots for everything, 59 of them with capital construction.
Now the plans until 2020 are as many as 255 TPUs.
One and a half of them promise to pass this year.
Although there is a program for the development of TPU in the city, there are no qualitative criteria, - says Alexander Morozov, co-chairman of the public organization "City and Transport".
Report by the number of objects, but the quality of the transfer on each of them often deteriorates.
The criteria, according to the expert, should be two: firstly, a decrease in the transfer time, and secondly, convenience.
First of all, the ability to change the type of transport without going out in the rain.
In Moscow, when arranging TPU, sometimes comes exactly the opposite.
A vivid example of the VDNH metro.
Previously, suburban buses from the Yaroslavsk highway came to the square before the main entrance to the All-Union Technical University.
Now their stops were transferred to the opposite side of Yaroslavka to the Cosmonauts Street.
Further from the metro, much farther from the monorail, but closer to residential buildings.
It is a gift that the residents did not want the bus station under the windows and complained to all possible authorities.
With the capital TPU in Moscow somehow did not immediately ask.
The first of them began to build five years ago near the metro "Planernaya".
The project was designed to be exemplary.
And really turned out a sample of how the interchange hub, given to investors, turns into a banal shopping center.
No, there are platforms for buses, a canopy, so as not to go from the subway in the rain, and three floors of car parks.
However, Khimki trolleybuses No. 202 and No. 203 in the Moscow TPU did not give places fundamentally.
They were pushed away from the subway as strangers.
There is more room for trade.
Only the clothes of 32 stores, and in general there is almost everything - from pet goods to the car dealership.
Well, in fact, what if from the passengers of the bus will need to buy a new car on the road?
When we build a capital TPU, for some reason, there is always a shopping center.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical conclusion, when part of the parking lot decided to give to the market.
Now on the third floor of TPU "Planernaya" among the parking spaces marked on the floor is a brisk trade.
Vegetables, spices, Chinese jeans, non-Russian speech and guards, visually pleasing to our photographer.
The transfer hub finally turned into a bazaar.
The fact is that earlier the metro "Planernaya" was a market, but it was demolished.
And in the prefecture, merchants were spared and allowed to intercept the interchange hub.
It’s still empty because of the high prices.
The funny thing is that the market was demolished in order to build in its place. New flat TPU.
That's the castling.
At the Kaluga metro, the distance of the approach from the metro lobby to the bus was 50 meters, - says Alexander Morozov.
After the construction of the shopping center, allegedly TPU, the distance increased to 170 meters.
To get on the bus, you need to go through the entire shopping center.
After 22 hours, when it is closed, you have to bypass it in the open air.
However, the designs on the "Planner" and "Kaluga" will soon seem to be flowers.
In mid-September, the city planning and land commission of the city hall approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPUs.
Four of them will be 25-storey, not counting two or three underground tiers.
The main monster will grow near the metro station "Tushino", it will be 418.7 thousand square meters. Meters of area.
Representatives of the Directorate of Railway Stations, responsible for the construction of TPU near the metro, have already told reporters: in future high-rise buildings will be located shops, hotels and apartments.
At the same time, officials assure that multi-tier parking will take from a third to half of the area.
Take the example of "people's" garages.
For example, a garage for 258 cars, which was recently built on International Street, has an area of 8015 sq.m. meters.
So, for parking for 2.6 thousand cars, "Petrovsko-Dzumovskaya" will need about 80 thousand "squares".
This is less than a third of the machine that they are going to build there.
Let one or two floors go to all sorts of platforms for buses.
There are at least 150 thousand square meters. Meters of Commercial Real Estate.
And this, for a moment, almost two GUMS.
If the capital TPU at the stations and railway stations are built, then the other sites will be mastered by metro.
They also promised that there would be many “functional facilities”, including hotels, offices and even gyms.
By the way, the Department of Property of the city of Moscow recently told reporters that they are developing a draft resolution, according to which investors will be able to apply for a site for TPU directly.
Without any competitions.
Because, they say, transport issues for the city are a priority.
The ideal TPU is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or Spaignin in Toronto, Alexander Morozov is sure.
There, trolleybuses and trams descend underground to the metro level and the distance from the subway car to the tram is only 50 meters without going out.
There's no extra trade around.
But Moscow officials are being put to extreme.
Either we will not build anything, or we will not kill 25 floors with offices and apartments.
Oil fell to $96 per barrel.
The price of oil continued to fall on Friday, as the alarms about the formation of large reserves overshadowed a message showing that China’s energy-intensive manufacturing sector is gaining strength.
The benchmark U.S. oil grade in December delivery fell by 14 cents, and its price was $96.24 per barrel for the late morning European time in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
On Thursday, the contract fell by 39 cents, which in total was a drop in the price for October by 5.8%.
The rich oil reserves have affected its value in recent weeks.
The Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. stockpiles increased by 4.1 million barrels over the past week.
In five weeks, reserves have replenished by more than 25 million barrels.
But on Friday, there was an indication of a possible increase in demand, judging by two reports of Chinese industry, which showed a surge in its activity.
This indicates that China’s economic recovery could continue to gain strength after the third-quarter growth rate rose to 7.8 percent after a 20-year low in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark international oil grade used by U.S. refineries, has fallen by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the Intercontinental Exchange in London.
In Yekaterinburg, the criminal killed two sisters and burned their bodies
In Yekaterinburg, the police are searching for a criminal who brutally killed two sisters.
After the murder, their bodies were burned.
As reported to the “New Region” in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation in the Sverdlovsk region, the day before in the Kirovsky district of the Ural capital after extinguishing a fire in a three-room apartment located in a residential building on Uralskaya Street, found the bodies of two women with signs of violent death.
The identities of the victims were soon identified.
It turned out that these are sisters, one of them is a resident of Yekaterinburg 44 years, the second is a 33-year-old resident of the Orenburg region.
They rented the burned apartment a few days ago.
His investigation took under personal control of the chief police officer of the region Mikhail Borodin.
The internal affairs bodies are working out various versions of the murder, check the alibi of previously convicted citizens and persons prone to such acts.
In addition, it is established for what purpose the woman rented an apartment, and where they lived before, what they were doing, with whom they maintained the relationship.

Coach of "Avant-garde" Vladimir Chebaturkin, speaking about the preparation of his team for the match of the regular championship of the KHL against "Salavat", noted that the Omskhi conducted a thorough analysis of the defeat from the Magnitogorsk "Metallurg".
The specialist stressed that the "Avant-garde" should be given increased attention to the game in defense.
We watched the video of the match against Magnitogorsk "Metallurg", - quotes the official website of "Avant-garde" Chebatirkin's words.
- Missed a lot of goals, not a very pleasant moment.
Passed because of their mistakes, because of the failure to complete the game.
We knew the opponent had the performers.
According to statistics, they had five attacks on the move - three goals were scored for us.
Very good implementation.
Were these mistakes taken into account in preparation for today’s game?
We with the guys carefully analyze each match, talk after the game, prepare for a new opponent.
The main thing is that the installation is carried out.
Everyone saw the first period of the match against Metallurg.
The game was played, and the score was 2:0.
They conceded a goal "in the dressing room" - and in the third period they began to make mistakes.
Given how hard the game was, I did not see the point in connecting the defenders.
We need to defend the whole team.
Now Avangard has a long home series, matches go every other day - the team has accumulated fatigue?
All teams are in the same conditions.
The main thing now is the implementation of your moments and the performance of the game task.
Hockey is an emotional game, if you perform the installation - everything is not so difficult.
Bombardier’s profit decreases with the drop in deliveries and the number of orders for aircraft
Bombardier Corporation, a Canadian manufacturer of aircraft and trains, reported on Thursday a 15 percent reduction in net profit under the influence of reduced orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and problems with contracts in its railway unit.
The Montreal-based company Bombardier also did not publish any flight tests of its latest CSeries aircraft and did not provide new information on whether ambitious plans for the introduction of the aircraft into commercial operation will be fulfilled by next September.
After the first flight of a prototype of the aircraft, which took place about a month and a half ago, he flew only three times, which raises questions about whether the stage of testing on the schedule is underway.
The results did not meet forecasts and led to a fall in shares by more than 8 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered its estimate on Thursday from “above the average market” to “average market” because of the belief that stock growth is limited in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in the number of aircraft shipments was generally predictable, we are certainly disappointed with the performance of the transport department’s profit,” Doerksen said in a stock market review.
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as the flight test program continues.
However, if new orders are not announced in the coming months, we assume that the market will become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will allow it to win a place in the lower price segment of the market, where Boeing and Airbus are now dominated.
The first prototype of the aircraft was presented in March and for the first time made a flight in September after several months of delay.
However, there are not too many solid orders for CSeries yet – 177, as potential buyers are waiting for flight test results to check the company’s statements about the fuel efficiency and potential economy of the new liner.
In total, there are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 customers and operators.
Chief Executive Pierre Baudouan was confident that Bombardier would reach its target of 300 firm orders by the time the first aircraft would be put into commercial operation.
On Thursday, executives also assured analysts and media that the program was moving forward as planned.
“The test model of the aircraft did not stay on the ground for longer than expected,” Bodouan said during a telephone conference, adding that ground tests and software updates were planned for the aircraft’s downtime.
All manufacturers plan to test differently.
We decided to spend the first flight and take a break for updates, so we did.
This will happen throughout the flight test program.
The second of the five test samples is due to fly in the coming weeks and all the others will soon follow it, the company said.
And yet analysts are skeptical of the statement that the first customer will be able to start operating the CSeries aircraft 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier said it is evaluating the commissioning period and will provide new information in the next few months.
“This slow pace of flight tests – at least, apparently, and corresponds to the internal schedule of Bombardier – reinforces our point of view that the commissioning will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter, which ended on September 30, Bombardier’s net income fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, last year.
Adjusted earnings per share remained the same - 9 cents.
Gross income decreased slightly – from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and gross income of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered 45 aircraft per quarter, which is less than the previous year’s figure of 57.
The total number of orders fell from 83 to 26 aircraft.
The portfolio of orders of the aerospace department amounted to $ 32.9 billion as of September 30, without changing from December 31.
“In the aerospace field, the results corresponded to our goals, but a small number of incoming orders and general market conditions have become an unpleasant factor,” said Bodouan.
Gross income in aerospace direction fell by 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train maker, said gross revenue in the sector rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The portfolio of orders in the transport unit amounted to $32.6 billion as of September 30, which is slightly higher than in December 31.
The income of the transport unit was adversely affected by the problems with the execution of several major contracts.
The management said that a new development plan will be presented in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced that Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pechett will join the board of directors, fell by 8.5 percent to C$4.83 at auction in mid-November.
Brazilian company Embraer SA, the world’s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported on Thursday a reduction in quarterly revenue by 10 percent.
The Chairman of the Krasnoyarsk court was stolen from the court, hitting him on the head

According to “Interfax”, late on Wednesday, the attackers hit the judge on the head, which made him confidence.
When the 63-year-old chairman of the court recovered, he found that he had been retracted by an official ID.

The crime and search for criminals are being investigated.
According to a senior official, Israeli military aircraft attack targets inside Syria
A senior administration official in an interview with Fox News confirmed that Israeli warplanes struck a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday evening.
The official did not specify what it was for the target, but said that at least one.
The Assoshiated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125.
At least twice as early as this year, Israel has carried out airstrikes on bombings in Syria.
Is Thorium a new hope for nuclear power?
Governments around the world continue to think about how to meet energy needs.
The burning of hydrocarbons (where they are) negatively affects the climate.
Renewable energy sources require large areas for generation.
Nuclear power is no longer the other, but leaves behind a lot of expensive waste disposal.
Recently, scientists drew attention to Thorium - another radioactive element of the Mendeleev system.
It is found around the world, and, according to experts, its splitting does not leave waste that should be stored for centuries.
In the Moscow metro there will be new machines.
But they will sell tickets to passengers not for money, but for squats.
One trip costing 30 rubles will cost a potential passenger in 30 squats.
The number of squats will count a special device using modern technologies, ITAR-TASS reports with reference to the press service of the Russian Olympic Committee.
The first device will be installed at the station "Exhibition" on November 8, 2013.
In the presentation of the new ticket theaters will be hosted by the President of the Russian Olympic Committee Alexander Zhukov and Olympic champions gymnasts Alexei Nemov and Elena Zamolodchikova.

Two YMCA employees charged with sex crimes before charges against Jonathan Lord, as it became known to the Royal Commission
Two employees of the YMCA NSW were accused of sexual crimes against children before the 2011 charge against a childcare worker in Karingbach Jonathan Lord, the Royal Commission for Child Abuse was told.
But in the introductory statement, the commission said that she “never dealt with cases of sexual abuse of children within her organization.”
Chief Executive Officer Philippe Heir was asked about one case when an employee of YMCA was charged with child pornography crimes and another case when the YMCA Caringbah Hall instructor was convicted of sexual crimes against children under his supervision in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gayle Furness, a lawyer assisting the commission, that he knew about the first case but did not know about the second.
He acknowledged that YMCA in the opening speech to the commission also made inaccuracy, arguing that “there were external YMCA checks that the YMCA was in the forefront of ensuring the safety of children.”
The evidence presented to the commissiones indicate that YMCA was notified that it had received the second from the end of four possible quality audits conducted by the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who joined YMCA when he was 21, admitted that he and the lower leadership had missed by hiring Lord, and also failed to provide a clear understanding by the staff of their obligations regarding reporting violations of children's safety policies.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexual crimes against 12 boys during his two years of his work at the YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
But Mr. Hare rejected the suggestion that the corporate ethics of the YMCA prevented employees from reporting Lord’s security violations in the safety of children.
The staff testified that they were observing violations, including the fact that the Lord was alone with the children, personally cared for them, put them on his knees, said that he loved one of them and allowed them to play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Owell, who was under Lord’s leadership and asked her to teach her the protection of children because she was concerned about his behavior, testified to finding Jackie Barnat, a child custody manager at the YMCA department in Karingbach, who was Lord’s leader, “very frightening and often hard-to-reach.”
The Executive Director said he did not accept the staff’s explanation that he was embarrassed to report the situation to their superiors.
Rather, according to him, their friendship with the Lord took them away from the idea of the need to report about him.
Mr. Heir said he presented to the YMCA Board of New South Wales that the lesson for the organization of “the incident with Jonathan Lord” was not “to provide information” on the part of the staff, and the council agreed to him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the arrival of the charges was made by the YMCA Director-General for child custody Liam Wheatley.
He said it was intended to prevent the damage to the evidence, but they “overdue” and the decision was poorly implemented.
YMCA of New South Wales was not a safe organization for children during the work of Jonathan Lord in the period 2009-2011, said the commission expert on child molestation professor Stephen Smolbon from the University of Griffith.
He said there were “serious problems” in recruiting, selecting, instructing, training and monitoring staff.
The hearings are postponed until December 20.
Guillaume's filming of the novel by Daniel Diderot boasts an exceptional production and historical details, but it is also more heavier to be perceived than it should have.
The film, which takes place in France in the 1760’s, tells the gloomy story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to the monastery by his family.
When she begins to rebel, she experiences extreme cruelty at the hands of a perseverian and becomes the object of erotic fantasies for others.
The film never falls to vulgarity or sensation – and that’s the whole problem.
Because of its serious solemnity, the narrative risks becoming a test like a ruler and for the audience.
U.S. intelligence agencies listen to personal phone of the Pope
The activities of the Vatican are under the vigilant control of the American intelligence services.
New documents from the Edward Snowden collection indicate that U.S. intelligence was wiretapping all the negotiations of the previous Pope Benedict, and is now closely caring for Pope Francis.
His phone began tapped even before he became the head of the Vatican.
The election process of the new pope was also under observation.
What the United States was given special importance.
The special service connected to the cell phones of the cardinals who gathered in Rome to choose another Pope.
The phones of the residence where the participants of the conclave lived were also heard.
American spies listened to all the main contenders for the papacy to prevent the appearance of an undesirable figure for Washington.
Panorama magazine writes that the “big ear of the United States” continued to intercept the conversations of the prelate until the end of the conclave on March 12.
It is alleged that the American Archbishop Bergolio has been allocated since 2005 as the future of the Pope.
U.S. intelligence also served talks related to the election of a new president of the Vatican Bank.
The Italian magazine writes that a secret group of CIA and NSA operatives who extract information about politicians and financial flows continues to work in the U.S. Embassy.
In turn, the Vatican conciliatoryly announced that he did not care about the American “wirety”, even if it does.
From the leadership of the United States, the holy fathers have no secrets.
Ben Greenman: The Tenth Anniversary of the New York City Festival: New Yorker
We can safely say that New York is the birthplace of a stand-up comedy in America: almost a hundred years ago, pop artist Frank Faye, who worked as a conference at the Palace Theatre Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly to the public in a spoken manner.
The Fei innovation was eventually picked up by others, most recently - the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and oversurd by Caroline Hersh, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, numbering more than sixty shows in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of these headliners started in Carolins, and then achieved more success, reached the level when they are too famous to perform at the club,” Hersch said.
We created this festival as a way to continue with them.
This year’s theme features Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Mar, as well as “Stondup for Heroes,” an annual music and comedy charity concert for military veterans at Madison Square Garden, where Bruce Springsteen, John Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby will appear.
With the expansion of the festival, the world of comedy has also expanded.
Several comedians participating in the festival this year have gained popularity in a non-traditional way, for example, thanks to a show on small TV channels like Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll gained fame thanks to his role in a comedy series on a little-known cable channel (delively scabbard “League” on FXX on the theme of fantasy football), and now leads its own sketch show at Comedy Central.
Jenny Slatt joined the cast both in “Saturday Night Live” and “Parks and Recreation”, although she is most known for a series of viral videos “Marseille – a shell in shoes”.
Both Kroll and Slate, like other young comedians with an original style (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jesselnik, a cunning, focused on the racial theme of Camau Bell) is the result of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the highlights of the festival will be David Steinberg’s interview with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up comedian, but then became a successful director on television and in movies, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he was the host of the show on TV Land called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting will be held in the Town Hall in the center of Manhattan.
“This city is certainly the central element of Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He told me that coming here, he sometimes walks through some street between two houses and thinks: “If I stay without money at all, maybe I’ll live here.”
